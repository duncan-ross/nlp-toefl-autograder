From my view, I totally agree with the statement that university students should take part-time jobs. First of all, Taking part-time jobs can develop students' social skills, like communication and cooperation. With these experiences, students will have a better understanding of how to make their career a success after graduation. Moreover, students can earn money through taking part-time jobs, which help them cover their studying and their current life. In the university, students need money for many purposes such as buying specialized books, school fee, rent I think a part-time job is really an effective tool to resolve these problems. Not only does part-time help students to resolve economic problems but it also help students to be an independent person. When taking a part-time job, you may not ask your parents for money and become more independent. Jobs forms you to be responsible, more self-disciplined. If a part-time job which are suitable for your studying branch, it can give you more practical knowledge of your studying, enhances your knowledge. Last but not least, a part-time job can help student to take up some leisure time. In university, students may have lots of leisure time except studying. By doing a part-time job, students can use up their leisure time and have a substantial university life.
