I don't feel that it is that important and only creates hardship for students when they are supposed to be learning as much as they can to graduate with high scores. I was lucky because I didn't need the extra financial support since my parents were kind enough to pay for everything. This allowed me more time to study and also gave me relaxation time as well. I saw many students who were always stressed and rushing around to get to the next class or start their job on time. It was a real hassle for them and a few of them dropped out because they could not cut it. A few of them said that they would return in the Fall or the next year, but that didn't happen and I never saw them again. I am not trying to sound like a hard ass here, but they were never going to finish college anyway I think. A couple of my friends worked and studied and they seemed to have their heads together and did OK. But I believe that they were the exception and not the rule. With all of the study that I had to do, I don't know how I would have been able to work and get the high scores that I did as well. Maybe that's just not me and as I mentioned, it's not something that everybody can do. Students would do so much better if they didn't have to worry about money as well.
