In my opinion, I think that having a part-time job is essential for college students. It provides them several advantages. For one, it will give them something to be busy about. College students are to be considered as adults already for they are expected to be mature enough to know how to use their time wisely. Instead of using their leisure time for senseless things, having a part-time job will make them more productive and more skilful. Since college students are just one step away from having a work or job already, it will be beneficial to them if they will have even a little overview as to how it is like in the real world. They will be exposed to the kind of environment that they might be in once they actually start working. They will be more aware to the right kind of attitudes and behaviors that must be practiced in their respective working area. The experience that they will gain in having a part-time job will give them an edge over the others for they may include it in their resume when they will be applying for a job in the near future. Moreover, it may be a help to their parents for they may earn extra money or income that can also help in their everyday expenses.
