Well I know that this is still a hot issue here in the UK and also in various other countries such as the USA where they are still discussing the effects of the bans that they have in place. There have been numerous debates held on smoking bans all around the world and Japan is no exception. Even though the harmful effects of smoking, both directly and passively, are well known and undeniable, more and more young people are taking up the habit. One of the arguments in favour of the bans suggest that it is good for reducing smoking and also that it recognises the non-smokers' rights. The smokers on the other hand claim that it ignores theirs. The health risks of smoking are clear and many leading medical and scientific organisations recognize that second hand smoke is a possible cause for a range of life threatening conditions. Health concerns could be improved dramatically by simply eliminating smoking altogether. This is unlikely to occur at this stage so the best option would seem to be banning smoking in all public areas and restaurants as well. I believe that people shouldn't have to inhale the deadly chemicals from other people's smoking so on that basis, I agree with a restaurant ban.
