Smoking is very harmful to not only smoker but also non-smoker, because when smoker smoke himself or herself, it can affect around them. I have heard of passive smoking is more harmful than smoker. I think it is very rude action and It should be banned everywhere. I really want to enjoy having a meal in the restaurant, but always someone smoke there even in the no-smoking area. I have heard that smoker don't like passive smoking. If they don't like it, they should be well-mannered to the others. I think smoking should be completely banned at the street. While I walk in the street, I have got unexpected passive smoking. It makes me feel really bad, and get angry. Whenever I meet a person who is smoking in the street, I want to tell them stop smoking while you are walking in the street. Making a section in which smoker can smoke is the best way to prevent this case. All the building make the smoking area, each street make smoking area will make very clean street and happy street for smoker and non-smoker both. It will help also non-smoker's health not to get unexpected passive smoking.
