A part-time college job was one of my favorite parts of college. I was able to meet new friends, learn new things, and make a respectable amount of money (for a college student) all while earning credit towards my undergraduate degree. Although now I am too busy with research for my Ph. D. to have a part-time job any longer, I still miss the days of my part-time job. I worked at a small ice cream store that was very close to my college. Even though the hourly wages were rather low, I was able to learn how ice cream is made which is something that not a lot of people can say. In the same way as me, I am sure that there are hundreds of thousands of students who are able to learn some new or unique thing that they would not be able to learn if they never had a part-time job. Furthermore, employers give preference to applicants with work experience especially if that experience is related. Along the same lines, preference would be given to an applicant with work experience over and applicant with no work experience. As a result, it clearly makes sense for most college students to seek out and find a part-time job.
