Stepping into a restaurant, how many times have we seen those people with a lighted cigarette blowing a cloud regardless of others' feelings? Choked by the smoke often while having no one to complain to, I seriously agree with the proposal that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is harmful to everyone, no matter he smokes actively or passively. Researches have confirmed the fact that those who smoke are at a higher risk of getting lung cancer than those who don't, and what makes it even more astonishing is that people who breathe the smoke are even more likely to get the disease! So not only does smoking in public areas such as the restaurants harm people who smoke, it also threatens the health of the ignorant people beside them. Besides, smoking can be a potential danger for the public as a cigarette has to be lit when someone smokes which may set the whole restaurant on fire. I'm not creating a great sensation. In fact there was a fire accident in Wenzhou recently resulting from a lit cigarette, causing people getting injured and the restaurant losing a sum of money. There are thousands of such convincing examples pointing out it's dangerous to smoke in public. However, some people may point out that people who smoke knows the disadvantages of smoking, but they simply cannot control themselves, so it's crucial for them not smoking in the restaurants. Admittedly, there are a large number of people used to smoking, and the rule seems to harm their benefits, which is the main reason why the principle is hard to be carried out. A good solution is they can smoke outside the restaurant in the open area. So in conclusion, as the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, I insist smoking being banned in restaurant.
