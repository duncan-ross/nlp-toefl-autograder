College students should have a part-time job or an internship at some time during their university years so that they can learn to organize their time and experience a working environment before entering the working world. Full-time study in the United States starts at 12 units per term, so students who devote the recommended two hours of study for each classroom hour are "students" for 36 hours per week. While heavier course loads can raise that number as high as 60, there is ample time for other activities, both paid and volunteer. Having more activities forces students to organize and budget their time, and these are valuable skills to have upon entering the working world. Part-time jobs are better than volunteer activities at forcing this organization of time. Employers pay their part-timers and depend on them to show up and work, providing a sense of accountability and urgency that volunteer activities do not. Many students graduate, get jobs, and find that they do not know how to do something for eight hours a day, day after day. Work experience is good for teaching students what it is like to put in time, work with other people, deal with real problems, earn money, and pay taxes. Part-time jobs are a fantastic way to introduce students to the realities that await them outside of the university gates in a low-risk environment.
