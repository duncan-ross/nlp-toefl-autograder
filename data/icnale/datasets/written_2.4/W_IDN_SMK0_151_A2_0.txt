Many people in the world are smokers. They still smoking even they know it is a dangerous activity. They smoke everywhere, even at the public facility. I think it should be a rule to be banned the smokers to smoking in a public facility, especially in a restaurant. Restaurant is a place for people to eat, not for smoking. The smokers there will disturb another customer. Maybe they didn't feel it but the others will not feel comfortable with the situation, especially because of the smoke and the smell from their cigarette. They come to the restaurant to enjoy their meal, not for smell the smoke of the cigarette. The other reason to forbidden smoking because the smoke from the cigarette that they made will be inhaled by the other customers. Even the others don't smoking but the smoke that we inhale is very dangerous too. It can make many dangerous diseases that can kill us. On the other hand, the smokers not only make themselves in dangerous situation, but they bring the other people too. The restaurant that doesn't have a rule about smoking will get the bad effect too. For example, some customers may decide wouldn't come to this restaurant again even the food is delicious. Actually, it isn't mistake from the service but because of the customers that smoking, their another customers decided wouldn't come again to their restaurant. It can make they will lose their profits. So, the restaurants must have a rule to forbidden the smokers smoking in their restaurants because smoking will bring the bad effects for the restaurant and their customers.
