Part time jobs for college students are a great idea and can really help them earn some money for; educational fees, daily living expenses and also give them some very useful on the job training experience. Some of the easier jobs for inexperienced students to land include, dish washing, waiting on tables, car wash, packing store shelves as a night clerk or if they are really lucky, working in the same industry or profession that they are going to work in when they graduate. I admit, some of the other jobs may have less appeal, but if students try to keep the big picture in mind and think outside the box, even the less than appealing jobs are great opportunities to start with. Realistically, any job experience looks better on a resume than nothing and it shows that the student was industrious, not afraid to work and was playing an active role in being financial responsible. Finally, even if the job is less than perfect, the student is still able to use this as a stepping stone toward bigger, better and maybe more lucrative opportunities. The reason is simple and I do not have all of the answers as to why, but the fact remains that it is easier to land a new job when you already have a job than it is to get a new job when you don't have a job. Statistics support this so, go figure?
