I think it would be a good idea to ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan because smoking is very dangerous for the health of people. Cigarettes contain many harmful chemicals like tar, rat poison, and nicotine, which is very addictive and makes people want to smoke even more. Nicotine is a drug just like heroin or cocaine and has all of the same characteristics of withdrawal and dependents as the more serious drugs. When you smoke cigarettes, the nicotine makes it very difficult for you to quit even if you want to, and as a result many people find themselves smoking for years and years even though they always want to quit. This may induce a sense of guilt and shame in them, and the additional stress caused by the situation combined with the harmful effects of smoking can have a truly serious affect upon their health. Next, it is very disrespectful to other people in public places like restaurants to smoke because a lot of them do not want to smoke. When people smoke cigarettes in restaurants, other people have to deal with the bad smell and the negative impact upon the taste of the food. In conclusion, banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan would be a very good idea.
