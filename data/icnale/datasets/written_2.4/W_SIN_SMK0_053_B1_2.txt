Being a strong advocator of staying anti smoke-free and one who definitely detests the reek of cigarette smell in my hair, I definitely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Firstly, I always wonder what is behind the rationale of allowing a smoking section, especially in an air-conditioned restaurant. It is of course common knowledge that smell of smoke diffuses and surely do not only stay within the smoking section. While I understand that restaurants are interested in attracting and earning the bucks of even customers who are smokers, it remains absurd as the separation of smokers from non-smokers does not make any difference to people who detest the smell of cigarettes or who suffer from respiratory diseases. Phrased in another way perhaps, I argue that allowing smoking in a restaurant would surely chase non-smoker customers who dislike the smell of cigarettes away. Restaurants with smoking sections are thus strongly encouraged to make a brave switch to the complete banning of smoking in restaurants in order to protect the well-being of a significant proportion of its customers. Singapore has done an excellent job so far, with banning of smoking in air-conditioned places and in public areas near crowded places such as the hawker centres or bus stop etc.
