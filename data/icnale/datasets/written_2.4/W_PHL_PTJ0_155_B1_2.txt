Part-time jobs are widely available nowadays, paving way for people to gain extra income. However, at present, more of the people who apply for part-time jobs are college students. I find such case alarming because for me, we are just students, and it is the job of the parents to support the studies and other education-related expenditures of their children. Should the parents fail, the government should make interventions to be able for the students to finish studies. The government is obviously failing, so what I think is needed is a change in our government. I am strictly against letting students work part time because as a student, I am biased towards my fellow students and it is my belief that at this time in their life, they should be able to find enjoyment in the company of their friends. After all, what will be left for them after their studies are numerous responsibilities that will eat up most of their time, rendering them unable to enjoy most of their lives because of their works. The things they experience at this point in their lives are necessary for their development. All of their curiosity should be satisfied, for if otherwise happens, they might find it hard to accept that their college lives are over without them even enjoying.
