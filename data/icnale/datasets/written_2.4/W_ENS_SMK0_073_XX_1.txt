I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan and I have many reasons for this opinion. First, I think that smoking is very dirty and is very bad for all the people who do it. It would be a nice gift to smokers to give them a good motivation an opportunity to quit smoking, as people who smoke often have a very difficult time quitting on their own due to the addictive effects of nicotine and other chemicals contained within cigarettes. Next, it is not fair to nonsmokers to have to eat in a restaurant that is filled with cigarette smoke because they have to breathe that in and it is worse for their health than it is for the smokers. Secondhand smoke really can kill people, and I did have one friend who grew up in a household in which his parents smoked very heavily, and he had health problems for a long time. Once he moved out of that house, he became much more healthy and vibrant. Smoking is bad for you no matter where you are in the world, so I think that Japan should ban smoking at the restaurants in the same way that the U. S. is beginning to ban smoking at the restaurants here too.
