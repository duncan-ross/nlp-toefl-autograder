I most certainly agree that college students should have a part-time job. However, I do not agree with students using their part-time job as their excuse of poor academic performances. There are various reasons of which I agree with students having a part-time job; however, the main reason is to gain work experience before graduation. As well, I sincerely believe that any person, after age of 18, should sustain their own life. By having a part-time job during a college student's academic life, all reasons above can be established. If a college student graduates without any work experience, they are most likely to have difficulty hunting for a job. If they do succeed in finding a job, students without any work experience will definitely have a very difficult jump start. Therefore, to succeed in a working environment, work experience before graduation is definitely required. I believe after the age of 18, any person should be able to sustain themselves. Although a simple part-time job will not satisfy all the monetary needs of a college student, it will help decrease the amount owing to the bank. By sustaining your own life, a college student will most likely learn to be more responsible and will gain more respect for their parents. Hence, I believe that any college student should, at least sometime during their academic career, have a part-time job.
