I agree because with regard to a student has worked part time while he studies that with may train give he is a person who has the responsibility more and more and will make he knows the saving because he has worked and must make money by oneself then make him knows the value of money more and more. When that person go out for buying, he will think before buying. There are a lot of reasons pop up in his mind in order to make decision before take money out of his bag then give it the sellers. Having part time job is a practical to make someone being systematically because he will manage time table from school as well as time table from workplaces. It is hard to find individual students who can be successful in both areas in the same time because it is hard to do. In university, there are a lot of activities, and homework to do, although on weekend lots of them have to go to university in order to do the reports or group work with friends. There are very less time for having part time job. It is possible to have part time job, and I support that but the obstacle for college students is time available. So if a student who want to have part time job should do when he's free.
