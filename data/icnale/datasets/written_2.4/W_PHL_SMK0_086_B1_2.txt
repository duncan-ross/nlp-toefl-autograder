Smoking at public places seems to be a prevalent problem in the country nowadays. It might be relaxing for some people but they could be irritating for some. Well, I join the latter's side. In any angle, smoking is dangerous to the health of everyone. Though it may keep you stress-free for some time, it will surely poison you little by little, gradually. Plus, a cigarette stick contains substances that are considered toxic. For instance, it contains DDT, a main component of pesticide. We're humans and not pesticides, aren't we? More to that, it contains a substance called nicotine, the main reason why smokers get addicted to it. Now, the question arises. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? If my opinion would be asked, my answer would be a big YES. My argument is that smoking releases toxic particulates that are not visible to the naked eye. These particulates will be suspended in the air. In time, these would settle and the food eaten by customers would be affected. Also, second-hand smokers are more vulnerable to the ill effects of smoking. This is why some patients suffering from lung cancer or emphysema seem to be alarmed with how they got the disease when they themselves never even smoked. I have a firm stand in this issue. After all, smoking in public places is already prohibited. It's just that it is human nature to oppose authority.
