 As is known to all, nowadays more and more college students do part time jobs frequently, bearing all kinds of thoughts. We can look at every aspect of the phenomenon: As to the college students especially undergraduate students, studying and caring about their own courses is the most important thing. It isn't an ideal social practice for the students in that long time will be taken and part time job will set obstacles of concentrating themselves on the study which should be their own profession. As to the society, it may be good since the competitive atmosphere in the recruitment markets can thus be motivated. As a consequence, we can offer more opportunity for the college students to help them prepare themselves for the working period. As to the college, the phenomenon reveals the fact that some courses involving social practicing and starting a career should come out. Both society and students need them to create more thinking about the real world. In a nutshell, it isn't a yes-no question but a complex phenomenon that reveals a lot of potential problems of our mode of college education. Some students really need earn their living while some just want to practice their thoughts on the real jobs in the society. Anyway, it depends on personal situation to judge the reasonability.
