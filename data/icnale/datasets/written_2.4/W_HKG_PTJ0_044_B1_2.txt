Nowadays, with the evolution of education system, more and more students can get into a university for advanced study. Most of them do not take study as a full-time job. They usually have a part-time job as the schedule of university is somehow flexible. Here comes the question, is it important for them to have a part-time job? From my point of view, having a part-time job is not important to us. First of all, having a part-time job exploit students' study time. A part-time job usually takes several hours or a whole day. The time for revision and study will be reduced, normal students' will need more time and energy to catch up. Therefore, current studies will be hindered. Besides, having a part-time job is not as good as participating in internships or mentoring program. Part-time jobs that university students have are usually tutorial class or sales, which cannot grant them experience in doing specialized job like banker, manager, etc. While the latter can definitely grant students a valuable experience in different areas like inter-personal communication skills. Therefore, it is totally a waste of time to have a part-time job. Lastly, having a part-time job may create more stress to students. This is simply because of the job requirement. Students' workload will then be heavier as they need to face the challenge in school and working. This will absolutely create a burden to them, affecting their overall performance in all areas.
