Since health problem is much more concerned than in the past, to protect our right to be healthier is everyone's duty. It has been proved that smoking is harmful to our health, and even others'. As the result, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As record showed, there are about 1. 3 million people died from lung cancer, which may caused by smoke and second-hand smoke. Restaurants are opened for everyone, which means that everyone could go to. Though one may complain that they have rights not to be restricted by others, it is really selfish if we ignore others right in public. Second-hand smoke would pollute other guests' dishes, clothing, and that is very impolite. We all want to have a pleasant environment to have meals; the only way to achieve this target is to understand that every single person has the same right as we do. Further we will never want to be the one harm our family, so does other. If we smoke in the public, we could probably not only make other unpleasant but harm other's health. If we can not to smoke in front our pregnant family, it is really nothing to die out the cigarettes in our hands. For everyone's health, I agree that all the restaurants in the country should prohibit smoking.
