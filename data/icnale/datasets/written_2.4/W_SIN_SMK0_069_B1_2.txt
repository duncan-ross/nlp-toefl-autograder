I agree to this statement to a large extent. The harmful effects of smoking have been pronounced significantly and non smokers should not be bearing such ill effects while dining in the local restaurants. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. There are situations in which smoking can be allowed in restaurants. For example, some restaurants have cordoned off a certain area, usually outdoors, just to cater to smokers and this separation allows smokers to have their meals while smoking, while the rest can have their meals away from the smokers in the air-conditioned settings. On the other hand, smoking actually produces second hand smoke which can be extremely uncomfortable to non smokers. Therefore, since the purpose of restaurants is to provide customers with a nice environment to consume their meals, smoking should not be allowed as it causes discomfort to those who are dining. In addition, there are alternative places in which smokers can take a puff in the midst having a meal. They can move away from the restaurant and return after they have finished smoking. These alternatives provide a case where smoking should be banned in restaurants, since the non smokers would benefit that there are no smokers to disturb their meals while smokers are still able to smoke, albeit away from their meals.
