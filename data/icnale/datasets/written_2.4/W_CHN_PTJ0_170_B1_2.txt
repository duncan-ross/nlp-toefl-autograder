As the saying goes, when we enter the college, this means that we are entering the society. So when we are in the college, not only we should learn knowledge, but also we should take part-time jobs. In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons. Firstly, we go to school to gain knowledge, but we seldom have the chance to put it into practice. But in the college, we have our own time, we meet more people, then we have more chances. So having a part-time job makes it possible to put what we have learned into practice. Secondly, taking a part-time job is a way to experience our life. It can tell us we are not children any more. We should do things on our own. Thirdly, we can accumulate social experience and learn more social knowledge to make ourselves more quickly to adapt to the future society. What's more, we can add a little to our cost of living. In addition, when we find a job, we should be careful in case of being treated. Above all, I think it is important for college students to take a part-time job.
