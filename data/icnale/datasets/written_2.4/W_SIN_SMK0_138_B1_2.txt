I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, other than bringing personal pleasure and providing socialization opportunities, smoking has no other benefits especially in terms of health. In fact, it is a health hazard as it poses as a risk factor for many other diseases, acute or chronic. For instance, it primarily affects the lungs, in which puts an individual at risk for developing respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Smoking does not only affect the health of the smoking individual, but also the other patrons of the restaurant through passive smoking. Furthermore, smoking should be banned at all restaurants because its smell may not be pleasant to non-smoker patrons, especially those who are health-conscious. It is just like the strong smell of durian which is appealing to people who enjoy consuming it but may be unacceptable to people who have never tasted it. On top of these reasons, thrown-away cigarettes that remained lit could result in a fire outbreak in restaurants, hence smoking should be completely banned at all of the food places. In a nutshell, smoking is a health hazard and also a fire hazard, it should not be allowed at all restaurants in the country.
