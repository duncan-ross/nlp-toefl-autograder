I don't have much experience in part-time job, because I want to concentrate on studying. I had a part-time job when I was a junior school student. The job is my classmate introduces me, and the job is to call students and ask them whether want to cram school. It seems very easy, but not at all. Some people heard the phone from cram school they will check out the phone, it make me sad and disappoint. But I want to earn money by myself, I never give up until I have to prepare second exam. From that experience, I learn something about how to talk with strangers and introduce cram school's subject to them, even if someone checks out my phone. It's my first experience and I believe I will have second time and more experience in part time job. I will learn more things from that. I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job, because we can learn how to talk and tough with each others. But the most important thing is studying, if the part-time jobs influence your subjects. You will get a big trouble; even you will be flunk in many subjects.
