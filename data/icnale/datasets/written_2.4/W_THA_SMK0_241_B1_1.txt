I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in country. Because the restaurant is a public place that many people goes there. If there is someone or anyone smoking at the restaurant or anywhere else the smoke will harm the people who don't smoke too so that is an interruption to others. Because is not only does smoking hurt the person who is smoking, but recent scientific and medical shows that the dangers associated with second hand smoking For the smoke from cigarette it's too bad for child, pregnant women and everyone. If you sniff to the smoke for many times you might be at risk to get a lung cancer or many diseases. In some country might be ignored for this problem and think that it is a commonly to smoke! I think there should be a strong punishment for anyone who smoking in the restaurant or any public places such as smoking in hospitals, hotel, school and airports. There should be a strongly legal to manage the smokers to realize that "where" or "when" that they can smoke, not everywhere every time like these day. In general, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision as to whether to smoke or not should be for each individual to make.
