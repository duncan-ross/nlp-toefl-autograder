There is a general belief that a university student should have a part-time job in their studying period. This belief has been widespread continuously over every university in each year and the importance of having a part-time job has been cultivated into the freshman mind when they just come into university. Students who have a part-time job may gain experience and money but it is not crucial in university life. Having a part-time job may disrupt studying in the university. Part-time job occupy a slot in student's timetable and probably student may give up their learning chance if they have a part-time job. It is clear to understand that a university student should rank their studying into the first priority. Tertiary education provides full skills and knowledge in a particular area and therefore educates student to suit for that particular area. It could be a shame if student was not well-equipped in their field because they have used their time to work in a part-time job rather than learning. The fundamental basis is that a part-time job should not disrupt university learning. There is no point to comment on the importance of a part-time job if a student cannot strike a balance. Therefore if student can handle it very well, it turns to be useful.
