I agree with this idea. I have some reasons why I say so. First, It is difficult for most student who live alone to enjoy by using only money that their parents give them monthly. As for me, I live alone now, and use that money for shopping food, commodity, texts, and a house rent. I need money to play with my friends and buy what I want. Second, we will get precious experience by working for a part time job. I don't know what we will get because I have never worked, but all my friends who have worked so far say that working is very important for growing up because we can experience something we have never expected, and we can make a living by ourselves. Third, we can make friends with many people. Of course, we need making friends at our college but we also need some friends out of college to enjoy living. I think that the friendship will be very precious thing. These three reasons make me agree with this assignment's theme. Now, I don't work at anywhere but I think strongly that I must work. If I work at where I think it suits for me and get precious experience, I want to use the experience to grow up.
