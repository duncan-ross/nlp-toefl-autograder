We all know that smoking is very dangerous to our health. Do you know that Secondhand smoke is three times more harmful? It is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous to people with pre-existing conditions. According to research, many countries have already banned smoking in public places like malls and restaurants. That action gave good effects to the health of the citizens of their country. Here in the Philippines, I think we should also ban smoking in places like restaurants. There are several reasons why we need to forbid smoking. First, Secondhand smoke in an indoor area has higher concentration than outdoors. Indoor areas with smokers might suffocate other non smokers. Many people might complain if that happens. Second, it may lead to serious diseases like asthma, bronchitis, cancer, emphysema, etc. Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke leads to long-term ill health effects. Many store owners agreed to ban smoking because they want to protect the health of their customers and employees. Even though, it might have a bad effect to their profit, the physical condition of the people should be their main concern. Their customers with pre-existing conditions might deteriorate their diseases and lead to unwanted results. Third, it encourages other people to quit smoking. Many people enjoy smoking while eating and drinking liquors, if the restaurant forbids smoking, they will be force to stop their habit until they finish eating. Banning smoking in a small public place is a stepping stone towards bigger and greater purpose. If all customers, employees and store owners cooperate and participate to this agenda, lesser people will use cigarette. And lesser smokers will lead to lesser harmful diseases. So let's spread the good news to other people. Ban smoking and have a healthy lifestyle.
