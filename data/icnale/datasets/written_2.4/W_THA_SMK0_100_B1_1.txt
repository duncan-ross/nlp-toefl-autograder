I agree with the state Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Since a cigarette is a substance that is bad for the body. It has very bad smell and toxic smoke when it was fired and the smoke will diffuse all of the place, for example, if you smoke in your bedroom, the smog is going to distribute around the room. The cigarette is not only bad for a smoker but also for the people that are around him because it had released carbon monoxide (CO), tar and nicotine which contain in the cigar during it was fired and these are very harmful to the lungs of smoker and nearby people. In case of the restaurant where people go to have in each meals. This place must be clean (no pollution), has beautiful views, is attractive etc. So if the some consumer smoked in the restaurant, it will cause the impurity in food because of the toxic smoke from the cigar. and this restaurant may be banned. To solve this problem, the owner should post No smoking tag in front of yours and if someone resist this command, he must be fined. Moreover you may divide the place for smoking and mustn't disturb the others.
