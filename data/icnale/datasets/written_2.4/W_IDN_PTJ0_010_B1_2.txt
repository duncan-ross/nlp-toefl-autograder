I am agree education cannot be separated from human life. From the moment we are born, we have got education. Based on Juhn Dewey, education is one of the renewal process the meaning of experience. This process involves the supervision and development of minors and the group where he lived. In addition to getting education from the family, over time we need a formal education. From here, the importance of schools and colleges as a means to help realize the creation of quality human resources. From formal education, the student will get a lot of knowledge from all fields. During in education student will gain knowledge in accordance with the talent, achievements and skills practiced. The theory gained from education would be more useful if put into practice immediately in the workplace. With so theory and practice in the field balanced. In theory lectures will be obtained, then applied in practiced. Students need to find a part time job in addition to his education. To get both, students must be clever in managing the time between academic achievement with the part time job. By sharing a good time, they will walk in balance. Even better if the job in accordance with part time job discipline practiced. I strongly agree with the statement which stated that a student is important to have a part time job. From there someone will get experience in the practice in the field. Students also will be able to apply theory learned from school. With two events running simultaneously, which will help students practice in managing time. Person's ability to manage time will bring success in life, because time is key achieve success.
