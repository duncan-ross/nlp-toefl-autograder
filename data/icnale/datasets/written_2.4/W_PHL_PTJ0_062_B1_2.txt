College Students Should Have Part-Time Job Do you agree or disagree that college students should do part time job? Most students are motivated to work in some reasons. I believe that part time job is beneficial for students despite some people who argue that students should not do part time job because their main duty is studying. In my opinion, I personally think that college students can work part time but not mainly for money. They need to have some experiences for their future career. If they have good experiences, they will have good opportunity to get job when they finish their education. They may study and at the same time may work to lessen the burdens of their parents. Nowadays, a large number of students choose to have a part-time job in their spare time. Surely, a part time job can provide cash and working experience to them. Another benefit of having a job is it builds character in oneself. It also allows students to get a sense of independence as they are not always relying on their parents to give them money. Part time job lets the students appreciate money that they earn from their job. They will eventually learn not to waste money for something that gives no meaning. It lets them build and realize their dreams as they have started earning on their own. In summary, perhaps many people will think that having a part time job may affect their studies, but I really think that this job can help college students ' future become much better. Part time job may sound beneficial as long as it wouldn't hinder the focus of students on studying.
