I think this would be right and would say that I agree wholeheartedly because of the uncertainty of the market and the current economic climate. While it is all well and good to go to college and get a degree, there are many unemployed MBA and PhD out there who are struggling to get the kind of work that they trained for. By having as many part-time jobs or as much real job experience as they can get, students would have more options after graduation. There have been numerous cases were people have changed careers or been able to get jobs that they needed that were not related to their degree when times were tough. They were able to do this because they had a variety of experiences had a desperate need to get a job and were willing and able to fall back on skills gained previously. To me, this would be a smart strategy to keep in mind because students don't always commence a new job as soon as they graduate and may have to wait some time before getting their dream job. At least this way, they would have a better shot at getting other kinds of work to keep them going and pay the bills.
