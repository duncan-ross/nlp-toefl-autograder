I am in favor of the topic that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons are as follows. First, nowadays many college students have little knowledge on social-living skills during to the one-child policy, so even though they are riched in textbook knowledge they won't adjust to the real future society. Part-time job is a good choice to solve it, it can teach them how to deal with various problems when they are working with others. Second, during part-time job, students will work on their on their own and be paid according to how much they have done, so they will understand how hard money comes and be more grateful for what they have. Third, on the period of working, college students will make known of many people, they work together, eat together and may even play toghther, they will achieve more happiness during working and their lives will be enriched. Part-time jobs have a lot of advantages that be good for us students. However, part-time job isn't the only way that can achieve these. We students can take more activities, join more organizations and do more meaningful things. On this way, I believe we college students will have a bright future.
