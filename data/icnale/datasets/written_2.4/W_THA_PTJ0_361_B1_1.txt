I think it is important more for college students to have a part-time job because if I finish study. I will have experience for career and meet many people. I will have money for reserve to spend everything when I have not money. It makes me grow up and many responsibility. I think my parents are proud of myself that I can do many things by myself moreover it gives me confident when I find work. Don't shy to presentation to people when I am work. It makes me ask questions that "Have you ever worked when you studied in college?" It makes me spend time to be useful and do everything by myself. It makes me proud. But sometimes I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it might make me do not have time for to do homework. Review exercises or read books. And it might me sleep less. Don't understand when teacher teach me or sleepy in classes. And it might me send homework not on time. It might makes me tired and don't have time to do activities at University. So I think a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages.
