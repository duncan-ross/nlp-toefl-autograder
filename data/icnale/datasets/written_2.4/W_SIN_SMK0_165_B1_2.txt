 In Singapore, there are smoking areas and non-smoking areas clearly mapped out in many public places, such as in coffee shops, clubs, and restaurants. This was part of the latest initiative pushed out by the government in order to curb smoking in Singapore. In this essay, I argue that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore and I will be providing two main arguments to support my stand. Firstly, in banning smoking at all restaurants in Singapore, it can be seen that certain rights of these smokers are taken away from them. Although the adverse effects of smoking and second-hand smoke had been fully advocated by the state, it would be unfair to these smokers to take away the space for them to smoke at certain places (i. e. restaurants). Another reason that I proposed is that if the state were to ban smoking at all restaurants in Singapore, this would quickly expand to all public places in Singapore. This would leave smokers with no place to go and law enforcement of such measures would also take a toll on the law enforcement officers. In conclusion, it would be infringement on the basic rights of smokers if such measures were enforced, and that the law enforcement would definitely lag behind such measures which in turns take a toll on law enforcement officers.
