It is estimated that the tax of cigarette will be increased in Hong Kong in order to ban smoking. Some suggest a stronger way, which is banning smoking in all restaurants. Nevertheless, I think there is no reason to execute this action. The reason is simple. They have their right to smoke and they do not violate the law. The argument of this proposal is that it is not enough for the restaurants to provide smoking and non-smoking area for the public since the air system cannot be guaranteed. But it is only the matter of the restaurants and not the smokers themselves. We should regulate the restaurants. You can choose not to enter into the smoking area if you are afraid of your health. So far, smoking in smoking area is not illegal. Thus, smokers can still have their right to smoke in appropriate area. Take an example; it is common that some seafood and vegetable contain little toxic compounds. But, we see that most of us will still buy them. Here, you have the right to choose. Can we forbid you not to buy them? Therefore, we should not interfere the smoker's right if they abide by the law.
