To a certain extent I agree. By that I mean that if college students are receiving some form of scholarship or their fees are being paid by means other than their immediate family, then I think that they should shoulder some of the responsibility and give something back rather than just accept a handout for free. It helps build character, lightens the financial burden of those paying and teaches them that you can't get everything for free without giving something back in exchange. It's called fair exchange and the earlier in life that college students learn this, they will be better off in the long term. On the other hand, if students are paying their own way or their tuition is being paid for by their family, then I believe that they should devote as much time to their learning as possible without being weighed down by extra commitments. I believed that they have earned that right by having the means to pay their way, even if that is through the assistance of their family. I believe that this is still fair exchange in that either the family or the student were prepared financially for college and therefore, it is not necessary for them to have a part time job unless it is by free choice and perhaps related to the career that they are pursuing.
