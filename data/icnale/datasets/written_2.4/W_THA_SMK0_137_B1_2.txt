I'm strongly agreed with this subject. Not only in the restaurant and country but also in the world too. Because the cigarette is do not have any benefit. In addition, it can make our life very down and sick too. Smoking in restaurant and in the country or the place where the people still that is a very bad thing. Not only the person who smoke will have the danger but the people who stay around him also. A cigarette can make them to be a danger because it has a lot of things to can make them die. If they smoke it for a long time or the people still in area that have a cigarette smoke, they can have a big problem that is be sick such as cancer. Moreover, the cancer doesn't have any treatment. In the finally, they may die. To conclude, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it does not have any advantages. However, the person who still smokes the cigarette should smoke in the area where they can smoke and should not harm another person who doesn't smoke. If it can be clear, that will make our world to be fresh more than now. At least, that will able to reduce the number of patients too.
