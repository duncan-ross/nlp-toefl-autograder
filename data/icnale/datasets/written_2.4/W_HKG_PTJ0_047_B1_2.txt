There are much more free time for university students when comparing with their time in high school. The free time should be used for them to have self-study. Some of the students would use those time for a part-time job. Whether university students should use free time for part-time job is a time for debate. Personally, I strongly believe that university students should use a part of the free time for part-time job. There are numerous reasons why I hold this point and I would express the most important ones here. To begin with, there is perhaps nothing more important to get some practical working experience in their university life. The aim of studies in university is to prepare for the work in future. Therefore, practical work should be a part of studies in university. If the student doesn't get any practical working experience after the university studies, no employer would employ them. As a result, it is advisable for them to get the practical working experience from the part-time job. To conclude, having a part-time job is essential for a university students and I hope all students can get the most suitable part-job for them.
