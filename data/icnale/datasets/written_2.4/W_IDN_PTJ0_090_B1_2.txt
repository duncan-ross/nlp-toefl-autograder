I think part time job is important for adult and university student. Part time job give many benefits for people or for students. If we have part time job, we can learn about how difficult to get money. So, we can appreciate our effort to get money and don't waste much money for something that not important or useless. For example, like buy some new clothes, new accessories, new bags, go to salon and so on. Women like to buy things like that, although not necessary, but if we already feel how precious we are seeking our own money, then we will save the money for something more is needed or useful, such as college tuition or future saving. In addition, not only get money, but also life experiences that might be useful someday. Another benefit of working part time is that we can become independent students. Students who not only beg for money from their parents. So that, we will get used to attempt our own money and not dependent on our parents because in the end, we will have our own family. There will be a benefit that is felt by our parents. They will be proud and appreciate our action, provided that part-time job that we take is not bad for such jobs that endanger our lives, moral damage, interfere with our study, interfering with other people, too risky, and the jobs that are not feasible or unhealthy. Finally, we can consider and know some of the benefits that we will get if we want to try to think mature and willing to make our own way without depending on the parents only. However, we need to know also the permission of our parents is a very important element and our readiness to work.
