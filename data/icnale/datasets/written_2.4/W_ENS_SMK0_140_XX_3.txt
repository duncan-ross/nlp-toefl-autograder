I am not trying to forbid smokers from smoking anywhere. I just agree that there should be limits to where they can smoke so that it doesn't affect the health of others. It has been proven that passive smokers, breathing in the smoke exhaled by smokers, are then put in the same danger that smokers are health wise. Smoking in Japan's public places is really becoming a serious issue and needs to be dealt with swiftly. Everybody has the right to live in a healthy manner and though smokers have the right to smoke, that doesn't mean that they should be allowed to put others in danger. This is exactly what they do when they walk down the street smoking and the people walking behind them end up inhaling the smoke as well and it is the same in Japanese restaurants where the division of smoking and non-smoking sections is an absolute joke and totally meaningless as well as completely ineffective. I think that if there were a lot more smoking related lawsuits against restaurant owners, we would see some changes quick smart. Until that happens, it is up to Japan's government to do something meaningful to minimize the danger.
