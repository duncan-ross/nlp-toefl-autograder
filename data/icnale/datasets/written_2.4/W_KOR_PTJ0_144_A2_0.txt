I find that it is very important for students to look for a part time job in school, because it can give you a lot exercise and you can get a lot of success from that, not just money but friends, you can do something better when you do part time job, friends is the best way when you do something, If you get hard you can ask help from them no matter where you are, no matter what will you do, no matter who you are, this is a very unforgettable value you own, if you are old you can think about that time you do these things, you can find it is very beautiful, now parents is very hard to do the job and for our family, so do part time job is a good way to do something to relax and help our family. Many people think it is unusual to do a part time job, they play games or shopping in the stores, waste of time and waste of money, ran money is hard but waste of money is easy, many people is poor because they do not work hard and they have no sign in their life ways, in your life you have many chance and you have many choice, if you lost it, perhaps, it is forever. So you must do something what you believe it.
