In recent years, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study. Should we put the blame on part-time jobs? Is it a good thing for college students to work part time? I think we need to think about this question carefully from different sides. It is true that excellent academic: qualifications are something essential if you want to find a good job after you leave school. But on the other hand, for those who can easily get high marks in examinations, it is worth trying to find something to do in their spare time. Then they can get some work experience which is as valuable as their academic achievement. From what I have said, it is difficult to judge whether taking part time jobs is good or bad. It depends on how you deal with the relationship between working and learning. If you can balance it well, you are sure to get enough knowledge as well as working experience, so as to get ready for you future success. So we can just say that doing part-time job can be good for some people and not so good for others. It just depends on your situations.
