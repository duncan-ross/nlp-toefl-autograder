Some people object to the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They think that campus activity is important for college students. They say that you have a part time job whenever you want but campus activity is now or never. I disagree with a point of view because I think it has many benefits to have a part time job for college students. There are two reasons. Firstly, you can get chance to experience job in advance through part time job. After graduation, you will want to have a work in company. If you do not have a part time job during college life, you may be hard to find a job because you do not know that the work suits you. However, if you experience job in advance through part time job, you can know well the job and will check that the job fits you. As a result, you can successfully find a job. Secondly, you will learn how to use money wisely. When you got an allowance from your parents, you would not know how to use money wisely because you did not earn your own money. Though, if you earn money through part time job, you will realize importance of the money and you will be conservative in spending money. In this way that part time job will be help to experience job in advance and learn how to use money wisely, I think it is important to get a part-time job during college life.
