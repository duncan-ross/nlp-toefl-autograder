I think it's should not allow smoking at all restaurants in the country. But it can smoke on the attic or outside area. Smoke in the public area is unfair to the non-smoke people, and it affects the dining atmosphere. For a non-smoker, the smoke is not good to smell, and some people allergy at it. In the restaurant, there are many kinds of people, unusual, like child, baby, and pregnant woman. They are unsuitable to smell the smoke, because it will harm their health and affect grow. Then, the restaurant atmosphere, actuality the smoke smell is bad, and most people smell the smoke they feel unhappy and want to leave. To the smoking people, they will argue that it's unfair to their human right. So we have to give them a place to smoke, like roof, outside, a stateroom and so on. The area they can smoke but not bother their people, I think it's a way to solve this problem. If it has to ban the smoke in the restaurant, there should have some rules. And there has some problems, the first one is when some people don't follow the rule, what should we do? And how to propaganda and let people agree this rule? I think it's the questions to the executor. All in all, I strong suggest people do not smoke in the restaurant or any public area, there are too many disadvantage to smoke.
