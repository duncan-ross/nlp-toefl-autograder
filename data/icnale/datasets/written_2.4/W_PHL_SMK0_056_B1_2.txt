Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy your meal because of the smoke coming from the table of others. Banning smoking in public places should be completely done by the government. Banning smoking in public places isn't just a question of taking away one group's freedom for the benefit of another; it is something that is in the interest of people as a whole. It comes down to a decision between the health of a whole nation versus the freedom of a minority. Arguably by allowing smoking in public places it is the freedom of non-smokers that is being restricted because second hand smoking is more dangerous. Second hand smoking increases the risk of heart attack and heart disease. The only effective way to avoid the effects of second hand smoke is to insist on a smoke-free environment. In response to it smoker's and non-smoker's choice shows that everyone is being affected by smoking being banned in public places like restaurants. During the course of the meal a cloud of smoke is now no longer a bother. Because there are now designated areas for smokers and non-smokers someone could enjoy a meal without being uncomfortable. At the same time, a smoker is made uncomfortable because the restaurant is a non-smoking facility. Only the non-smoker can be completely satisfied. Is that fair in a free nation? If public places would compromise and designate certain areas for smoking and non-smoking then maybe everyone could be in a public area and be comfortable or satisfied.
