First of all, smoking is bad for your health and others. What more if there are people around you, consuming their own food and are exposed to your second-hand smoke? Smoking can go into people's food, thus intoxicating their food with second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke in the other hand, is more dangerous than inhaling and exhaling your own smoke. This could lead other customers to not enjoy the environment and not like what they are eating. Especially to customers that have asthma and people who really hate smoke. Smoking inside a restaurant is not the right place. If you really can't stop yourself, you can smoke in a filtered room or a smoking area. Smoking is not good for anybody. It can reduce your lifespan for minutes, hours, or even days. If you want to abuse yourself for it, might as well do it in a place where you cannot affect anybody. You can damage the lungs of older people with lung problems and even children. You might even influence younger children if you smoke in restaurants because they might think it is okay to do so. If you are to smoke in a restaurant, you must be aware and considerate of other people who want to eat and have a good time. Might as well do it somewhere else or not smoke at all.
