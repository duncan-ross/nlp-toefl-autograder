A part-time job can help a student to learn many skills I will be valuable in their future. As such, it is a great way to invest their time especially for the enormous rewards that you can gain in the future. For example, if you can find work related to your major such as at internships or a local company, you'll have a huge advantage over the other college graduates who graduate with little to no work experience. Real world experience combined with a college degree is a very deadly combination, and the more students can do to effect this kind of outcome from their college experience, the more strong and prosperous our industry and economy will grow. I maybe somewhat visionary in expressing my ideas in this manner, but I don't feel that it is appropriate for students to spend all of their time goofing off and not spend enough time investing in their own futures. The financial gains that stand to be made by being diligent and hardworking in college as well as in a part-time job are plenty of incentive for students to take it seriously, and in conclusion, college student should have a part-time job.
