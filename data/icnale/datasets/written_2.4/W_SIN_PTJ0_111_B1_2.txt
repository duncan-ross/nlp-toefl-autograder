I feel that college students should not get a part time job unless necessary. It is often argued that getting a part time job would not only allow one to support his oneself and earn some extra pocket money, but it would also provide other externalities such as teach one about time management and gain additional experience. Yet I feel these benefits far outweigh the costs. College students already have a very full plate with all their academic commitments. With the additional load of a part time job, students would have less time to do their revision. Even if they do manage to strike a balance, it is unlikely that he would have any time to pursue his own hobbies. In fact, in our Asian society, parents too would often argue that whatever free time available should be spent studying to improve one's grades, so as to position oneself better in the future. Instead, I feel if one were to advocate that students do more than study, they should instead be encouraged to enrol in extracurricular activities, perhaps in school. These activities, while not helping them financially, would instead be more beneficial as it would allow them to have a more holistic college life, as well as possibly providing access to social capital in school due to the additional contacts being made. Perhaps the only reason why they should get a side job would be if they households are facing financial difficulties and a job would therefore go some distance in alleviating the situation. Yet this argument has holes in it since scholarships and bursaries are widely available to cushion the financial burden of education. As such, I feel that college students should be just that, college students who are focused on their academic commitments rather than working part time.
