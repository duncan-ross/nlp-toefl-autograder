I agree with the opinion, but I want to change the words in Japan to in the world. And I have three reasons why I choose this. First, by smoking, we can not find the taste of food well, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him can not find the taste of food well. So if we appreciate the fact that we can eat food, we should not smoke in the restaurant. Second, smoking is bad for health, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him are made bad impact from him. Especially, smoke which other people take in is worse than smoke which person who smoke directly take in, and people who take in smoke which is from smoking person is likely to be lung cancer. So people who smoke should stop to smoke before other people say to you I wish you stop to smoke. Third, in the place where many people gather, there may be a person who do not like cigarette, so people who smoke should stop to smoke to make a good mood. Consequently, I agree with this opinion. But I say again, the words in Japan should change to in the world.
