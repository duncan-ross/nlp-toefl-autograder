No, smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in Singapore. I believe that banning smoking from all restaurants will make smokers really unhappy as there are already many places that smokers cannot smoke at such as shopping centers. If they really implement the law stating that no smoking at all restaurants, where will the smokers be able to smoke? Besides, the laws and fines about smoking in singapore are already very severe and the fines given are very expensive as well. Most of all, singaporeans that smoke have learnt to respect non smokers by not smoking near them or they smoke at the places that allow smoking at coffee shops. And if they smoked in the area where smoking is prohibited, if you ask them politely they will apologize and go to the non smoking area. So why implement more laws to ban smoking? Smokers have their own rights as well and as long as they follow the laws in singapore, banning smoking in restaurants is not needed. If smoking were to really be banned in Singapore, I personally believe that it may lead to protests or even riots and it would mean spending more money and time to manage such conflicts. Personally i'm not a smoker myself, but my friends are smokers. And from what I see from them, they behave very well in public when smoking and they do not smoke when they are at restaurants. Therefore I do not agree that smoking should be banned in the restaurants in singapore,
