 Smoking, one of the most efficient health chronic killers in 21st century, is nowadays drawing more and more people's attention. As is known to all, smoking is the source of many kinds of diseases, such as heavily coughing \asthma and lung cancer. It does great harm to human body, especially for newly-born babies. It's recently reported that a bowl of boiled water with butt is enough to put a baby to death. Moreover, it is also harmful to the surroundings when smoking in public. Cigarettes give off poisonous gas into the air, not only affecting the plants nearby, but also harming non-smokers around. Cigarettes have an even greater bad impact on passive smokers. Accordingly, many non-smokers are against smoking. Governments are putting up a ban on smoking in public places. It is a measure to protect our health and the environment. But many smokers argue that this action strips them of freedom. They have the right to do what they like. It is lame, isn't it? Non-smokers have the right to breathe in fresh air which smokers are about to pollute instead. If must, smokers need a private room to separate the smoke from the public. And they still have the freedom. As far as I am concerned, giving up smoking is the best beneficial decision you make. It is good to all of us.
