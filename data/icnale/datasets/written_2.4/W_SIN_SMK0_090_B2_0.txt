I agree with this statement completely. Although detractors may argue that the sale of cigarettes brings a boost to the economy and gives many jobs to people living in third-world nations, the vices of smoking severely outweigh the benefits that it brings. Smoking not only harms the smoker, but also anybody in the vicinity of the smoker. Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country so that non-smokers do not have to suffer the numerous adverse dire consequences of smoking, such as lung cancer and liver diseases. Non-smokers should not have to suffer the injustice of bearing the consequences of another person's actions. It would be extremely inconsiderate of smokers to think that since smoking has not done any serious harm to them yet, the smoke will most likely not cause health problems for the chain smokers. This is because the effects of smoking have repeatedly been proven by many scientific studies to be negative ones. Currently, some restaurants have an enclosed "smoker's corner" to cater to the smoking crowd. However, this does not eliminate the chance that any non-smoking waiters or waitresses could be asked to enter that room to serve food. Therefore, to boost the overall health of our country, and to prevent non-smokers from suffering the consequences of inhaling second-hand smoke, we should discourage smoking by banning it in restaurants.
