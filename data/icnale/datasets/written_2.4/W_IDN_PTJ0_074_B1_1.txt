Working will get the money as the income, and later that money will be use for buy some needs. Every people certainly want to get a job. Include the college student. But, I disagree with a statements that say even it is important for college students have a part – time job. Because, I think part time job isn't the main thing that college students must be doing. The important thing for college students are study well, and later will get a great achievement. If the college students have a part time job, because they want to help the family economic problem, so they can pay the college fee with own income, or they want to get more a pocket money for buy a college needs, it is not banned. But, there are another way to get a money, if use for that reason. It is scholarship. All of college student can get it, but they must be good students. In part time job, they just working a few hours in a day. So if in the morning they study at college, then in the evening or when they go back from college, they start for working. And certainly they will feel proud because they can get the money from himself. But, part time job for college student have the negative effect, it is they will lost more time for study at home, or doing their college task. Because when they go back from their part time job, they will feel so tired, then they go to sleep without study. So, part time job can decrease a time for study and their achievement. But nothing problem if the college students have a part time job if they can manage the time well, they work but still diligent for study.
