I think that most people in Taiwan are not smoking, but if a person smoke in a public place, all people around the person would like they are smoking, too, cause the smell would flow in the air, people have no choice but to accept the person who is smoking. Sometimes I think that is unfair, and may ask: why should I accept? In my opinion, it's important that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, because all people are not like to be disturbed, like me. If I am eating in a restaurant, I might be angry because some people are smoking and let me feel difficult to breathe. A restaurant maybe good or bad, but it should clearly let everyone know if people can smoke at this restaurant, and those who can accept people smoking will enter the restaurant, those who can't will leave. This is still a problem, and it is about all people live in the country, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, but there are other problems need to solve. If people can accept, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, because for more people clean air is important, but for those who need smoke it may still a question.
