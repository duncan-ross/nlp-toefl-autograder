I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, I don't think that it should be completely banned. Of course, smoke has so bad effect on not only those who enjoy smoking directly but also people who receive indirectly and without their will, in short, smoking has no benefit, but there are a lot of people who are addicted to smoke, so it is too difficult to forbid to smoke suddenly and completely. My friend's husband died 61 years old because of lung cancer. He was heavy smoker. He smoked always in his house, his office, and even during diets. His doctor advised him not to smoke any more, or he would die of sick, lung cancer. In spite of this advice, he was smoking every day. Though he understood to give up smoking, he couldn't stop it. I have watched the TV about many kinds of cancers. I was very surprised to see a lung invaded owing to smoking. It was miserable and I thought that I didn't want to face to such a situation. Smoking is a kind of drag and should not be used, so, ideally, it ought to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, however it is difficult. Therefore, we may partly ban to smoke.
