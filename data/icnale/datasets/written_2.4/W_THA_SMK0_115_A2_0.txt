I agree in Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is very dangerous. Smoking in public such as, cinema, park is inappropriate because smoking is danger to smoker and people around smoker. Smoking is one types in Narcotic. I think the government must have smoking zone for smoker in, park, shopping mall etc. In restaurants it is place at people go to have breakfast, lunch or dinner etc. I think people want a good place for a rest from hard work and meeting with family or friend. People want to eat delicious food. People do not want to stink. Stink is danger from smoke. Smoking made people feel bad when we eat delicious food and scent smoke. In some people when they receive the smoke it made they sneeze and it effect to they lung. Government should have campaign to people smoking decrease and campaign to blame from smoking. To reduce Global warming. Government should have legislation to the illegal. I think Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is very important in Thailand. Everybody should to do for we country.
