In Singapore, the act of smoking is generally frowned upon as it is detrimental to the smoker's health, as well as the people inhaling the smoke exhaled by the smoker. To enforce a ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country would probably result in cheers from the non-smoking camp, while disapprovals from the smokers would probably be of a very strong nature. Smoking results in tar and other carcinogenic substances accumulating in the lungs of people, which could then lead to lung cancer, obesity and other health problems. Second-hand smoke has been shown to be as harmful as first-hand smoke, if not worse. By imposing a ban on smoking at all the restaurants countrywide, all the health conscious people would probably be very strong supporters of the ban. They would no longer have to worry about how much longer they have to live due to the smoke generated by the person smoking at the next table while eating. While smoking is detrimental to the smoker and the people around him, we should not totally disregard him under the fa?ade of sacrificing the minority for the greater good. Due to nicotine in the cigarette, smokers have a need to smoke in order to repress the urge caused by nicotine addiction. By banning smoking at all the restaurants, the smokers would have been overlooked and might cause them great discomfort by not being able to smoke during meal times. I believe that extremities should not exist and that there should always be compromise when two or more parties are involved. Instead of banning smoking in restaurants, limit the smoking area to a smoking room away from the dining area so that the smokers are able to fulfill their urges without inconveniencing the other dinners.
