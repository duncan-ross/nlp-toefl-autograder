As a student studying at university, I feel that part time job may be essential to the learning experience. According to today's university competition, students' expense is highly increasing because the major reason is to improve many things in their university such as building, activities and also facilities thus student should have a part time job for getting some money to help their parents pay for registering at university. There are many good reasons to have a part-time job when students study in university. First of all, the students should spend their time accumulating experience for when they graduate and find a job in the real world. The part-time students' employment might have a good future: for instance, they can have patience and social skill moreover they also can adapt themselves with new situation so they must get a job easier than the others people who don't have a living skill in real community like part-time students' employment. Secondly, money from a students' part-time job can reduce parents' expense. In Thailand many manufacturing give an opportunity to students work in such as working in a restaurant or KFC, Seven Eleven, Chester grill, MC Donald and Baskin Robin etc. I think students should spend their spare time taking part-time jobs which become a way for students to meet their great knowledge in university lives.
