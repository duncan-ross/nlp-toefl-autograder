Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. If you have specific bills that need to be paid every month, such as the car insurance or cell phone, you will learn to budget so that you have enough money for them. This will make independent living less of a shock later on, when you will have multiple bills (rent, groceries, utilities, student loan, credit card, etc. ) to pay monthly. Having some of your own money also makes you appreciate its value. You may think twice about a purchase that you do not really need if it is coming out of your hard-earned paycheck. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on you hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. Customer service jobs in retail and food service require you to work with challenging people, but after seeing how things are on this side of the counter, you will approach the world with a much more compassionate attitude.
