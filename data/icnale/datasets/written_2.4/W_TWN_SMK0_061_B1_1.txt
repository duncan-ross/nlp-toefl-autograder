I agree that restaurants have to make a place without smoke. We all know smoking is bad for our body, but actually, people who smell second-hand smoking will get hurt worse. Restaurants are public area, we have to care about most people's health instead of insisting few people's right. I think that people can go outside smoking to prevent other people breathing their smoke if they really want to smoke. For example, in the university campus, there are many area set for smoker. I think it is a good way to take a balance between smokers and other people. In the respect to restaurants, obviously, the restaurant owners want more and more customers coming. However, if the owner want more customers, making a clean and comfortable restaurant environment is important. In other to care most customers' need, I think no smoking in the restaurant is necessary. Smoking or not depends on people themselves, however, people can not decide smelling second-hand smoke by self in the certain place or situation. Therefore, for our health, making place without smoke is everyone's responsibility. Although people have smoking right, in the contrast, people also have right that not to smell smoke. Therefore, I think no smoking restaurant is better.
