As a non-smoking person, I totally agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for our health, not to speak the second-hand smoke. When having food in a restaurant, people seek for comfort and relax. For this reason, no one is willing to be bothered, especially bothered by uncomfortable smell. In Taiwan, smoking is banned at most restaurants. Therefore, we have already taken it for granted. However, when my last trip to China, I can tell how important the topic is. Unlike Taiwan, wherever you have your meal in China, there is a kind of smell surrounds you--smell of smoking. After this terrible experience, I realize how important the topic is, for second-hand smoke does really bad to our health and our lungs. In my opinion, smoking is a really harmful habit, because it not only hurt the people who smoke, but others surround them. Besides, second-hand smoke is much more harmful to our human body. In order to have a healthy body and have a pleasure atmosphere when eating, we have to do our best to completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Taiwan.
