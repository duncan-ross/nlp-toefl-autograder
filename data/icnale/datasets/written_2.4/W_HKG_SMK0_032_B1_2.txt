From my view, I totally agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoker may say that smoking helps them to relax and release stress. But the negative aspects outweigh the positive. It is harmful for both smokers and non-smokers. Cigarettes are also addictive because of the nicotine it contains. Smoking is very bad for health and it should be banned. Smoking has deleterious effects on the passive smokers in the restaurants. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. In fact, about 3, 400 lung cancer deaths in non-smoking adults, caused by breathing in secondhand smoke. Although the money Government receives from taxing cigarette is very high, the cost of medical treatment for these diseases should not be ignored. Smoking causes a number of health problems such as asthma and lung cancer, which are expensive to treat. As a result of this non-smoking tax payers are forced to pay for the health costs of smokers. This is a very unfair situation. Smoking cost the economy at least 100 billion dollars in health care costs and lost productivity.
