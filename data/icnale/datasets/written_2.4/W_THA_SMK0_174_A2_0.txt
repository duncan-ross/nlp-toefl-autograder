Cigarette smoke contains over 4, 000 chemicals. Of those chemicals, 40 of them have been proven to cause cancer (SWAT). It's no wonder why a bill is being passed to ban smoking in all public places. However, this will have the greatest effect on restaurants across the nation. The next great smoking debate will decide whether you can "puff" in restaurants. In a democracy, like the one we live in, the majority rules, while trying to respect the rights of the minority. In this case, the minority being smokers, seem to have more rights than the majority. But the majority has taken it into their owns hands and passed a bill to ban smoking in all public places. The ban would only apply to the common areas of the restaurants, especially if the dining areas were enclosed and had a separate entrance. Smoking, however, might be prohibited in a lobby if a nearby restaurant wasn't enclosed. The restaurants should consider how to manage the place for smoking as well as place for eating. That shouldn't be together. I agree to ban smoking in the restaurants but as the same way it is doesn't need to be all restaurants if they can manage well.
