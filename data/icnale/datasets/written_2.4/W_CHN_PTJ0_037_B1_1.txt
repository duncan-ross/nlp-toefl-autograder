After entering the Wuhan University, I find quite a few students take part-time at weekends. Their occupations range from giving out papers to private tutors. Is it really important for a college student to have a part-time job? I think it depends on different persons' different situations. One of my roommates always tried to get a part-time job. She believes that herself is an adult and has the responsibility to support her life. Actually, many students are eager to become independent and to prove his or her ability. As far as I am concerned, I take a balanced view towards this phenomenon. On the one hand, if one student can balance the work and study well, he can choose to have a part-time job which is within his ability. Besides, the tuition burdens of his parents can be shared. Nevertheless, when a part-time job will occupy the importance of study, this job is unnecessary and the student shouldn't afford the risk of taking it. After all, as a student, he or she needs to put the study at the first place. In short, we all need to keep calm at this crossroads. Think twice before we take actions is essential. If you think you can have the balance between part-time job and your study, you can have a try.
