Because I think that college students have much free time and energy. In addition that they think get money and the effects of a part-time job are important. For example they acquire the communication, social ability and learn how the money is important and how hard get money is difficult. College also advises students to have a part-time job. It is the evidence that College also think having a part-time job is important. Actually, I have a part-time job four times a week and thirty-four hours in a month. And I realize what I want to do in the future and what kind of the jobs aren't much me. In other words experiencing have a part-time job helps college students to select lifetime job more smoothly. But having too many part-time jobs is not good for them. If students have too many, they probably couldn't study in college very well or don't attend their school. Also they might be able to keep up with the friends of their school by too many part time jobs. Result of that they might need a few years longer to graduate or couldn't graduate. Another bad effect is that get much money then they don't forget the importance of money. But it is very extreme instance so that the bad instance rarely occurs.
