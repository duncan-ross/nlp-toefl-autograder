I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Taiwan, because the smoking is not good for smokers, but also for people around them. Recently, the number of people who killed by smoking is increasing, half of them don't have the habit to smoke. But why they died in such as cancer and other sick caused by the smoking? The answer is that they breathing in too many second smoke that more unhealthy for the people. Therefore, even if they don't smoke eventually they killed by other smokers. I think this is so fanny for that why no smoking people should be treated by the pain what the smokers should take for. To decrease the risk that those no smoking people take to, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And not just banned at all the restaurants, but also banned at all public place. This is not just taking a care of the no smoking people but the smokers. By this way, the smokers will decrease the times of smoking because there is no place for them to smoke. After long times, they will too forget they are heavy smoker before. The world also can return to the no smoking parodies.
