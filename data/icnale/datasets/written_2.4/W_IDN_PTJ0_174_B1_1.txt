I think it is important to for college students to have a part time job. Because the college student actually have skill for to apply. Also because it make they know how live in world work. Beside there is some student that need some income for pay the college and continue studying. Even in small business that not give a lot of money. The important thing is the student can apply what is the student have learning. A part time job make student creative for thinking what is need for his future and make student don't have to waiting for money from the parent. A part time job can fill the free time of the student prefer than make it for game and etc. Part time job have a negative for student. For example, part time job can change student just think for money not think about study. So a part time job have supported by student party. So student not just think about money but they thinking about study for student better future. Now part time job is hard to looking for. Many student is looked for alternative. When holiday they are looking for full time job for they money income.
