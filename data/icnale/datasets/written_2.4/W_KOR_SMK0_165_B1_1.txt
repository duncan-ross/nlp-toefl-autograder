The opinions of smoking area are still hot potato. When we go to any restaurants and cafes, we can see smoking area for non-smokers. Why they make a smoking area? I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and cafes in the country. First, if people smoke cigarette in restaurant, non-smoker feel unpleasant. When I went to pub to talk with my friends, some people smoke straight at next table so cigarette smoke was flew to our table. We smelled with own nose about cigarette smoke and everyone felt unpleasant. Also, we wanted to claim to smoker at next table people but we could do this. I think that non-smoker's rights are more important than smoker. Above all things, non-smoker's rights can be respected to protect the health of non-smoker. I heard that second-hand smoking is more dangerous than smoking directly. Second-hand smoking is a big health hazard. Also, being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema. Especially, children are easily vulnerable to secondhand smoke unconsciously. Maybe, smokers argue own rights of smoking clearly. But if smokers know that non-smokers feel unpleasant and are exacerbated by them, they can't smoke in front of non-smokers anymore. I hope that no one smoke in the world will be coming soon.
