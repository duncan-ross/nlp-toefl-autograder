In my opinion, based on my personally view, I really agree because the restaurant is a public restaurant. They are places which provide services for anyone who likes to have food outside their houses. All people who go to restaurants have mainly reason to have a special time with their special persons. They may plan to have something to surprise their companies. Therefore, in those restaurants should not have any single person who is smoking inside the restaurants. The disadvantage of smoking is not just only a man who smoke but it will affect the people around inside with the smokers. What if in the restaurants, there are ladies, kids, old people, can you imagine how bad is it? The disadvantage of smoking in all restaurants can also represent the image of the social. If non of restaurants do not put attention to this issues, I think there are a lot of side effect that can impact the restaurants. The owner should be made no-smoking signs in restaurants. Smoking is not allowed to smoke, they should see the sign clearly. Or should develop places for smokers. To the environment in general society and individuals will be happier to see non of people smoking in the resturants.
