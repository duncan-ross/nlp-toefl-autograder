Smoking has always been a complicated issue in modern society in that most people know it is harmful but it can not be thoroughly banned strictly, even in public places such as restaurants. From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First and foremost, it is known to us all that smoking does great harm to human beings. Not only the one who smokes but also people stay around him will all get poisoned, especially when the people around are all eating, which leads to the harm to people's lungs and even cancer and it is widely known that cancer has now become one of the most dangerous killers in today's society. With the speeding up of our living pace and the rapid development of our economy, our human life has been rotten by industrial pollution day after day, which draws us a conclusion that we have to spare no effort in protecting ourselves phyically at least in aspects we can handle by ourselves such as preventing smoking as much as possible. Secondly, smoking also awfully affects our environment. It is estimated that smokers produce some kinds of poisonous subatances doing their enjoyable leisure time, which can proceed a series of chemical change with other substances in the air and finally turn out to be the contributor of our polluted atmosphere. Hence, in the consideration of environmental protection, smoking should definitely be banned in public, not to mention public places such as restaurants which should offer customers a comfortable and healthy eating atmosphere. What's more, smoking in restaurants will also influence the image of the restaurant, even the image of the city. Smoking symbolizes the terrible living habits of people and may impress everyone coming to the country with unpleasant feelings. All in all, for the sake of everyone and our society, smoking in restaurants should absolutely be forbidden all around the country.
