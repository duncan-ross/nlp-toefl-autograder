Many students have trouble deciding whether to study in group or not, however, studying alone is much better in many ways. First of all, studying alone has no restriction on place, while studying in group requires suitable place where it is okay to make some noise. Students can study alone anywhere according to personal preference. On the contrary, as long as studying in group accompanies discussions or explanations, it is unavoidable to make some noise. Therefore, students have to find right place to study which is quite annoying. Second, self studying helps students concentrate more and get deeper understand. There is nothing that interrupts student's concentration. On the other hand, group studying is subject to be distracted as study members become closer through studying together. Lastly, students can pace themselves when they study alone. Each student has different grasping ability. Some students can learn easier and faster while others need more time understanding. However, when students study in group, sometimes they should wait or hurry to catch up with others. Especially, students who lack understanding may be busy just following others progress without understanding and it will lead to the loss of the student's pace. Therefore, studying alone is more convenient and effective than studying in group.
