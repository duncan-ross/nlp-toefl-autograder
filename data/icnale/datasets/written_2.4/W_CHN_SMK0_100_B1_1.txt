In recent years, we see more and more people smoke everywhere in public places like street, supermarkets, restaurants, and so on. Some people think we should ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country. Opinions of whether it should be banned in restaurants vary from person to person. First of all, as far as we know, smoking is bad for our health; Health body is our capital for struggling live, if we don't have healthy body, how can we live our life to the full? So you eat and smoke together in the restaurants, it is very harmful. More importantly, if you smoking in restaurant, it will influence other people where closed to you, these people who will have an uncomfortable feeling while he smelled this taste. They come to restaurants to have a good meal, not to smell cigarette smoke. We must put other's thoughts in our hearts, and can't leave the public behind. Most important, some people think that restaurants are comfortable places for those people who are busy all the days around. But the thoughts of others who can't live with smokes can't be over emphasized. Perhaps, to solve this issue is not easy at all, but it's worth trying. We should do our best, such as hold a speech in public announce that the disadvantage for smoking or do some more Public service advertising to improve the present situation. The government set a rule to force people smoke outside of the restaurants. I do believe it will be better in the future.
