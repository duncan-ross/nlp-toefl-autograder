I agree. College students should make a point of securing at least one part-time job before graduation. The job-market is so cutthroat and students need to be aware of this fact. It's a dog eat dog world when it comes to scoring a job these days and having at least one example of work experience, could mean the difference between getting a job or missing out, because it really does get that close sometimes. Having worked in a part-time job while at college makes a statement to employers. It tells them that for whatever motivation a student may have had for getting a part-time job, that the student was serious, clearly must have learned some kind of work ethic, and took on added responsibility. Employers will also know that by increasing their workload, the student must also possess some basic organizational skills as well. These may seem like trivial points but to an employer, more often than not, it is the little things that make or break the deal or cause system failures. It is the little things that add up, just as there many spokes in the standard bicycle wheel, so too there are many synergistic components that make up the whole of the business world.
