How do you feel if you enter a restaurant full of smoke? I want to escape from it as soon as possible. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, restaurant is a public place where people go there for enjoying meals. If someone there smokes, the environment is polluted. Can you enjoy a meal at a place full of smoke? The majority of the customers will not walk in the restaurant. The person who smokes ruins a fantastic meal of others and sometimes also a good mood. So banning smoking can ensure a good environment for the customers. If you have a choice, would you enter a non-smoking restaurant or enter a restaurant full of smoke? Smoking does harm to us and smoke makes us feel uncomfortable. So perhaps almost everyone will choose the non-smoking one. It also means that it will appeal to more customers if a restaurant bans smoking. It is a conclusion that smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country will benefit both the owners of the restaurants and the customers. So the policy should be carried out smoothly and immediately.
