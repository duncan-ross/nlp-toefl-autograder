Part time jobs for college student is not essential. Now a days due to shortage economy the parents are not allowed of children to read more and more. Our Government school has a lot of diplomas and degrees but they have no good teacher. Due to economy problems the students are not able to score the knowledge. Because the private colleges and universities have high fee and due to shortage money parents are not permit to getting the knowledge. So for this reason when the student are getting certificates they don't coming to college due to high fee and fines also. They struggle for job at anywhere. Because they have no more knowledge they have no got good job. Some peoples who don't like more study and after college they become a officer. So it is not a possible because nothing is possible without knowledge like jobs etc. Mostly economy problems which tried to got a job for any students. But it is impossible. Because many people who have degrees and diplomas they have no job. So how job can be got after passing out from college. Knowledge is very important so the students should be got first knowledge then jobs.
