I agree with college students have a part-time job. Because I think that is a way to stand on oneself. First I think people must earn money that to pay for one's hobby, cloth and meal (lunch or dinner) when they become college student or graduated from high school. I think people who graduated from high school is enough adult to be independent of their parents and to earn one's money. Those people will (or must) learn to earn money in public by oneself from part-time job. In that case we don't put a strain for our parents and we can pay money as we like. Second we can work in society. We had less chance to work in public. We don't know how to work in society and to communicate with people who haves same job (but they don't same age). We can learn what about working to earn money in society and we have responsible for our job. And we can learn how to communicate with boss, colleague, business connection and customer. Thus we can learn these things before we become member of society. For the reason of two things, I think part-time job is useful to learn work in public for college students. And we can make time class, study, club and so on, if we have part-time (not full-time) job. That is why I agree with college students having a part-time job.
