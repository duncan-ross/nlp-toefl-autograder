 Well, I don't think having a part time job is necessary for a college student. But it should be extremely helpful for college students. Different people may have lives, so for some student he or she will be suit for a part time job or not. Namely, part time job is not necessary for everyone, though it may be welcome to some students. What influences a student's decision on doing a part time job is consist of family background financial situation education environment and personal college plans. For someone who was born in a rich family, doesn't lack money and is showered by academic voices, what he needs to do is get higher degrees, higher scores and more knowledge. If he chooses to do a part time job, it may get in the way of his study. On the contrary, for a person from a poor family or who plans to struggle in the society, learning how to survive is more necessary. Ability skills and relationship are more important for this type of person. In that case, having a part time job may be a better choice. All in all, as we see, something may have two sides.
