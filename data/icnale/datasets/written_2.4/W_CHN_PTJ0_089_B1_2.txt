After the horrific college entrance examination, we 17 or18-year-old boys and girls came to the campus. The world seems to be open to us. All things attract us. The activities in school are more than we can imagine. The life is full of happiness. But when we look back, we'll see it's important to have more experience and to learn more from college. And it's true that more and more companies pay attention to the social skills. So doing part-time job becomes very popular among college students. What can we get so far? First of all, students can promote their study through part-time job. For example, if an educational student take a part-time job in a school, his experience will enable him to better understand what he learned from the books. There's more. The student can get more opportunities beyond what he has been taught in a class, and he will know something that doesn't exist in books but in practice. Besides, students can develop some other talents in other areas. At last, they will discover their sense of self-worth and develop their future job hunting. The full-time job will be warmed up from a part-time job, and then they will gain great achievement. We'll see that money is difficult to earn. It remains us to be simple and unadorned. It's important and necessary to have a part-time job, and more students should follow it. That's the conclusion.
