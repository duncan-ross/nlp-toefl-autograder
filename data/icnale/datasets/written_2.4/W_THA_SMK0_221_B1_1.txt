I agree with Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking has many disadvantages for health. smoke cigarette have many toxic substances, for example carbon monoxide, mercury, formaldehyde, carcinogens, nicotine. That nicotine is s risk factor causing disease several species. Such as cardiac disease, myocardial ischemia, lung cancer, bronchitis, air bag aneurysm and respiratory disease. It affects the pump and close injured by toxic substances. We need to set non-smoking. To protect quality of life of those who do not smoke and reduce the risk of illness from the disease smoke cigarette. Because smoking no- good for healthy. The only restaurants install air-conditioning with limited space. In present most people, especially those who live in city. The restaurants are popular for the party of family. In the restaurants have many people. Smoking makes losing money unnecessarily. Also cigarette is expensive. Smoking lost time, healthy not good. Also damage health and destroy environment. It pollutes the air. If have who smoking other people get bad atmosphere. I think the law should prohibit smoking in all public places. Penalties that are strictly prohibited. Campaign against that issue seriously. If people do not smoke the society a better places. So for good health. And happy to eat. We must ban smoking at all restaurants.
