 I agree to this opinion. We all know smoking is harmful to our health and it is a bad habit. I think smoking ban heart gains massive. The follows are advantages of smoking bans. The first, Bans on smoking in restaurants have had a bigger impact on preventing heart attacks than ever expected, data shows. Therefore, there are many good things bans on smoking in public place. In China, there have a word; children are the future of the country. However, Children exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke have an increased risk of development in adulthood, even if they never smoked. This is very dangerous to our children. So in my view of opinion, we must take a measure to smoking ban on public place. I think every Chinese knows many people are dead in heart attack and lung cancer in our country, this is cause to secondhand cigarette smoke. Though we are not smoking, secondhand cigarette smoke have a big harmful to our body. Now, many countries have law about smoking bans. Many studies add to the growing evidence that a ban on smoking in public places seems to have a positive impact on heart attack rates, which is clearly good news for our nation's heart health. Nevertheless, the statistics also shows how quickly the benefits can be felt after a smoking ban is implemented and indicate how dangerous second-hand smoke can be to the heart. I think it is a good idea to ban smoking in all restaurants in the country, everyone will support this bans.
