I partially agree this statement. In general, customers in restaurants can be roughly divided onto smokers and non-smokers. For non-smokers, they totally agree the statement but non-smokers not. I think somking should be completely banned at SOME restaurants. For non-smokers, they mainly concern about the healthy problem. When smokers smoke in the restaurants, smoke from the cigarettes can spread throughout the restaurant. Those non-smoking customers will be passively smoking. Generally, people spend a quite a long time to have a meal. Under the situation mentioned above, it is highly possible to have healthy problems to those non-smoking customers, especially to the elderly, babies and pregnant women. Those smokers' such behavior is not considerate as they force those non-smoking customers to smoke. For smokers, they cannot get rid of smoking because of addiction. They need to smoke in the restaurants. Without a doubt, smokers also are customers. They have freedom to smoke in restaurant. This is the most important point that whether smoke can spread to the non-smoking customers' site or not. If the restaurant can be divided into smoking areas and non-smoking areas in the restaurant, it will fulfill all the customers' needs. Non-smoking customers can enjoy their meal without any smoke and smokers can smoke in the restaurant. So, if all the customers are more considerate, It can establish a win-win situation. It is not a must to completely banning smoking in ALL the restaurants.
