I disagree because I believe that it would distract too much from the students studies and the reason that students often fail or drop out of college is because of too many distractions and not enough study. Working at a part-time job would create too much pressure on the student and would prevent the student from allocating the majority of their time to studying which is the sole reason they are at college in the first place. If the student has no need to work then I strongly recommend that devote eighty percent of their time studying. They will accomplish far more by zeroing in on their study materials striving for high scores on their tests and graduating, and then they can get a job. In the meantime, students should forget about working and do the only job that students are meant to be doing at college and that is studying. There will always be exceptions to the rule and college is no different in that there will be students that need to work because of monetary reasons and if that is the case then the students will just have to work and hopefully, they will still do well and graduate without too many problems.
