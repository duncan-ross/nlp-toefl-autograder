I agree. Youth for the passion and ambition and a dream life. At this time more comfortable and easy, we should really think hard and be tired and adventure. Wise eyes see the world becoming so hard to know what is easy, knowing you would be happy to know. All 20s have big dreams. The dream for all the support will do. So before we go out in society I would like to try things. Do not learn in school will learn life skills or experience. But more important than what I snow apart-time work experience matters more than money to get to know that. Front view looking at the money that he wants to have the experience to believe than buying. We are undergoing trials and sufferings will be an adult. We cope wise you're going to lead us to only a small mistake. I love the young. Challenge to try and painful period is probably time. We know. Length ahead of upcoming knows that in a society where we experience challenging and made me have to go. So, I agree. Looking back, the connection is always dreamed and always curious to see what the youth think that you need to feel. I always want to be a talent for the country. Therefore need to love history and culture, I think. In order to develop the country got a lot of thought I have been able to do. I want to do what I always think that the experience of all. To do this, first thing in the dream and experience should be selected. Thus, the dream of his to challenge for the think is a part-time work for young people.
