As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Smoking in public is prohibited. Now, in many public places are set special smoking-room, giving people who want to smoke providing a place. In my opinion, this is a very good method to prevent people from smoking in public places. Why we all say that smoking is harmful? Although in some smokers opinion, smoking is to alleviate the pressure of work, can let their spirits up. But, smoking has serious threat to people's health. Our health is very important. We can reduce our stress by many other ways. For example, we can go out to travel or chat with friends. These are some useful method to release our minds. Then, Smoking let us spend a lot of money. This is a kind of unnecessary spending. If we donate these money to the hope project, it will be how meaningful. Smoking in public is very immoral. Because, while your smoking in public, other non-smokers also can be affected. We should consider for others because this is very important. For the sake of our health, we should try to minimize the number of smoking. In a word, smoking is harmful to our health.
