I agree with this statement, it's essential that college students have a part-time job. I have two reasons why I support that statement. First, College student learn that money is important and hard to make from experiencing their part-time jobs. Before going to college, in Korean situation, many students might have never earned money. Most of them may not have certain concept about money. Making money by themselves lets them think about what money is and how they spend the money economically. It helps them to build the concept of economics and to learn how important money is. Second, Part-time job is important in that it give the students chances of experiencing society in advance. Before becoming a member of society, they can learn what society is like and how they handle some problems from their part-time jobs. In my case, I had been serving at a restaurant for 6months. From the experience, I've learned that I should behave and talk nicely to my boss although I don't feel like doing it. Also there wasn't an excuse for my mistake even if it's not all my fault. Having a part-time job is very helpful to college student in that that experience makes them shape their economic standard and concept. It helps also them experience society before being a member of a society.
