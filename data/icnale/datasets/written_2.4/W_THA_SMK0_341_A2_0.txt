I agree with topic b is smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because of the restaurant in the country should have a very clean air a restaurant. I think is not good if many people smoke in restaurants because in the restaurant have a lot of people. The restaurant in the country have a child, old person. A smoking not good for healthy with own smoker and other person too. A smoking have a pollution very much with environment. If The restaurants in the country should be complete banned the people are happy to eat in the restaurants and have fresh air because of don't have a pollution from smoking. And banning smoking complete at all restaurants is very safety for the customers are eat in restaurants and can make safety from smoker come in restaurant. All the restaurant in the country should have to label banned smoking in restaurants. And label in the restaurants should be interesting sign board because of make to customers understand to disadvantage from smoking and must not smoking at all restaurant in the country because of safety for healthy other people ant safety for smoker too. Banned completely smoking at all the restaurant is very good for most people whom come to eat and good for health everybody come in restaurant.
