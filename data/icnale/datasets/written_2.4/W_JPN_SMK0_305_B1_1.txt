I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons why I agree this. First, smoking is very bad for not only smokers' health, but also non smokers' health. From adult to child, even pregnant mother's baby, we are always faced with danger. Tobacco fumes cause various diseases. For instance, lung cancer, stomach cancer, heart break and so on. These diseases are very bad for our body. There is possibility that patients who have got these diseases will die because of these diseases. Non smokers' possibilities of getting these diseases are higher than smokers'. So, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country to protect from bad fumes. Second reason why Iagree this is that Japanese smokers' manner is too bad. There are alot of cigarette ends everywhere. Cigarette ends are one of the causes which invite environmental problems. Tobacco fumes' smell is too bad. We can't eat dishes deliciously because of bad tobacco fumes' smells. Even if restaurants divided tables into smoking seats and non smoking seats, we probably feel bad smells. So, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. In this way, Iagree that we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants. If this realizes, we will be able to eat dishes comfortably atrestaurants in Japan!
