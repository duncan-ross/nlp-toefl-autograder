Smoking is becoming more and more unpopular in the world, for it makes air smelly and do harm to human health. So many policies have been put out to forbid the smoking in public places, like library, transportation services and other public sites. And I think smoking should be banned in restaurants across the country as well. For the first reason, smoking in restaurants is extremely harmful to human health system. In most restaurants, the air flows slowly. It means if someone smokes in a restaurant, the nicotine will remain in the restaurant for a long time, haunting around the neighbor tables. This provides people with more chances to get illness. Additionally, smoking in restaurants will have negative influence in other consumers. The smelly air containing nicotine will make people sick and uncomfortable. Suppose a family is spending their happy time, in the big brother's birthday. However they are affected by the smelly smoke and the happy family dinner is ruined. Actually, this is not we want to see. Plus, smoking is not kind of good behavior in China. In order to enhance the civilization and make the city a better place to live, a ban toward smoking should be acted out in the restaurants. By banning the smoking in public place, people would be happy without concerns about annoying smokes.
