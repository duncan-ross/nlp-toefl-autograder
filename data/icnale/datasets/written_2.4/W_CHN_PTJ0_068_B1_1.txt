 Personally speaking, I think it's of great value for college student to have a part-time job but I don't believe that it's necessary for them to work. On one hand, that college students have plenty of time is well known for us. So, firstly I suppose that they are ought to take advantage of their time and show their value in society while earn their own disposable money. Secondly, I'm in favor of the idea that a excellent college student must be able to balance their time in school and in society, therofore, I think take part-time can show one's ability in time management and give students knowledge on all sides. Thirdly, as we all know, the experiences of taking part-time jobs, especially in some big companies, can add color to college students' CV and help them to find a better job after graduation. On the other hand, I don't speak up for that every college students must go and find part-time jobs. First, some of them just enjoy the life with the surrounding of books, teachers, etc. they don't mind being nerds. Moreover, in fact, students who study in majors such as pscology, history are not easy to find a job, thus, they are supposed to devote more to doing research or studying rather than hunting part-time jobs. Also, good grade in a particular field is important too, which equals to the so-called experiences. All in all, college students may gain a lot from these kinds of precious experiences of part-time jobs, but we shouldn't attach to much importance to these.
