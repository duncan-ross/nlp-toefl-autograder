For one reason, a student's main goal and purpose is to study hard, do the best they can and never give up on the task which they have been given. Hopefully, attain a scholarship that may somehow lessen the burden of their financial problem. As expected, the majority of college students have their parents and guardians guiding them, helping them during the years of the college students learning by paying the tuition fees, acknowledging the college student's grades and performances. Guardians and parents are even worried if their child does not come home on time, or does not reply to the messages they have been sending – scared that they might have joined fraternities or have been kidnapped and stuffs like that. Basically, they are scared for their child's safety considering the status of our society (third world country problems) thinking of the worst possibilities. Financial problem and the experiences gained in working should not be worried by students because by the time they graduate, they can work whichever way they want, at midnight or in the afternoon – not worrying about any other task that should be done in school whatsoever. If they are working while studying, the tendency is that they would have to be studying by the day and working by the dawn. Either they would have a poor time management or they won't have any time to rest at all. Lack of rest leads to failing marks, and worst, sickness. As a young dreamer, my ambition is to have a successful company, to have many business associates and lead my own team. As a college student, I would like to concentrate on my studies first before doing anything that will risk the chances of my unbecoming.
