With the improvement of the quality of our lives, we care more about our health. However, we set a potential hazard in our daily life. It is the smoking. As we all know, smoking has a lot of bad effect on us. I think it is necessary to ban smoking in restaurants. Here are my reasons. Firstly, the smell of cigarettes is offensive, which turns people's stomach. Restaurant is the place where people have meals. The offensive smell fills the restaurant, which affect people's appetite. All of us want to have meals in good and clean surroundings, so it is necessary to drive the smell of cigarettes out of restaurants. This happens only if smoking is banned in restaurants. Secondly, restaurant is a public place. People of all ages, from babies to the old, get into the restaurants. The cigarettes have a harmful effect on people's health, especially pregnant women, babies and the old. If someone smokes in the restaurant, all of people in the restaurants are forced to have passive smoking. Passive smoking has more disadvantages than active smoking. Smoking is an action that builds your happiness upon the unhappiness of somebody else. Such behavior should be banned immediately. To sum up, as smoking in restaurants does harm to all of people there, the government should ban smoking in restaurants. Therefore, we can have a nice and clean surroundings to enjoy our meals.
