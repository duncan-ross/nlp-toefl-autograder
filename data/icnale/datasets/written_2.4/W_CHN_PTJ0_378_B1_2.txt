Nowadays, more and more students took part in some part time jobs. Some of my friends also took some part time jobs during the last summer after the college entrance exam. However, in my opinion, taking part time jobs is really not a brilliant idea. First of all, some kind of part time job is really a waste of time. For example, one of my friends who was accepted by a famous university decided to send leaflet during her part time. But as I think, no matter what happened, I really don't believe that a person graduated from that kind of school would have another chance to send leaflet. So he is just wasting his time. And someone would say that except for this kind of part time job, Other kind of part time job might be a kind of exercise. Unfortunately, I disagree with it either. As a student, the most important thing for us is studying. No matter how much part time job you did, the most important thing is still your studying skills. And another thing is, it can release the pressure of their family. I think, for some students whose parents are not as rich as others', this might be a way. But it's just a way, not a perfect way. Not to mention those who can afford the cost of college. After all, as I just said, you have to put your studying time into pieces to participate some part time jobs. It will certainly affect your studying. So for those whose parents can afford their college life, I think it's better toyou're your mind in studying to make more money for your parents and yourself. So I think this is it, my opinion of part time jobs.
