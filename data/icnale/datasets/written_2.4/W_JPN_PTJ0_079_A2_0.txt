I agree with this opinion. There are several reasons. First, we can experience how to work. Most of us haven't worked in the high school, so I think we don't know how to speak and how to act in the working place. Thanks for a part-time job we can know such things, and we are familiar with working. Second, we can earn money. Needless to say, it is very important for college students to earn money, especially for living alone. We spend a lot of money, so we need as much money as possible. Third, we can make friends. There are many people in the working place, so we can be good terms of them. However, I don't have any part-time job now. I'm too busy to have part-time job. We college students have a lot of things to do. We should have a driver's license, study hard and club activity and so on. In addition, I'm not familiar with my college, so I am going to have a part-time job after summer vacation. I am going to teach junior high school students. How hard for us to have a part-time job, we have a job in the future. I think that I can know about myself by having a part-time job, and thanks for it, I will find my job in the future.
