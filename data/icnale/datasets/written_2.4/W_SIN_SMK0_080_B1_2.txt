Yes, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. In Singapore, most restaurants are air-conditioned and the food does not come cheap either. As such, the people who patronize restaurants should be treated with respect and have the ability to enjoy their food peacefully in a smoke-free environment. It is not reasonable for restaurant-goers who do not smoke to eat their food in the presence of second-hand smoke. Even if smokers are seated in a "smoking area", I am sure that the smoke still travels in the air and affects the non-smoking diners. So I feel that smoking should be banned in all parts of the restaurants, in all restaurants in Singapore. Also, smoking has no benefits but only negative consequences. This occurs to both the smokers and passers-by. By smoking, smokers will harm their lungs and bodies; also, cigarettes do not come by cheaply. Smokers spend their money wastefully. Also, innocent passers-by are subjected to the second-hand smoke which is in fact more poisonous than first-hand smoke! It is not reasonable for non-smokers to suffer from illnesses and diseases for just inhaling other people's smoke. To be fair, the people who wish to smoke before, after, or even in-between a meal, should go outside of the restaurant and find someplace else to smoke. By banning smoking at a restaurant, one is not restricting smoking, but merely restricting the area that pertains smoking. Conclusively, I feel that banning smoking has more positive outcomes than negative, hence it is advisable to ban smoking at all restaurants in Singapore.
