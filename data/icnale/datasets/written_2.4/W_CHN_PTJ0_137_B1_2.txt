 People seldom agree with each other even in such trivial issues. It is a little bit haste to say that It is important or unimportant for college students to have a part-time job. For me, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. On the one hand, in college, we have more free time, so we can use our spare time to do some useful things. Just like a part-time job. Then, we enrich our experience of life. We can also learn much experience for our future careers. On other hand, we can earn money by ourselves. Now, we are all supported by our parents. Many students do not know how tiresome their parents are. So, I think by dong some part-time jobs, while they get some money, they can profoundly understand their parents. Then, they may save their money and study hard. In addition, It is a good opportunity for college students to know this society. I do not think it is early. We only have 4 years in college. So we must grip every chance to learn something. In part-time job we would know many people and can look something carefully. Those are my opinions. According to my current situation, I stick to regard it as a beneficial thing.
