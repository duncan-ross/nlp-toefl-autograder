A saying goes, "you should faithful to own your work. " This means that students don't need to earn money during school days. Thus, I'm in favor of the idea that it has never been important students to be a part-time worker. It's because students have a right to enhance their ability. Moreover, enjoying college life is important part of students' lives as well. First of all, spending a lot of time with improving talent is the most significant part of their lives. It's true that students who haven't worked during school days have better grade than students who have worked. For example, one of my friends got a temporary work, when she was sophomore. At that time, she couldn't concentrate on her study. Finally, she got the worst grade in that year. From those days on, she didn't try to searching for any part-time works. Besides, enjoying college life should be helpful to improve student's commercial skills. That means that students can interact with their classmates as participation in many schools circles such as team sports, band groups and so on. Students can exclusively make a variety of experiences through group activities. A study has shown that students who have enjoyed their school life's can make more successful life than others. In other words, growing commercial skill might become a key to successful life. For all those reasons, I strongly support on the idea of developing not only your faculty but communication skills. In order to get better life in the future, they have to make a good time schedules. Life style of college life might determine their whole life.
