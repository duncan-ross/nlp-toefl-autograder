I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Firstly, the college students should have spent more time and concentrate on what they should be doing right now which is studying. College students might get too distracted when they are engaged into a part time job as they need to spend some of their time doing work and result in lesser time in doing their assignments, projects and tutorials. This is undesirable as they are not fulfilling their job as a student. Furthermore, some students might feel tired after working and the next day morning they might not have the energy to attend lectures and tutorials. Some might even use their part time job as an excuse to skip classes if they don't want to go school. However, college students can gain working experiences from part time job and this cannot be learned from studies. Some students might even apply what they had learned in school to their part time job. And this allows students to experience what exactly they had learned and put in to real use. Hence, college students getting a part time job is not important however, there are benefits of it to be considered.
