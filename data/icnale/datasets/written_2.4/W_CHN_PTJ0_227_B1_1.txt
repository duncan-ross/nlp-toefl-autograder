Yes, I firmly believe that a part-time job is necessary to the college students, even if the others do not agree. Here are some reasons which can prove my conclusion. First of all, we can earn some money from having a part-time job. When on campus, we still need our parents' supports. We need money for life and study. So, once having a job, we can relieve our parents' pressure and be responsible for our own life. Moreover, It does great help to our future life. Having a job means important thing that we start to make connection to the society. We can contact with many people from all walks of life and we can obtain lots of information from them. It can benefit us a lot to our future life. Last but not least, a part-time job teaches us the hardship of making a life. Nowadays, because of the great life and the love of the parents, many students spend money at will. It can have a negative impact on the future. Doing a job can help us understand it. Although having a part-time job may influence our studying and our health, I still consider that it does great benefits on us. All in all, if we have enough time, we should take an active part in the part-time job. We can experience a lot through it and it will gradually become precious deposits of our whole life.
