I don't agree this statement. Of course student have a part-time job is a good phenomenon. But that is not everything. Outside activity is waiting. Going to the mountain, sea, palace is good activity for student. But nowadays, part-time job is required student. Registration fee is so high; student is finally seeking a part-time job. But don't mind registration fee, do not important part-time job. Many people think that part-time job is good experience and earn money. I agree this statement. But the world is many experience activity. For example, habitat and volunteer, travel etc. Part-time job is not entire to campus life. Student has to broaden think. Some student is regret to campus life. That's why concentrate on study. Afterward, he saw the past life, don't remain thing. So, campus life is finally return to me. Twenty is most important time anyone. Time is not return. I want to go to abroad and meet a friend. And understand different culture. Additionally, reading a book is enjoying another travel. Book is solving no time and no money. Absolutely part-time job is important is wrong. Anywhere doing activities and make up experience. Maybe people think abnormal activity is good to me college student. The world is wide and a lot of doing things.
