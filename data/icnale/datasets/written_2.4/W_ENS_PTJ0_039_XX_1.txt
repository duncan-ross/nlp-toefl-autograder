Whether not college student should have a part-time job has been a matter of serious discussion for as long as I can remember. This issue was still widely talked about when I first enrolled in school when I was only 18 years old, and now, 11 years later, it is still a matter of some debate. I think this is because no matter how the times change or how society or culture evolves, people will always be different, and it will be difficult to make rules that will perfectly suited everyone to which they apply. When it comes to part-time work, the simple fact of the matter is that students should decide on an individual basis whether or not part-time work is important for them and only them. I don't understand why anyone else feels they have a right to weigh in on the subject when the person who is at stake is legally an adult and can do things and make decisions for themselves. Students who are not mature enough to benefit from the experience of a part-time job will naturally stay away from such a pursuit. On the other hand, students who feel they are ready for a part-time job will get one. Only they can decide whether or not the time is right.
