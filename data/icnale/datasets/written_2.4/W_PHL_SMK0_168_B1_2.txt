Smoking cigarettes is not an action that everyone enjoys. Not only does it irritate non-smokers who do not appreciate the scent, but it also posts health risks for each and every one of us. With this as the case, I firmly agree with the proposition that smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants here in the Philippines. Restaurants are there to serve customers foods which are prepared hygienically. For people to smoke inside a restaurant completely defeats this purpose. Cigarettes contain numerous chemicals which may contaminate the food. Various customers are also present in restaurants. The ages and health conditions of these people may vary greatly. To smoke inside the establishment will not provide a healthy environment for everyone. It is not only a concern of the irritating scent, but rather the possible health complications that may be instantly triggered by cigarette smoke (i. e. asthma). Children exposed to smoke may also be prone to sicknesses and other diseases. Expecting mothers inhaling smoke may affect the health of their babies, as well. Should people wish to smoke, then they may so in appropriate smoking areas or at least outside the establishment concerned. Smoking in open areas will allow the smoke to dissipate into the environment. Although these are the possible alternatives to smoking inside the restaurants, smoking still isn't recommended due to its numerous ill effects to one's health.
