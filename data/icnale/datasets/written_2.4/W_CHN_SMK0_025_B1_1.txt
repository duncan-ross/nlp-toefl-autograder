It has been a hot topic for a long time whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people take it for granted that smoking should be banned, while there are still others who disagree with it. As for me, my favor goes to the former opinion. I have some reasons described in the following. As we all know, smoking is very harmful to our health. What is more, smoke can cause all kinds of disease that it may make a man die. For example, there are a great many of people die of smoking every year. This is the result of smoking. Another reason t for smoking should be banned, especially at the public place, such as restaurants, hospitals, and so on. And it is clear that restaurant is a place we have lunch. If someone next to you always smoke when you eating food, you probably cannot start it., leaving the lunch and wanting to go. As stated above, what should we do? There is no doubt that we should exert all ours energy to ban smoke at all the restaurants in the country. Now, let us start and make progress together!
