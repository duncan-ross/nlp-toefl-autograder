I agree and do believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Indeed, upon graduating from university, I already had part-time work experience in nine different jobs. Although the main "job" of a college student is to study, the reality is that most can easily hold one or two part-time jobs without having their grades suffer. The college years are an ideal time in one's life to explore one's interests and engage in a variety of unique experiences. This is because the only obligation most students have is to make the most of their time in college and to graduate. Any job experience gained in college will allow the student to make a more informed choice in the future when they enter the adult job market where one's choice of full-time employment will have far-reaching and more long-term consequences. For example, constant job switching as an adult will make it difficult for one to be promoted, receive raises in salary, or become more expert in their field. In short, college students should take advantage of the opportunity to job-hop while it is permissible in the eyes of society. Post-graduation experimentation in the job market will be frowned upon so the ability to make an informed decision regarding one's occupation as early as possible is most beneficial.
