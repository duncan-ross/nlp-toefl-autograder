Smoking is one of the most dangerous potential killers in our daily life. It does harm to not only the smokers but also the ones around the smokes. It may lead to lung diseases or even threaten our lives. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The restaurant is a public place where lots of people have meals together. So it is necessary to keep its environment clean and tidy or people will feel bad, which may make them not go here any more. Smoking will lead to its atmosphere being foul, which will make other consumers uncomfortable. What's worse, there may be many children or pregnant women in the restaurant, whose health can be heavily influenced by smoking. I think smoking in public places is not a good habit, especially in the restaurants. This kind of behavior has something to do with the quality of citizens in a country. All of us should take the responsibility not to smoke in the restaurants and other public places. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Completely banning smoking at all the restaurants will really make us and others feel better.
