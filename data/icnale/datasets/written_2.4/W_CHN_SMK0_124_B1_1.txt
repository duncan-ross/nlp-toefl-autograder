There is no doubt that smoking is one of the cruelest killers in the world. Until now, not only smokers but second-hand smokers suffer from the poisoned smoke and many diseases resulted from it. Many public places signs that No Smoking, but it doesn't work. However, I insisted that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, smoking is a direct way for suicide and murder. Smokers hurt their own lung and at the same time, the people around the smoker also breathe in the poisoned gas especially in the restaurants. Just imagine the situation that you are eating your delicious meal, but the table beside you give out a choking smoke, do you still have the mood to enjoy the meal? Then, based on many surveys, smoking can result in many kinds of disease which lead to death. Even the new-born babies are influenced by smoking. So who want to take a risk of getting deadly disease? Many men form a habit of smoking at a certain time, such as after the meal. They can't help doing that and the other people have no choice but to tolerate it. Above all, what should we do? As I think, the government should set a series of rules about smoking ban. Perhaps more importantly, we citizens should have an aware of reducing the smoke. It's being of great importance that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at the country. Only with the power of law and moral, can we enjoy a no-smoking environment during our dinner or anything other.
