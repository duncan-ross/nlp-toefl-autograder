I agree with the voice that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons I think so. The One is that I think the smoke of tobaccos is make dishes not delicious. If I was the cook, I want to eat the dishes on the best condition. I do not smoke and I do not like the smoke. So I think, for who do not like smoke, the smoke is the bad thing which the condition make bad. I do not know how smokers feel about the smoke, but there are more people who are not smoking than people who are smoking. In the stands of the shop, for make the restaurant better, we should considerate about majority. And the other reason is that we cannot separate the area for smoking and for no smoking in perfectly. Some of restaurants separate the area to smoking and no-smoking but I think it is not good. In the many case, the separation do not cover all. So In the seat in no-smoking area but near the smoking area, we feel the smell of the smoke of tobacco. Because of these two reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
