According to my personal opinion, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons to support this topic such as health consequence and economic reason. As we know that smoking is bad for our health. It can cause lung cancer and other dangerous diseases. Smoking also affects our body badly. People will get an older face early more than others who do not smoke. Smoking not only cause negative outcome for person who do it but also affect other people. From many studies, it suggests that people who stay in smoking area receive the same consequence as the smoker. If you smoke, people around you can get a cancer surely. It is not fair for non-smoker because of this condition. In a restaurant area, there are many people in this place both smoker and non-smoker. The law that ban smokings in the public place include a restaurant is good for everyone. For economic reason, it is unnecessary to waste your money with buying a cigarette. Even though, the government receives tax from this business but we should keep money to support other things in our life. To prevent people from bad health and waste their money with buying a cigarette we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
