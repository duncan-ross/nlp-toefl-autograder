Part time job are very important to a college student. They must know how their parents work to pay their tuition. Of course, their parents weren't talk much about their job because they don't want their children to worry much. In Indonesia many parents have their child to study hard to get a better tomorrow. Part time job is very important to college student because they are still asking money from their parents. Many of my friends just asking and asking money from their parents before thinking about their parent's economy. If a college student got part time job, they will decrease their will to spent more money because they are know how difficult to got money by himself / herself. Part time job also give a college student a lesson about responsibility and patience. How they react to their customer, how they react to their boss, and how they manage their time about study and work. It's not just the smart student can get part time job, the boss will need the diligent and honest one. Smart without diligent and honest are null. While diligent and honest without smart still can make something better to this world. That's all thank you.
