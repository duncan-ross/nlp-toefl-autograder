Smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants across the country. There is not a single benefit from the habit that justifies the continuation of an act which endangers not just the smoker's health but also the people physically in close proximity. Smoking has been a social habit since the 18th century, and has undergone several evolutions before being marketed globally and becoming a lucrative business. Smoking is the number one cause for the high rates of lung cancers and other smoke related diseases. Nothing strange about that, if one looks closely at the components of a cigarette. Nicotine, tartar and other harmful chemicals are all packed into this little package which promises a momentary physical "paradise" for its users, and require frequent use if users want to relive this comfortable state. Most people are addicted to it not purely by choice, but by a physical addiction, which is triggered by psychological responses to the withdrawal symptoms if one attempts to quit smoking. People around smokers get what we call "second hand smoke", which researchers say are at least as dangerous as the "first hand smoke" smokers get. Thus, we can see the extended damage that smoking can cause. Smoking is a common tool of social bonding between smokers, which is not to be neglected since smokers form a considerable part of society. Given its large industry, tobacco and cigarette manufacturers are formidable establishments which can be detrimental to economies if they are to be closed down. These are the significant reasons why smoking still exists. We have seen why smoking still persists, even if obvious reasons justify their elimination. Still, advocates against smoking are commonly supported, and smoking is continually being eradicated across the world. Other than restaurants, other places are starting to ban smoking entirely, and this is a good first move towards a cleaner world for all.
