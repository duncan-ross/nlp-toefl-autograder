It is good for college students to have a part-time job. I think this because I have had a part-time job for a long time. In my part-time job, I work as a waitress at Denny's. By working at a restaurant, I can learn a lot about people skills and how to deal with different kinds of people. In the business world, people skills are very important because they help you to be more successful. The better your people skills are, the more successful you will be. Also, many of my friends have part-time jobs too. Some of them are waitresses, but some of them also work at internships which is pretty impressive. I am not ready to work at a real company yet, and right now my job as a waitress is good enough for me. I am lucky enough for my parents to pay for most of my college, so the money I make is mostly just for me. I hope that other college students can be like me and can find part-time work so that they can make some money too. It is very fun to go out with your friends on the weekend, and it is definitely no fun if you cannot go out because you have no money. Waitressing is a good job for every girl to experience at least for a little bit.
