I agree with this statement because college students will be able to have precious experiences through part-time jobs. I think that there are three advantages of working part-time. Firstly, students can come into contact with various people at a part-time job place. They can meet older persons. They will be showed many things which they don't know by seniors. Secondly, students can know the preciousness of money through part-time job. Probably they had used money without considering the value of money deeply when they had got money from their parents. But, they could understand the value of money or the difficulty of earning money only after working by themselves. Thirdly, students will learn important things when working. Through the part-time job, they will realize the importance of working efficiently or supporting each other. I also actually had a very good experience through working myself. I was working as a clerk in Italian restaurant from May last year to March this year. I received strict instruction about service from the chief of the restaurant. I was instructed a lot of things. It's the courtesy which I studied most through work of the restaurant. I think that it is very useful to have mastered courtesy in future. Although I was sometimes scolded by chief, I think it was also valuable experience because I had no opportunity scolded by man other than parents until then. I was able to learn not only the courtesy but also the right language, the attitude toward work, and the importance of cooperating each other. I think that my experience of part-time job will be very useful for employment. So I agree that statement.
