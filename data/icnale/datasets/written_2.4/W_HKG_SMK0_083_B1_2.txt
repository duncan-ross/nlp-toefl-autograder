It is not surprising anymore when seeing people carrying a cigarette in their hands no matter whether they are elderly or even teenagers. Many of the university students are also smoking during their university life. Not surprisingly, students do not think that smoking is unhealthy. The age of first attempt of smoking even shows a dropping trend these days. It is not a healthy scenario. Researchers have proved that cigarettes will emit numerous toxic and hazardous particles which cause serious health problem to smokers and even people around them. Although banning smoking at restaurants, for example, may show disrespect to current smoker, it is still necessary to ban smoke in order to protect the victims of second handed smoke. Government should as well put more effort in promoting a smoke-free city and educating the next generation. Meanwhile, measures in supporting people quitting smoking should not be ignored. Without those measures, easily people will begin smoking again. As a result, stop smoking will become meaningless. In conclusion, I do think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
