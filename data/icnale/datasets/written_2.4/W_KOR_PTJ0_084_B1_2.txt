I disagree on college students to have a part - time job. The essence of college student is to recognize the talent and individuality of each student and to develop him or her. Therefore Students have to just study hard But nowadays many students have a part time job. What they want to have a part time job? Most of the students supply themselves with money for their pleasures. And they give up to pleasures and entertainment. Eventually they didn't save any money so they cause a vicious circle. A number of other people commented that have a part-time job is support to their society life but I disagree on comment. Because student had to work during the daytime and study at night. So they're ruined their college study by part - time job. Of course their didn't have enough money to attend college. They work part-time job to pay for tuition but I think most of students in the college is not poor. So I think that most of students study hard more than have part time job. As mentioned above student is to recognize the talent and individuality of each student and to develop him finally it behooves students to study.
