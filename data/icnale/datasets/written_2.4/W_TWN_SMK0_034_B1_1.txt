Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Many researches have already proven that smoking harm human body including respiratory and nervous system. Therefore, governments in many countries set the law to ban smoking in public areas. But the necessarity of banning smoking completely at all the restaurants remains controversial. Some restaurant owners in Taipei city put a emphasis that their restaurants are smoke-free. And most still are divided into smoking area and non-smoking area, even some do not restrict their customer smoking. Second-hand smoking is the most harmful passage to damage people health. And victims are always those innocent people who don't smoke but around some smokers. So we should restrict the smoking behavior happened at restaurants. But the question is whether restaurants should be regarded as a public area or not. We don't know government has the right to limit owners' way of conduction. In contrast, smokers would consider smoking should belong to the basic human right and law can't intervene into their life. In my eyes, it is not easy to determine the relationship between the restaurant and smoking. Since I still think smoking has no benefits to our health, we should ban this behavior in public areas. As for the legislative aspect, lawmakers have to solve this problem and keep brainstorming.
