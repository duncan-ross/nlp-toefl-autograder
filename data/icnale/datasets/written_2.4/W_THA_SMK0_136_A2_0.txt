From the statement, I think it shouldn't be banned the smoking in all restaurants because there are a lot of people who smoke but the restaurants need a place for smoking, especially it cannot disturb others. For another reason, the restaurants can earn a lot of money from smokers as well as earn from non smokers, so they have to grab both types of customers. Their job is how to keep both of them to still use the service with them. One possible solution that I can notice from many restaurants here already provided special places for smokers such as at the yard, the back of the restaurants, or special rooms. It's very good idea and all smokers and non smokers love that. They can get both of them and all people are satisfied. It's not necessary to ban smoking in all restaurant. The more dangerous of smoking is people do it in public places. This is should be banned rather than in all restaurants. Once I take a mini bus in front of the university and I smelled the cigarette smoke from the driver. Not only me but all passengers got that. We can't breathe and I want to get off the bus but I can't because I have no money left. It's very suffering. So as I said, in the restaurants shouldn't ban smoking, but the public places must ban.
