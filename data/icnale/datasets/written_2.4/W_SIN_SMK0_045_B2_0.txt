I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking has been scientifically proven to be hazardous to the human body due to the toxic chemicals present within the tobacco stick. It is also known that smokers usually suffer from serious and deadly ailments (such as lung cancer) due to their habit of smoking. Also, research has also shown that passive-smokers would also develop such health conditions as they were exposed to the smoke emitted by the lighted stick. It is quite a tragedy that these passive-smokers are usually the innocent family members of habitual smokers. Another negative effect of smoking is the amount of money wasted just to buy a box of cigarettes. Cigarettes are not cheap; the price of one box can start from $10. Hence, smokers are actually wasting their money on something that would eventually destroy their body. Therefore, the habit of smoking provides no benefits to an individual and the society. In fact, the habit of smoking has proved to be detrimental to the smoker himself and also the people around him. At worse, it can lead to the development of lung cancer and eventually, death. Thus, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants as it would negatively affect diners who are non-smokers.
