Nowadays, it is becoming more and more common to see college students taking up part-time jobs while juggling with their school work and other activities. Recently, several fast food restaurants like McDonalds have also posted job offers to students. Why is this trend becoming more prevalent in society and is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Personally, I agree that it is essential for college students to have a part-time job some time in their schooling life. Firstly, it provides them with an experience before they step into the working society after graduate. By participating in such jobs, they are able to gain insights to the working world and can pick up skills which will be applicable in the future. Furthermore, they can expect what future jobs may be like and hence, may motivate them to study harder and achieve better. Secondly, it teaches them proper time-management. By taking up a part-time job, they will learn to prioritize their events and thus learn to be responsible and independent individuals. These moral values cannot be learnt from textbooks, but experienced from work and interactions. Hence, college students are able to benefit if they were to take up a part-time job.
