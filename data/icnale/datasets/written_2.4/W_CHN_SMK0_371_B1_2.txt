First of all, smoking is harmful. It does harm to not only the man who is smoking, but also those people around. They take in the poisonous smoke either. This smoke may raise the rate of lung cancer. Every year, thousands of people around the world have passed away because of lung cancer. The real killer is just smoking. Second, smoking in public sets a bad example for young people. They may think smoking is cool. What's more, smoking in public brings some environmental problems, such as the poisonous smoke in air, and the rest of cigarettes around the ground. This is bad for environmental protection. Also, in many places, there are special rooms for smokers. They can smoke in an isolated place rather than smoke in public, if they couldn't control themselves. With these rooms, we can avoid second-handed smoke, and have better health. Overall, smoking is harmful with no benefits. It does harm to smokers and some persons around them. Smoking is just a waste of health and money. Taking everyone's health into consideration, smoking should be forbidden in public places. Also, maybe we can advise the smokers we know to abandon smoking.
