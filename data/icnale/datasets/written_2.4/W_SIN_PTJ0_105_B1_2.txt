Personally, I do not think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The importance must be compared relative to something. Why is it important? Is it important because the student needs it to support himself and his family? Or is it important because the student needs to buy the upcoming Chanel bag? If it is the former, it will be considered important. Also, the student must also be able to make sure that he/she is able to deal with the amount of school work and have good time management before he/she decides to commit to a part-time job. For example, I had a part time job when I was in NUS year 1. I realized that my grades actually suffered for the first semester because I was too preoccupied with my part time job. Although it was a job at a bookstore and I enjoyed working there and interacting with my colleagues, I had to make a decision to quit the job. It was a job that was important to me because I do not receive any allowances from my parents, hence I had to make money on my own in order to purchase school books, afford transportation and daily expenses. Fortunately, I was eligible to apply for bursaries so my life is much easier. I can't wait to graduate so I can get a full time job and support my family!
