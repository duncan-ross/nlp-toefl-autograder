Nowadays, having a part-time job has been a trend among college or university students. Some consider that it is important for college student to have part-time jobs; while others hold the opposite attitude towards it. In my opinion, I think it is crucial for college students to get a part-time job, and I have several reasons why. To begin with, by doing the work assigned by the boss, students can gain experiences from their part-times. During work time, a student may face a lot of difficulties such as troublesome customers, lazy and irresponsible colleagues, mean and strict supervisors, to name but a few that they might not confront at schools or homes. From dealing with these difficulties, a student can acquire valuable skills on interacting with people properly, finding the best solution to solve a problem, the bright or dark side of human, and among others which later on will definitely be useful when they enter society. In addition to gaining experiences, students can also earn some money in order to help their parents pay their tuition. What's more, there might be extra money for students to spend meanwhile they don't have to ask their parents for more money. Doing a part-time job is certainly something that a student will benefit from. Of course, there are drawbacks for college students to do part-time jobs such as declining grades or lack of concentration on courses. However, I believe that a student is mature enough to determine what one's priority is and enjoy both his or her college life as well as part-time job!
