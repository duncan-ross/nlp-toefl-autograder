Diners are people who feel dizzy and craze for food. Three times a day, hungry people walk into a restaurant. After the order and chewing, they get salvation and feel relaxed. Another kind of people also seek for salvation and relaxation... they take cigarettes out of their pockets, burning it and smoking. Suddenly smokers would feel saved while diners bothered. For non-smokers, the smell of cigarettes makes them feel sick. It is too strong that offends their noses. Not to mention when they are dining, enjoying the aroma of foods. The smell covering the taste of food may be irritating. Like coffee, the physic mechanism of smoking relaxation is to excite the nerves in brain, making them thrilled. But the first time the nerves are excited through smoking, you would feel nausea since it is never done before. You may not need the excitement all the time, but there are always smokers around! Even in the restaurant, or the sanctuary, there are full of smokers! The smokes just make smokers out of appetites. No matter in which country, smoking inside the room would be bothersome, not to mention when you need relaxation in restaurants. If you are smoking, OK, please go outside or to the reserved section. Isn't it a mutual respect for the right of relaxation?
