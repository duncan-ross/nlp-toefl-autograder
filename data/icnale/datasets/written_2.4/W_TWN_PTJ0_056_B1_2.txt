Nowadays it is a common for college students to have a part-time job. Some students work part-time to pay their own tuition because their family cannot afford it. The others may just earn more pocket money for entertainment. But there are arguments whether it is appropriate for college students to have a part-time job. The opponent worry that part-time job would interfere the study. However, as far as I am concerned, having a part-time job is good for students' work career. The reason why I think having a part-time job is good for students' career are following. First, under the educational system of Taiwan, every student study hard and learn a lot of professional knowledge. But the shortage is that our students lack of team spirit because they studied alone throughout their learning career. By having a part-time job, they can learn to cooperate with people from different department or people in different age. University does not teach this, but it does important and helpful when taking a job. Furthermore, book and teacher offer knowledge while the society offers real experience. The school life is quite different from the real world. It is a good opportunity for students to previously get some realistic experience in taking a job. They may learn to be polite, humble, correct attitude and the most important, the better way to solve unpredictable problems. Last but not least, students will exactly realize the difficulty of earning money, which makes them more grateful toward what they've own. Although it is important for students to study their professional majors, but it is also important to plan their future. As a student, I think learning is not only in books, but also in real life. After all, we live in the real word, not in the knowledge.
