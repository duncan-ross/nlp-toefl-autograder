I agree to great extent that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. As there is non-smoker using the same vicinity together with the smokers, everyone should be mindful on their shared spaces so that there is no disturbance causes to the people around. Smoking in places such as restaurants could pollute the air quality, which could causes uncomfortable experience to other users nearby. For instance, the effect of smoking restaurant which are mainly air-conditioned space, it would tap the exhaust smoke from the smokers within the restaurant which give off unpleasant smells. This could affect those people who could possibility find it uncomfortable to be in a restaurants that fills with the smell of smoking. Nonetheless, it creates unhappiness of non-smokers about the restaurant's environment and the dining experience will be greatly affected. There had been measures taken to manage this issues by the government, as they activity encourage smokers to smoke only at designated areas of the coffee shop or shopping malls. Therefore, this effort helps to reducing the contact between non-smokers and smokers. Hence, it has creates a better air quality within shops and public spaces. However, it might have causes difficulties to smokers to smoke freely in anywhere they would wanted. In conclusion, we have to strive for a balance society whereby smoker and non-smokers could harmoniously enjoy the use of common space such as restaurants. By providing specific venue for smoking and encourage understanding from smokers to accept the changes, thus it would build better air quality in our restaurants.
