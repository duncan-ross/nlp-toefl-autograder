 College students are a group of special kids. They are independent and have a particular view to our society. To such a group of people, having a part time job is a thing that can express their values. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are three reasons. At first, having a part time job can make college students know more about our society. With the development of society, competition becomes more and more fierce. How to have a good ability to do more, part time jobs give a chance to take advance to step into the society, and learn more to be a businessman. And second, having a part time job can help a lot of students whose families are not very well. Maybe it can make them go to university, and have a better meal. What's more? Having a part time job can give you confidence and a sense of accomplishment. It would be important for one who wants to grow up. So, in my opinion, having a part time job is important for college students. And it can give us more than we can think. If you want to have a part time job, ok, take action!
