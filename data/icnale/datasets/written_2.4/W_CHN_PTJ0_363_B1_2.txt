As we all know, college education plays a very important role in helping college students to gain working knowledge and abilities. In college, students have much more flexible time than middle school students and can spend a colorful life. Some students choose to study and some choose to take part in some parties in their free time. In my opinion, it's important for us college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, having a part-time job can help students to gain some money so we can pay our college fee and living expanses on our own instead of tending to their parents for financial support. This can also release our families' financial burden. Secondly, we can gain much social life experience and working knowledge, which will help us getting a better understanding of the out-campus world and more advantage while looking for a good job after graduation. Nowadays, most companies value the working experience a lot while inviting applications for jobs. So if you have more working experience, you will have more chances to get a job while competing with other applicators. Thirdly, having a part-time job can help us students to nurturance the good habit of austerity. Most of us live rely on our parents before attending college. We don't have a chance to experience the hardships in making money. However, when we get a job and can make money ourselves, we will realize the value of money and learn how to spend it more wisely. This will be very useful for us when we step into society. So if you have enough time and want to make yourself adapt to the society more easily, looking for a part-time job is a good choice.
