With students in university only a few years away from graduation and finding work, as well as the need to start being financially independent from their parents, it is indeed important for college students to partake in a part-time job whilst studying. It is known that a typical college student spends about two to five years in their university pursuing a degree before moving onto the workplace. As such, their time in the university may be the last opportunity for them to pick up some relevant skills which may be useful in their potential working environment. Such skills, such as the work place procedures or dynamics, are often not taught in educational institutes; hence some college students choose to take on a part-time job or internship so as to immerse themselves in a working environment and learn more about their potential job scope at the same time. In fact, certain companies may even extend a full-time job offer to those college students who work part-time if the performance of the students had been impressive. In addition, the start of college somewhat indicates the imminent start of adulthood for many college students as well. Although it may be difficult for university students to be totally financially independent from their parents, many parents may start to gradually reduce the amount of pocket money they give to their child once they start college. As such, since expenses are not likely to reduce during college, in fact in may even increase, it is hence important for college students to work part-time in order to earn some money and support themselves. In conclusion, it is clearly beneficial for college students to take on a part-time job as they will eventually become working adults and experiences during part-time jobs will better prepare them for the future.
