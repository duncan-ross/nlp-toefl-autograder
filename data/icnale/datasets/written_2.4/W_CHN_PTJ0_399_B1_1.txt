 Nowadays, quantities of university students do part time job for different aims. For me, I think part time job is necessary. I joined the Peoples Liberty Army two years ago. It is necessary for us university students that we should get some experience before we got into the society. The two years taught me a lot when I was in the army. It helped me to get rid of a lot of bad habits what I have before. When I left, I got lots of wealth. Not for other purposes, but for our future we should get the experiences what we can get in part time jobs. By part time jobs, we can learn to be in harmony with others. Any way, it is very good for our professions that we get in the future. Also, we can get money using our ability for the first time in our life. As we all know, many students cannot afford their affairs easily. I am one of them. I have to agree that money is one of my purposes joining in the Peoples Liberty Army. I will get ninety thousand RMB for the follow year. Job can really help. So why not get a pat time job if we have the time?
