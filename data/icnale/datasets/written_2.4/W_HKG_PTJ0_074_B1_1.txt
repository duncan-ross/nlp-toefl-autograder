It's not important for university students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs reduce students' time to study. University life is not easy, especially for the students who want to get a good academic result at the end; 24 hours for study may not enough for them. If it's true, how can a student have extra time for part-time job? Part-time jobs make student less concentrate at their study. Applying part-time job may not be successful; students may search a lot of information of job recruitment, apply a lot of jobs, and go to interview one after another. It not only wastes students' time, but also wastes their energy. Somebody may argue that job experience is important for job-seeking. If it was true, university should change its name to job training center. The main concern for university students should be knowledge chase, and this is also what employers consider. Part-time jobs experience does not impress employers in good ways, as opposite, employers consider students with part-time job experience had less concentration at their study, especially for who had bad academic result. Some university require students to do a job, which is related to their course, before they graduates. That's true, but it must be a full time job, such as internship, not a part-time job.
