Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. Restaurants in general have two types of seating available: smoking and non-smoking. Such an arrangement is fundamentally due to legislative reasons such as the prohibition of smoking indoors. However, this also gives customers a choice on where they would like to be seated. In the smoking areas of the restaurants, customers are generally more relaxed and at ease because they are free to smoke as they wish. Smoking is after all, a personal lifestyle choice. As such, why should anyone be deprived of the right to make a choice for himself? If we are concerned that secondhand smoke may irritate other restaurant guests, then there may be a problem with the seating arrangement of the restaurant. The smoking and non-smoking areas should not be too closely located so as to respect the choices of both groups of customers. There is no reason to ban smoking in restaurants just because we want to ensure that non-smokers are not affected by the secondhand smokes. Such a move would be as extreme as saying smoking should be allowed anywhere and everywhere so as to accommodate the needs of smokers. I firmly believe that there should always exist a balance between any decisions.
