 It is a factor that as a college student, we are not working. But are we lack of money? The answer must be no to a huge number of students. Yes, we are using our parent's money, they are glad to give us money, and we are happy to accept it, both of us take this phenomenon for granted. But, the money that comes from our parents isn't our own money. As for me, I will feel guilty if I waste money that comes from my parents, I will feel very uncomfortable if I use that money to buy presents for my friends, even if my parents agree me to do so. Many students will ask: if you don't use your parent's money, who are they earning money for? Why are they working so hard to earn money? Will their efforts be in vain if you don't accept their money? it may be right to some scale. However, if your parents don't have the ability to earn money? In fact, as a college student, we have the ability to earn money, why don't we do that? College life will be dreary if we don't make full use of our spare time. So, why not try to take a part-time job? Taking a part-time job can enlarge our knowledge of the society, and at the same time, we are making preparation for our future job. Therefore, I think it important for us college students to have a part-time job.
