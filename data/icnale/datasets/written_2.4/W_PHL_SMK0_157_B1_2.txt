I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because it is inappropriate to smoking while someone is trying to eat a meal. A person who is not smoker can inhale the smoke and get second hand smoke which is a health risk. Smoking is already a bad addiction for many people, but it is also bad for the people that do not smoke. Many people today are dying because of lung cancer caused by smoking and or second hand smoke. Someone that smokes knows the risks of smoking and second hand smoke and therefore they should be aware who to smoke by and when it is appropriate to smoke and when it is not. Banning smoking in restaurants and other public places may sound easy but it is a challenge for some people because they can't even go a half hour without having a cigarette. Smokers say that they cannot stop smoking because they have been doing it for years and it is an addiction. They also say that the places where they usually smoke the most are in the restaurants, bars and clubs. They smoke here the most because they spend a couple of hours in these places.
