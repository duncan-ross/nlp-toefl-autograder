Smoking is not a good habit. It costs a lot of money and will do great harm to smokers' health. But there never lacks heavy smokers. Not only do them smoke at home, but they also smoke a lot in public places, such as coffee cafe, hall, church, etc. I think it is not so appreciate. Public places are for all so smoking there is unbearable for the bad smell. What's more, it will pollute the air and make others to do a second smoking when nobody is aware of it. So, I am strongly against for smoking in public. From my point of view, I think smoking is completely a bad habit because it brings us no benefits. It just like drugs, people are addicted to it and are damaged by it slowly. Watch those who die from lung disease, most of them are heavy smokers. So we should give up smoking for our family and health. Smoking is never important and no one will laugh at you if you can not smoke. Finally, what I want to say is that if someday we want to smoke, please think that what we will do will cause such damage.
