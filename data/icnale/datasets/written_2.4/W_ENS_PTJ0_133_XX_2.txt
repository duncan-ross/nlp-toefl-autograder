I can't agree with that statement at all. Many college students that I know and also myself when I was a student, worked out of necessity. Aside from compulsory internships during summer vacation periods, the rest of the working time was only important because we needed the dollars. In my case, I was paying part of my way through college and was also attempting to get my student loans decreased rather than face a huge debt as soon as I graduated. If the statement was referring specifically to working out of necessity which it is not, then I could agree. The most important thing in college is doing well because it's a cutthroat world out here in the real world and we need every edge we can get. A part-time job is only important if financial circumstances dictate that it is a necessity or it is linked to some form of internship that will assist with future job prospects. Unfortunately, due to the current economic climate, part-time jobs are becoming more and more of a necessity otherwise we will see fewer and fewer new college enrolments and graduations. Many students, prospective and current are feeling the economic pressure that has been brought about by the near global financial collapse.
