Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer, emphysema, and heart desease ; that can shorten our life by ten years or more and that the habit can spend cost thousands of dollars' smoker a year, it does not make many people leave the habit, In fact there are still many people do it. Although we often find no smoking writing in many places, many people do not pay any attention. As we know that our goverment ban smoking in all public place, but there are still many people break the role, so Should the goverment ban smoking in the restaurant? I think yes, because restaurant is one of public place, it means that the visitor is not only from smokers but also non-smokers. There are many reasons of ban smoking in the restaurant : Passive smoker are also exposed to the smoke. Families that visit the restaurant accompanied by their children, it means that their children are also exposed to smoke, The restaurant will become stuffy with smoke, No fresh air inside the restaurant, or protects non-smoker from risk of heart deseases, cancer and respiratory problem. The smoke of cigarettes is dangerous to smokers and non smokers and may cause serious diseases. If we ban smoking it will increase visitor to the restaurant (as non smokers also will pay to visit).
