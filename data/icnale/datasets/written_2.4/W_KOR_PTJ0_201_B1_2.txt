I think a part time job is very important for college students to help in completing our daily needs and college's administration, more jobs we can get as private teacher, shop assistant, and etc. Because, to have a part time job can make us become independent. A part time job, it can help us to spend spare time, because the lecture does not always full time. Sometimes there is also a lecturer who was unable to attend, so we have a lot of free time that many if not used properly. But we must pay attention to our health. We still have to learn from the work concerned. But more than time is free, until we should be clever content time free by a part time job. But more people disagree about its important for college students to have a part time job, because it can disturb study for college student. Some people have an opinion about its important for college students to have a part time job, because we can get the money not science. That study is more important than a job, because we needs awake healthy, but opinion for college students because time is busy. It's well that free time. It's depends us to repair our time to make it balance between work and study.
