I agree. At first, college students need money. We want to play with our friends, go shopping and travel. When we want to do it, we shouldn't depend on our parents. So we need to have a part-time job to earn. Second, when we'll have a job, it is useful for us to experience in a part-time job. Even if we are a part-time, consumers deal with the employee. So we can have a sense of responsibility. Third, we can have good relationship with our coworker. It sometimes helps us. Forth, we may learn skills from a part-time job. There are not skills not to learn. In fact, I have had a part-time job since I enrolled N. I. T. I'm working at a cram school where I studied in high school. Since I started to work, I learned many things and am learning. I can remember the academic knowledge to teach my students. I learned how to call and use Word and Excel. When I'm working, I'm wearing a suit. When I'll have a job, maybe I'll wear a suit. I'm accustomed to wear a suit. Finally, I'm enjoying working. Working is fun. If you have a part-time job, you'll know it.
