I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Maybe it would sound unfair and hard of people who smoke. Personally, as a nonsmoker, I strongly believe that smoking should be prohibited at restaurants. The main reasons are as follow. First, I consider that second-hand smoking is worse than direct smoking. If someone that is a nonsmoker, they have the right to be healthy. However, by the second-hand smoking, this nonsmoker can be seriously affected. Considering the nonsmoker's health, smoking shouldn't be allowed in public places. Another reason is the smoke and the smell. It is really bothering smelling cigarette and being affected by the smoke especially when you are eating. The restaurants are places where food is served and the environment should be thoroughly considered. Finally, smoking should be banned at restaurants because it is a place where everybody can come and go. Smoking is especially bad for kids and pregnant women. We cannot restrict kids and pregnant from coming to restaurants, so it would be good for smokers to stop smoking at the restaurants. The health is the most precious thing we should care about. Smoking doesn't affect only the smoker but also people around.
