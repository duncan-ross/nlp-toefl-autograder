There are many people addicted to smoking around the world. So far some restaurants don't banned smoking to satisfy with those people who like to smoke. Personally, I don't like the smell of smoke, but I consider that it's too serious to be completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. There are some ways that restaurants can do to satisfy with both who smoke and who don't smoke. The first way is if the restaurants don't want to ban smoking, then they should set another area for those non-smoking people so that all the people would willing to go eating there. For the restaurants which don't want to set another fresh place, then they should follow the second way. The second way is they should warn the people that their restaurants welcome the people who smoke and they don't set any extra area for non-smoking people. If they do so, they not only keep the non-smoking people from going to their restaurants getting disturbed but also cash in form those who smoke. The restaurant can be designated for smoking people. It's a liberal world, so we shouldn't set any limit to the restaurants don't want to ban the smoking people. The restaurants can make decision by themselves that which consumers they want meeting their needs. We consumers also can choose which restaurants we would like to dine at.
