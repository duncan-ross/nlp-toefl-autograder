I agree with the statement. Smoking is not good thing for people. Smoking affects not only people who smoke but also people who are by the smoker. Smoking is harmful for people health. It is said that people who have smoked for a long time are likely to get a cancer. Once they start to smoke, people seems to stop smoking. But smoking costs people a lot of money. And people who smoke waste time. People who often smoke seem to get stress when they don't smoke for a long time. So it seems that smoker have less "shuchuryoku" than non-smoker. In addition, it seems that smoker can't run longer time than non-smoker because smoking has our bless equipment bad effect. So most of professional sport player don't smoke. Sometimes famous actors look very cool when he smoke in TV drama. So there are many people who think that smoker is cool. But smoke is not good. In many foreign countries, smoking is banned very strictly. At all side of smoke box, there are large size sentences and pictures about smoke harm in many countries around the world. There are countries in which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, too. I want to go to the restaurant in which there are many people who are smoking. If the restaurant's food is very delicious, smoking makes the restaurant smelly. So it makes foods bad. And not only people who want to smoke but also non-smoker who dislike smoke smell come to the restaurants. Children, older people and woman who will bear a baby a few month after also want to come to there. But it is harmful for them especially. So for all of people who want to go to the restaurant and enjoy eating and drinking, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
