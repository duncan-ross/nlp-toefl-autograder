Smoking should be banned to all restaurants in our country. It is very annoying to be surrounded by the smoke smell. It has been noted that passive smoking is much more dangerous than active smoking, because in the former case, you inhale the smoke emitted out by a smoker. In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide—without the government's help—if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers, but the ultimate issue is choice. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries. The decrease in customers and subsequent loss of revenue has far-reaching effects on employers. Banning smoking in all public restaurants violates this principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers. Like the black Southerner turned away because of racial segregation, the smoker is unfairly treated. Sadly, just when our government claims to be whisking away the clouds of smoke, it is legislating a cloud of discrimination.
