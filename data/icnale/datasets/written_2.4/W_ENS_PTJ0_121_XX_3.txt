College is a time when young people should expand their minds, and their range of experiences. I believe that college students need to be independent to do this. To be truly independent, however, they cannot rely on their parents. This applies to accommodation, cleaning, and of course money. Independence requires responsibility. The ability to earn money and pay for the things that students enjoy (like stylish clothes or all-you-can drink deals at the local bar) is essential in acquiring this responsibility. However, it is the responsibility that is gained by turning up for work at a set time and following directions properly that far outweighs the monetary benefits that a part time job during college brings. As a young person becomes more responsible, they also become more mature. Maturity, along with independence and initiative, is what all employers look for in potential applicants, and it is essential for dealing with the ups and downs that come with a full time job. College students should also remember that the skills they pick up while working part time jobs can make an average resume look great. The maturity and sense of self-esteem I gained by working various part time jobs during my college years prepared me well for my professional career. I believe it is not merely "important" that college students have a part-time job: it is essential.
