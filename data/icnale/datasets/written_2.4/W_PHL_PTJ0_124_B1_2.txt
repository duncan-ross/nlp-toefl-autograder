I strongly believe that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs especially those related with their degree / major in order to broaden their knowledge in the field they're in. It is not only work experience that the student can benefit or get, students would also learn on how to earn money they worked har d for to sustain their needs, help their parents financially, especially those in the middle and lower class families who are financially unstable. Likewise, there are students who are financially stable but they don't want to bother their parents for some reason so they work and at the same time, study. There are students who want to buy the things they want to but they don't want to bother their parents so they work to earn the money they need. There are many reasons why college students get part-time jobs while studying and some of them are stated above. We don't know why students work while studying, but mostly, they work to help their parents financially AND if they wish to apply for jobs in the near future, they would have an advantage that they have work experience related to their degree.
