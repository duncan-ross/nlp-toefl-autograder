It is very important for college students to have a part-time job so that they can gain some knowledge about the real world and gain some experience in business before they graduate. I am a study abroad student from Australia, and in my home country it is fairly uncommon for kids to have part-time jobs while they attend school. This is because the government shoulders part of the costs of our tuition, so most of us don't need to work to have enough money to go to school and live. But here in the U. S., most of my friends seem to have a part-time job, and I think this is because the government does not provide enough support for the students who need it. No matter what the case may be, I don't think it is right that students should have to do anything and simply go to school and study. However, I don't think this is going to change anytime soon, and if anything, I think that more students will be finding part-time work in the coming years. I love my new university I love studying abroad, but this is one aspect of American culture that I do not quite feel comfortable with.
