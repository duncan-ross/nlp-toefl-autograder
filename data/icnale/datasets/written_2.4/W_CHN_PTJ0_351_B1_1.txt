Nowadays, more and more college students are told to do some part-time jobs if they are free. I think it is very important for college students to do so. To do some part-time jobs benefit college students a lot. College students can gain some social experience from part-time jobs. In China, students are far isolated from the society. Growing up with too much homework to do, too many tests to past, students have little chance to gain social experience during the secondary schools, which is very important when they graduate. Part-time jobs provide the chances. By doing some part-time jobs, college students will know more about current conditions of the job and knowledge that can't learn from the books but the jobs. College students can get some abilities from part-time jobs. A counter in the supermarket will be more careful and a salesman or salesgirl can learn to communicate with various people and be more patient. Each job requires abilities, which will help students become more and more excellent. What's more, students can get some money by doing part-time jobs. It can not only lighten the burden of their parents but also make students more independent. Besides, they will learn the hard to get money so that they will be grateful to their parents and won't waste money. Study hard and do some part-time jobs, then the campus life will be wonderful.
