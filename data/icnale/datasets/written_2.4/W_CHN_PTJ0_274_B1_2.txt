 Nowadays, part-time job is more and more fashion among the senior high school students and college students. In my opinions, I think it is a very good phenomenon and should be encouraged in our society. Almost of the college students are beyond 18 years old, which means that they have the ability to feed themselves. I think having a part-time job in vacations a excellent chance for us to make some money. These will reduce parents' burden and make yourself feel good and successful. When using the money you earned by yourself, you would feel proud and relaxable. It is also a lesson that tell you making money is not easy as you image. You should make a lot of effort to make money which you think is so little. Then you will be more thrifty and won't use money promiscuous. The most important is that you will get a lot of experiences, which will lead you be more skillful. Experience is so important which can't be measured by money. It is so precious that will give a powerful hand to your future. We will find a job easier than those who haven't any experiences and could avoid so many mistakes which rookies are always make. To conclude, whatever for now or future, it is very necessary for us to have a part-time job when we are idle.
