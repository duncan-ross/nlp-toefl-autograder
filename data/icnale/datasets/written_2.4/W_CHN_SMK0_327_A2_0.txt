smoking is one of bad habit that I hate most. When a smoker burns a cigarette, he begin to hurt himself. And if there is someone staying around him, he is smoking the second-hand smoke. Especially in public occasion, smoking maybe results in an even serious affection. That situation is always seen in most restaurants. Drinking and smoking seem to the most usual things on the restaurants' tables. However, there is not everyone want to smoking, and someone who cannot stand the smoking maybe in the restaurant. Consequently, I tend to Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. After all, the restaurant is public place. It is difficult to know whether everyone here doesn't mind your smoking here. It should be also considered that if smoking is really completely banned, what affection it can make to the smokers. Actually their smoking on table, in most case, is only a habit, not a necessary thing. Usually, seldom do they go on smoking when they are told not to smoke in the restaurant. So it won't result in much trouble for the smokers. Through the analysis between both sides of the smokers and non-smokers, I agree with the point that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
