I feel strongly that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Much as I empathize with smokers, the act of smoking concerns affects not just the smoker but also those around him. Taking into account that restaurants are public places with patrons from different walks of life and different age groups, smoking should be banned. Firstly, the act of smoking produces toxic gases which are detrimental to health. Research has shown that people do die from second-hand smoking, that is, inhaling the smoke of cigarettes though they themselves are non-smokers. In addition, it may cause discomfort to others who may not like the smell of cigarette smoke. These negative influences that smoking has on the health of others support my stand that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. In Singapore, non-smoking areas and smoking areas are clearly marked out to cater to smokers and non-smokers. However, such an effort is insufficient as smoke may eventually still go over to the non-smoking areas. The best solution would be to ban smoking entirely at dining areas. Besides the health effects of smoking, there may be other consequences too. Restaurants serve food to its customers, and the ash from the cigarette smoke may contaminate the food. Food hygiene could thus be potentially compromised. Nevertheless, I do understand that it is tempting for smokers to have a cigarette after a meal. They could always excuse themselves from the restaurant and smoke elsewhere. There is no need to allow smoking in restaurants to cater to their needs at the expense of other non-smokers. In all, smoking should be banned in all restaurants due to the unpleasant effects it brings to non-smokers. The welfare of non-smokers should not be compromised for the convenience of smokers.
