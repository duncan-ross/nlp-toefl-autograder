In my opinion, smoking in the restaurants has to prohibit for non-smoking people. I think smokers have to think for other people. Although, seats separate smoking area and non-smoking area in restaurant, smoke can't intercept perfectly. There are two reasons why I think forbid smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke is very bad to people. In restaurant, there are not only smokers. There are babies, children, old people and non-smokers. For them, smokers don't permit smoking in the restaurants. That is the first reason smoking prohibit in the restaurants. Second, it is not good for reasons of sanitation. Some smokers spit on the floor and flick the ashes off a cigarette. Smell is disgusting. I think some smokers don't like smell also. That is the second reason smoking forbid in the restaurants. In conclusion, I think smoking in the restaurants has to prohibit for other people and it is bad for reasons of sanitation. In addition, smoking in the restaurant is banned legally. Many people don't know about that. For all of us, smoking in the restaurant has to prevent more strongly. Smokers have to care him or herself because smoking is so bad for health. That's why I think smoking have to forbid for us.
