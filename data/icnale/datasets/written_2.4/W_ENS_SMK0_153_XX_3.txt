This has already been a welcome introduction in many parts of the USA and I agree one hundred percent with the bans. I strongly suggest that Japan follow suit and stay abreast of modern health concerns. It can only reduce insurance costs and decrease the extremely high risks to people that don't smoke, when they are forced to inhale chemicals that can kill them. I have only been to Japan a few times but every time I come, I frequently dine out and have visited many fine restaurants around Tokyo. While I have noticed that there are smoking and non-smoking sections in many of the up-market restaurants that I have frequented, I don't feel that this is adequate because there is no guarantee whatsoever that a small percentage of cigarette fumes will not drift my way. Despite the best exhaust systems or segregating patrons into smaller glassed in rooms, I still feel uncomfortable and would much prefer it if the Japanese Government just issued smoking bans outright and put a lot of non-smoker's minds at ease. Most countries have legislation and regulations regarding poisonous chemicals and also the disposal of harmful wastes. Cigarette smoke is a harmful waste and needs to be regulated along with all other poisons.
