These days, there are a lot of college students who spend their time with a part-time job. Of course, some people are worrying about them for they do not have enough time to concentrate on their studying. However, I agree with the importance of college students having a part-time job. There are two reasons for this argument: significance of getting work experience and realizing importance of money. First of all, students can get involved in social experience through their part-time job. This experience is very important since they can learn how to cooperate with others and how to deal with diverse situations. For example, when I worked for a sandwich store, there were six coworkers with me and we always had to get along with each other to achieve our goal. Of course, we had some difficult time sometimes since our opinions always had differences. However, we went through all of the problems together and after six months, I felt like I made a great social network as well as work skills. Second, part-time job has positive aspect in that students can realize how important earning and spending money appropriately. Since many students have been supported by their parents for a long time, they cannot plan their spending well and it causes a lot of problems such as overspending. Therefore, earning money would be a great chance to understand how to manage their own money. In fact, one of the surveys said that over than fifty percent of parents answered that their children changed in spending money after their part-time job experience. To conclude, it is very important for college students to get involved in part-time job to get social experience and get to know how to manage their own money.
