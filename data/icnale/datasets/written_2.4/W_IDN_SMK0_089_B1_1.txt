Nowadays, there are many people like smoking, not only man but also woman. Some of them fell nice and relax by smoking and also can raise many ideas. But, in the fact, smoking isn't good for our healthy; it causes many risks, such as blindness, stroke, heart attacks, osteoporosis, and cancer. The risk is caused by the ingredients of cigarette. They really dangerous for our healthy. That's way, I agree if the government ban smoking in common area such as restaurant. There are many reasons for this opinion, first is to keep the nutrition and the sterilize of food in the restaurant, because the smoke of cigarette causes air pollution in the restaurant, so it make the air isn't comfortable and the customer will fell disappointed. The second reason is not all people like smoking. Then, the smoker must respect to the other who does not like smoking, because both of active smoker and passive smoker is worse effect of passive smoker. Passive smoker who only inhale of smoke cigarette. The third reason is to decrease the high level of risk smoking, because as we know smoking causes many risks and can shorten our life. In the fact, smoking is right of every one and it does not always have bad effect. Some of people said that they are smoking to raise an idea and exercise their brain in imagination or studying. More over, who is addicted by cigarette, of course he/she can't left smoking although at once or moment. So, the conclusion is the government must give certain place to smoker especially in common place.
