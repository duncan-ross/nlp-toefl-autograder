They are not at the mercy of one and they must act according to the situation and they must be good relationship. They can learn caused by a part-time job. And college students must meet friends or boy-friend. But recently the price of the food is usually above 5000 won. And if they want to watch the movie, it is 9000 won. College students also like to drink coffee while talking but this coffee also more than 3000 won. So they are always short of money. But their parents cannot give a lot of money, so they should be part-time job. So it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
