Firstly, I totally agree with the point. As we all know, smoking is a bad habit. Is there any advantages of smoking can be shown? The answer is obvious No. Therefore, smoking should completely banned at all the public place, especially in the restanrants. Secondly, let's analyse the disadvantages to the people who are sitting or standing around the smokers. If a person who are smoking, it is not avoid letting the seconghand smoking happen. It is very uncomfortable to inhale the smoke of a cigarette smoker. The restaurant is a limited room. When we are together with a smoker who are smoking, the smoke he exhales fills our lungs and also makes our eyes water. We are not smoker, but we are force to breath smoke-filled air. It is unfair to us. So, smoking in public should be banned altogether, and the restaurant was included. We know that breathing smoke regularly, as in cigarette and other tobacco smoking, leads to increased rates of lung cancer in a dose dependent manner. It was said by the expert that tobacco smoke including secondhand smoke may also contribute to non-lung cancers more than preriously thought. Finally, for the sake of everybody's health, I suggest that smoking should complete banned at all the restaurants in the country.
