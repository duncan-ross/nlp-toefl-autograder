It is obvious that university students should have a part-time job due to the following three reasons. Firstly, students need money. Nowadays, Hong Kong is suffering from inflation. If students live without any income, they cannot have a normal life with friends as they need to pay for the admission fee. Secondly, it is a great way to broadening their horizon. They will meet a lot of different people while working including bosses, customers, team leaders and so on. Most importantly, they can get the experience of communication which cannot be taught by the school. Finally, it is one of the necessary parts in the student resume. Recently, nearly every student in Hong Kong has a degree especially there are lots of asso, ive, Hong Kong space and others. A degree can be got simply to whom willing to pay. Therefore, getting a degree cannot represent that you can get the job you want. The job experience represents that how much the company need to give for training a newcomer. The less the company gives, the greater chance you can get the job. Overall, getting a part-time job equals getting money, friend, experience and better future. University students should have a part-time job.
