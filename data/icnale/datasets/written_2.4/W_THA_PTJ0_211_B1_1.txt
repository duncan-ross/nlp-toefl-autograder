I think it's very important to have a part-time job for college students because some students have no money or in the family have no money. They might earn money from working after finish the class or when they are free. The college students can have some work in any place(the restaurants, the library, minimart and super market, department store)All of this can help the poor students to have some more money and It would help them family too. But some work it's not to good to work, in some places it's very dangerous too such as at night club, bars. So, they should select the safe place to work. I think the part-time job can help the student learn to work for themselves, Can try to take care about themselves, And about the money! It's the most important to learn to take care a money. Can make them think a lot of things in them life. All about the parents, family and yourself. I am sure that they will have experience too. The last, I think it should be can help learn about the life. Of cause everything it's not easy to learn. But if you can pass this problem, it's might be easy to stayed in this world.
