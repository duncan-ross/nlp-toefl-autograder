I think the part-time job is not important for the college student because they parent sent the student to study in the university for learn everything that should to use in the future job to have a good job include with a good income that the college student should be concentrate with study in the university. A Part-time job is a job that does in the free period to earned extra income. I think when the college student earned extra income they will use for himself/herself and when they do the part-time job and they cannot manage the time they will have a problem with their grade, just a little of the college student that give the extra income to their parent to help the expense of their family and do not have problem with the study in the university, that make me disagree about the part-time job is important for the college student. If the college student do the part-time job for find an experience or help the family about the expense or do the pat-time job in the end of semester I will change my opinion about a part-time job with the college student. For my opinion I think a part-time job is not important for the college student when they thinking only the extra income from a part-time job.
