I agree with the following statement. First, the college students will have to work to live and be independent on their parents after the graduation ( though some of them won't do so ), so it is good that they prepare for working and independence. One of the means of it is a part-time job. In short, they should have experiences of working. Second, there are those who start to work after they graduate the high school, but on the other hand, the college student don't work. That isn't plain. You say that, however, the college students study hard, so they don't have to work. I think so. In these days, what they do are the club activity, shopping, playing karaoke, talking in the cafeteria, and playing other activities that don't bear fruit for society. I think most of them go to college because they don't want to work. Those who have profits are only themselves. They should work for society. Third, in Japan, oho don't a child must work, but the college student don't work. Though they don't have to work, they should protect their principle.
