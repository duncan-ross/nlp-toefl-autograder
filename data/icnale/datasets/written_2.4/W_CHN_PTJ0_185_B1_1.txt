People always have different ideas even on a easy thing. On this point, some people have the idea that college students have to join a part-time job while other people disagree. Form my perspective, I agree with the former. The reasons are simple. First of all, the course of finding a part-time job is a challenge for these students. They will never imagine how difficult finding a job is before you really find one. You will feel tremendous pressure in the job market at the same time. It can give you some help about how to persevere your determination of finding a job. Secondly, we can acquire some knowledge that will not exist in our classes. Some theories your teachers' deliver to you which you can put into practice are the knowledge you really obtain. Besides, on the one hand, a part-time job is not a heavy work and it will not take you a lot of time. On the other hand, you can earn extra pocket money. Well, in that case, why not?However, there are not always just some benefits. College students sometimes engage themselves into deceits because they are inexperienced in finding a job. But that's not all, some college students even take a part-time job as a reason for not concentrate on learning knowledge. In a word, we should have a proper attitude toward a part-time job.
