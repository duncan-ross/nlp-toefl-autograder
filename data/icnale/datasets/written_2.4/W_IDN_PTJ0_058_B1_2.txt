In this era, there are many college students that they have much free time to spend but they waste it. But, few of them did not waste their leisure time and earn some money. One of its ways is doing part time job. Many people said that it is important for college students to have a part time job. If we have a part time job, we will get good things. Good things can be direct or indirect impacts. The direct impacts, such as get some money. We can use that money to go shopping by ourselves (if our college's payment already paid), to pay our college's payment (it is the way to help our parents), or just for increase our saving. In the other way, there are indirect impacts, such as get good experiences. When we have a part time job, we will learn how to manage our time specially a student who has a tight schedule. Beside that, we also can learn how difficult to earn few money by ourselves. So, we will not spend it for nothing again and treat it as precious thing. In my opinion, I agree that to gain some experiences, college students can do a part time job. But, I disagree that a part time job is important for us. Because, there are many students that have few time to do other things beside their fixed schedule in campus. So, if we do a part time job, it will ruin our concentration and make everything getting worse.
