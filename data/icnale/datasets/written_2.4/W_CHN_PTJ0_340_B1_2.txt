 In my opinion, whether college students have a part-time job is not important. Furthermore, I persist that college students should not find a part-time job. The reasons are listed as follow. Firstly, what we college students need to care is not about money but study. I recognize the famous saying from Hu Shi, the ex-headmaster of Pecking University, 'what our students in college should do is just to study'. That means college students' only mission is studying, so taking a part-time job will by no means affect the study. If college students have part-time jobs, they will have to reduce their time for study. Working several hours a day costs a lot of time and energy. As a result, the students will find it hard to adjust to the studying agenda, and finally, they will fall behind or fail in their studies. Secondly, many students hold the view that part-time job will enlarge their social experience and that will help them in future. But what would they really get from the part-time job? Things are not that easy for students, the effects of part-time job are usually beyond their expectation. Because part-time jobs are mostly made up of small employments like waiters in restaurants or tutors teaching English to younger students. These jobs may be suitable for a under graduate. But once the students graduate, they won't take these occupations. Therefore, students shouldn't waste their time on part-time jobs. At last, I again stress that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
