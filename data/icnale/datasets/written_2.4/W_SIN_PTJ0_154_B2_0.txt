I do not feel that college students should have a part time job. Firstly, studies should be the main focus in a college education. Students who are too preoccupied with their jobs will find it difficult to concentrate on doing well in school as working is bound to take up much of their energy and time. This is especially true for those working in food and neverage industry as well as sales. These jobs are both time consuming as well as physically and mentally tiring. Although it is useful to supplement their allowance, I feel that it is not worth it to sacrifice time to earning money. This is because as the old saying goes, "time is money". Of course, there are exceptions when students are in need of cash to pay back student loans and pay for school fees. In such cases, it is understandable that students will want to have a part time job to clear their debt. However, this is not the majority of students. Also, parents should bear some of the responsibility for their children's education. It is difficult to concentrate on both studies as well as financial responsibilities and hence I feel that the students should not bear the full brunt. Overall, students should be focussing on doing well and completing their degrees. Then, when they start working in future, they can pay back their loans and be filial to their parents.
