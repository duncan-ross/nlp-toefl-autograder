I have ever had part time job. One year ago, I did that at convenience store In Daemon. When I worked in the store, I did my best. I cleaned the floor of The store, I washed the shells, and said Hallo to the customers kindly. First, I enjoyed the part time job, but later I didn't want to work anymore because I can't study for my university studding. So, I said the owner that I want to finish my part time job but he asked me to work more because he couldn't get new person promptly. I had to reject to work more but I couldn't. I worked continue and I couldn't study continue so my school point was been bad. After that, I realized that even thought important someone ask me really, if I have to reject, I must do that. Because, I will regret about that if I don't reject and I have to deal every results. After the part time job, I can do well other works more. I think it is important that someone get first part time job because the person will get a similar part time job before. I don't want to happen the thing to me so I do endeavor to get new part time job in the vacation. In this summer vacation, I will do help some teacher teaching young students. As my future job is teacher, I want to lean teaching skill.
