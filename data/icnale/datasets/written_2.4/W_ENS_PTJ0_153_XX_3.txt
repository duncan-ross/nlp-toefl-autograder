I don't think that it was important but I do think that it is important and necessary for all students to do so now, considering the financial mess that we are in. Thanks to the global recession, are lot of people around the world are in serious financial difficulty. In light of this fact, I think that it is necessary for students to get a part-time job so that they may contribute to the economy in some small way. Many students have to work anyway, because their financial situation dictates that they do so. For others, they may not need to work but by doing so, they can also assist with the global economic recovery in a meaningful way and that is of course, by earning and spending cash. We can all play our part in the financial recovery process and the students can also play their roles in the process too. It is necessary and I believe that it will help all of us and not just the college students in that we won't feel like there is nothing that we can do except sit around in some kind of helpless mode waiting for things to get better. The situation won't improve unless we, all of us do something to improve it without just relying on governments to get us out the mess we find ourselves in.
