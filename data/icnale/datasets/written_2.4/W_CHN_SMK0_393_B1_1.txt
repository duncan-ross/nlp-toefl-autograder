 I firmly believe that smoking in public should be forbidden by law. As we all know, smoking does harm to the smokers. But in fact, it also does harm to the people around the smoker, which has been manifested by the WHO. You can throw all cautions to the wind to be a chain smoker, and that's your right. But you can't be ignorant of the people around you in public. They have the right to do their things healthily in public, and they do not have the duty to be exposed in the environment which is full of those nasty smelling. No one will think you are cool when you are smoking in public. Instead, they may look down on you. Besides what I have mentioned above, smoking may ruin those students who are not well educated. They are immature and curious about everything and they may imitate what an adult do. So chances are that they also become smokers, which doesn't seem to be a good thing anyway. In a word, smoking in public is so harmful that we must put a ban on it. Only through the joint effort from the citizens and the government can we live a better city life.
