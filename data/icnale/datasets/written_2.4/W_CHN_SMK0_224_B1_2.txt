 In my opinion, smoking in public is harmful not only to the smokers' health but also to the near people. If someone smokes several times he or she will be addicted to the cigarette, and in the future, the person will fill upset, tired if he or she don't smokes in a period of time, and in the end become a slave to the cigarette. So the smokers have to spend a lot of money to buy cigarettes which adds the economic burden, what's worse, smoking can destroy the smoker's health. The cigarette contains more than one hundred poisons than can cause cancers especially lung cancer. The nicotine can destroy the blood vessel. The carbon monoxide can decrease the ability of erythrocyte that conveys the oxygen. There is a study that every time the smoker smokes one cigarette his or her life will decrease 5 minutes which is the time it takes to smoke one cigarette. Smoking is harmful to the people near the smokers too. The smoke contains many tiny solids which can enter the blood directly by our lung. Staying in a room which contains much smoke one hour is equal to smoking a cigarette. So, forbidding smoking in public is necessary and is a great act to ours.
