Smoking has become a habit that is very common and widespread in the society. Dangers of smoking on the health of the body have been studied and proved by many people. Adverse effects of smoking was already known for certain. Many studies have shown that cigarettes contain many toxic stuff and therefore smoking increases the risk of various diseases, such as heart disease, lung cancer and impotency for men. In fact, this smoking habit is hard to break and people are rarely recognized as a bad habit. Moreover, people who smoke to distract themselves from stress and emotional pressure, more difficult to break away from this habit than smokers who do not have a background of depression. Therefore, I think government should ban smoking in restaurant and other public places because it will help to stop smoking and it doesn't disturb people and harm other peoples' health. I have read just now that Spain bans smoking in café and restaurant. Effective as of January 2, 2011, the Spanish people are not allowed to smoke in cafes, restaurants, and bars. In addition, there is also a ban on smoking advertisement commercials and on television. It is a good example and I think we can imitate it.
