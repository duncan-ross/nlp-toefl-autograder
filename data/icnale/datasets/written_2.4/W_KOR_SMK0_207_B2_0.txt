Today, more and more people come to think of their health seriously, so many smokers decide to stop smoking or non-smokers concern about the effect of second-hand smoking in the public place. As part of the health trend, some people insist that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. However, I don't agree with this opinion for the following reasons. Firstly, we already have a solution about this problem. Many restaurants have separated the seats for smokers and non-smokers. We just sit separated seats with our preference. Secondly, it can limit the freedom of smokers. Smoking habit is not crime but a bad habit for one's health, so we can't limit smoker's freewill although they don't us any harm. Lastly, it is very rigid opinion. We can do a heath campaign or any public advertisement for helping smokers to stop smoking. For these reasons, I totally disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. We have to find a better way that smokers and non-smokers live together harmoniously.
