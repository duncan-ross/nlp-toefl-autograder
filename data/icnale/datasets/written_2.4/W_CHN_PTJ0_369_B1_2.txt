Finding a part-time job during college As a college student, we may face many challenges and new responsibilities. Especially I choose to live in the university rather than at home. We have much more time and freedom, and also we have to learn to how to budge our time accordingly and meaningful. Doing a part-time job can be a perfect way to achieve these goals and develop our skills. First, working part-time can be easily done, if we really want to do it. A university can provide so many chances that most of us can find a part-time job, we can be a tutor, a shop assistant, a librarian, or a bicycle-keeper. And a part time job can help getting the necessary funds that we need. Without help from parents, we cannot even afford tuition, room and board, or living expenses. Another benefit of part- time work is the opportunity to gain some working experience and to develop our people skills. If we work at the school cafeteria, you know that this had nothing to do with our major, but to give it more on our resume, We all have to enter the society sooner or later, doing a part-time job now can help in future. Many students do not want to give up their free time, for both studying and social activities, so they view a job as a last resort. However, a job is not an option. We have to work, and if we doing a part-time job we can be better prepared for the future.
