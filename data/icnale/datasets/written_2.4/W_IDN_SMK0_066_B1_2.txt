I agree with this statement. Because not every people smoke. I know that for smokers this statement is so difficult to accept, but we have to see the bright side for this statement. People who smoke are not going to smoke at the restaurant again, and that will make the restaurant atmosphere healthy. The smokers should be understand about that statement, because that statement are made because some reasons. People which are not smoke shall prevent the smokers to stop smoking, because it will make them unhealthy. Many people will have bad illness because of smoking. For some reasons the government prevent their citizen to smoking at the public places, that is because the government want to keep their country clean and smoke free. Smoking can make our world suffering, because of the smoke that cigarette had are contains so many toxin that could be dangerous for human, plants, or animals that lives on the Earth. Why restaurant. I think smoking inside a restaurants is dangerous, if at the kitchen have a gas malfunction, smoking will make it worse and smoking can trigger an explosion. As we can see all bad effects of smoking at the restaurants, we must forbid smoking at the restaurants.
