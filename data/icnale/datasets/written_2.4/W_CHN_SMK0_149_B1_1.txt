Recently, some people appeal the government to make a new law to ban people smoking in restaurants. More and more people started paying attention to this thing. It is related to the idea that building a healthy and clearly environment in public places in our country. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. On one hand, as we all known, smoking is bad for our health, no matter we are smoker or people who don't smoke but breathe the smoke in the air. The harmful things in cigarette are not only do harm to our lungs but also our brains. To keep our body more health, we should not smoke. On the other hand, restaurants are public places, a large number of people eat meat in there every day. For us who extremely don't like smell the flavor of smoking, it is a loathed thing that smells the smoke. And it is harmful to our health, especially to the children. What's more, a survey shows that if people smoke when they are eating the bad effect will enormously than other times. So we should forbid smoking at all the restaurants. Since that case, I believe that it is a good thing to ban smoking at the restaurants in the country. Because not only us dislike smoking but also the smokers will benefit a lot from it. And it can also help those people who want to give up smoking to keep away from the cigarette.
