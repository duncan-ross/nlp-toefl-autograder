I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons for this opinion. First, college students are around 20 years old. It means that they are grown-up. Sooner or later, they must get their money by themselves. Having a part-time job is a way to earn money. I think having a part-time job is like a practice of real work. Second, we must be independent from our parents. As a proverb says, Money and parents are mortal, so someday parents die. If parents die early and we don't have a part-time job, maybe we can't live any longer. To prepare for this situation, we should have a part-time job. Lastly, we can construct strong human relations with our colleagues. It is very important, because we can't live without human relations. Actually, I have few colleagues to work with right now. Now I'm working at a cram school as a teacher. My whole colleagues are older than me, so it's a bit difficult to be friends with them. But I'm doing great efforts to be a good colleague of them. From these opinions, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But overworking is not good not only for our health but also for our schoolwork. So we must be careful with this, I think.
