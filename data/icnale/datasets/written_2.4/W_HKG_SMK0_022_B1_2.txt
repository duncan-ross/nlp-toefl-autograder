In Hong Kong, smoking is prohibited in many places such as parks, bus terminus, indoor stadiums, and so on. There are many smokers disagree for the smoking ban in such areas and want to fight for their right to smoke. Should we impose smoking ban in all restaurants? I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. First, non-smokers have the right to free from smoking. It is important that the smoking ban policy should care the needs of this group of people. For example, there is smoking ban in all bus terminus, even though people normally stay for less than 20 minutes in such area. By considering the effect of smoking on non-smokers, it makes sense that smoking should be banned at restaurants as most of the people, especially smokers, spend at least 30 minutes having meals in restaurants. It will be harmful to people if they have to smoke in second-hand for such a long time. Second, most of the restaurants are indoor restaurants, even though the ventilation of the restaurant is good enough for clearing the exhausts in the kitchen, it is rarely able to clear the smoke from the cigarettes as the smoke concentration is very high. Therefore, air inside the restaurant is of poor quality. This will affect the health of the customers. The effect is even more prominent to the people working In the restaurant as they have to stay in such area for a long time. In short, it will be good if smoking can be banned at all restaurants and promote non-smoking habit at the same time.
