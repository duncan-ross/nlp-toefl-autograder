I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers should not smoke in the restaurant because restaurants are public places, and at the same time to show respect to people who do not smoke. The smoke produced from cigarettes not only smells bad but also hurts other people's health. What's worse, it is difficult for non-smokers to not inhale the smoke produced from smoking since the smoke is all in the air as soon as it is produced. Even if there are smoking areas or rooms in the restaurants, the smoke may still come outside the areas or rooms and be inhaled by other people. Moreover, since there are more non-smokers than smokers, I think it is not reasonable to ask non-smokers to wear masks. So the smokers should take the responsibility to protect non-smokers from inhaling the smoke and stop smoking in public. Besides, banning smoking at all restaurants may help smokers quit smoking, which can help reducing smoking population and somehow prevent diseases related to smoking. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country to protect non-smokers from possible health damages caused by smoke.
