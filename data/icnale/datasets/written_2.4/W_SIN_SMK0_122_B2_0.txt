Smoking is discouraged in many countries. Singapore is one such country. In Singapore, smokers are often discriminated. In many public places, smoking is simply banned or small areas are drawn up in the periphery for the smokers to congregate at. The price of cigarette is artificially increased by heavy government taxes on cigarettes. Socially, advertisements and education often paint smoking in a bad light and smokers are generally viewed unfavorably in the Singaporean society as a result. So why do people still smoke? I believe that apart from the conventional reason of addiction, there is another more important factor. After all, to put it crudely, if addiction is the one and only reason, after the current batch of smokers die, there should be no more smokers. I think that the other important factor is that smoking is generally viewed as a "cool" deviant act. The more the society and government persecutes smokers (short of totally banning smoking), the more smokers will be seen as deviants. People marginalized by society might therefore turn to smoking simply to find an identity. Otherwise, it could simply be because smoking is "cool". After all, everyone loves an underdog, and in this case, smokers form the class suppressed by the society and government. Think of original hippie fashion in this sense, it was a counter-culture developed by the marginalised portion of society that eventually developed into something mainstream. Since we must have some form of discrimination to discourage smoking, I feel that ironically, this is exactly why it is inevitable that we will always have smokers. People should therefore not place too much emphasis in eliminating the smoking problem and focus more on managing it.
