In my opinion, I consider that it is necessarily for college students to have a part-time job. The following are the reasons why I think so. First, being a college student means that you are an adult, not a child anymore. You should learn to make money with yourself and keep economy independence gradually. I didn't mean that if you are a college student, you can't take any money in your family. I just mean that an adult should share responsibility for family livelihood, shouldn't ask your family for money only. Second, the period of university is the stage before entering society. Having a part-time job will learn some skills which you do not learn from class and which are useful at the work in the future. If you have experiences of part-time job, you have more advantageous positions than someone who doesn't have any experiences of part-time job. Finally, having experiences of working makes you become more maturated. At work, you will face many other kinds of people, and go through some frustrations or get some achievements. All of these make you grow to maturity. Because these reasons above, I think that it is good for college students to have a part-time job. And should every college students have a part-time job during the period of university.
