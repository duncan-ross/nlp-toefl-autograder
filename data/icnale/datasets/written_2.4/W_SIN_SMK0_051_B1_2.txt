Currently most public places had banned smoking by law. The only areas for smokers to smoke are in the "yellow box" or the "smoking cubicle". This is a good decision make by the government as it shows that the government are aware of the health implications on the general public and are taking action to protect them. It will be good to have a complete ban of smoking in restaurants as it will allow the customers to have clean air. Even with the smoking cubicle that is isolated from the main area, the smoke can still travel to the main area since air cannot be controlled. The residue left by the cigarette is dirty and make the place looks unsightly. Smoking will affect the hygiene of the restaurants too. As explained earlier, the residue is very dirty. If customers see the residue on many parts of the floors in the restaurants, it will give n impression that the owners did not clean the place and will defiantly affect the experience felt by the customers. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It will cause inconvenient to the smokers; i believe they will understand when they understand the reasons behind it. The public will benefit the most from such as ban.
