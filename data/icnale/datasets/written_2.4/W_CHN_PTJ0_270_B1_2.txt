Nowadays, many college students take part time jobs during their leisure time. While the others prefer enjoy their time by entertaining or learning something new. Up to me, it doesn't matter whether one takes a part time job or not as long as he enjoys his life. He who takes part time jobs can gain working experience and earn some money. And maybe the working experience will help him find a better job in the future. But I think whether he likes the job is the most important thing. If he enjoys doing the job, it will be worthwhile. And if he doesn't, he will keep complaining and gain nothing for the job. However, if someone is really poor and short of money, it will be necessary for him to take a part time job to live on. And to those who don't take part time jobs, they can do whatever they like during their leisure time. Unless they lose their way, they can also learn a lot and enjoy their lives. I think enjoying life is most important to almost everyone, more time for one's own hobbies may be enjoyable. In conclusion, what counts isn't whether taking a part time job but whether you enjoy it. A part time job can make one's life colorful, but it can also make it boring.
