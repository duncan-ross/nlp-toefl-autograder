 Smoking is a common problem which we have taken so much action. Some one said the situation would be batter if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with it and at the same time, I think a kind of restaurant should be set for some people smoking. On the one hand, smoking should be banned. There are so many people who are affected by cigarette. Many illnesses such as pneumonia are results from smoking, and many people died from those or being afflicted. A lot of families are facing hardness or break. What's more, many teenagers learn to smoking which will take them to being unhealthy and treasonous. Parents are anxious and worrying about their children. Considering those disadvantages, smoking should be banned. However, although we have taken many measures, the behavior still exists. Smoking being completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is a kind of forcible step. Through legal system forcing people away from cigarette is a kind of measure we take when it's necessary. On the other hand, some people smoking like a chimney may be hard to giving up smoking right away. So in my opinion, it's needed to create a sort of restaurant that people smoking can get together to smoke a little and exchange experience about lay aside the habit of smoking. In the meanwhile, let those smokers be limited for the time they can smoked in those restaurant. All in all, smoking being completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is needed, but what's more, we should consummate relevant laws and regulations.
