It has become a common phenomenon that doing part-time jobs nowadays has become one of the major parts of our college life. College students some do part-time jobs to make extra pennies and others only fulfill their life. As far as I am concerned, doing part-time jobs plays an important role in our college life. Firstly, part-time jobs greatly teach us to be thankful owing to the fact that it is the first time in our life to earn on our own even though it is usually poorly-paid. We can never know how hard our parents have been going through to raise us up unless we come to earn our life on our own. It all bothers us whether the child we teach follows our instructions or whether the customers in the restaurants we serve are really satisfied with us. We learn to force ourselves to meet social demands, which is what our parents have been doing during the last twenty years. Therefore, after we finish our part-time jobs, it is definitely necessary to ring our parents to express our gratitude. In the second place, due to the high tuition in colleges today, doing part-time jobs really helps the students' family to relieve this heavy burden. And to those who do not have much allowance in colleges, many hardly make ends meet almost every month. Thus, an extra pay will be quite helpful. Last but not the least, students can get connected to the outside world by doing part-time jobs. Problems like the discussion on the salary, the tough employer, all provide us with a rare opportunity to handle everything by ourselves. We were all well taken care of before going to the college and by doing part-time jobs we learn to get a solution independently and face the society on our own. In a nutshell, doing part-time jobs is absolutely vital in our college life and it is beneficial that every student tries to obtain this experience.
