In recent years, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in college. Some students say that university students should not take part-time jobs because the part-time jobs will reduce the time students spend on study. Others argue that part-time jobs help college students to learn more that cannot be taught in the textbooks. Both sides have their own reason. Then, is it a good thing for college students to work part time? In my opinion, college students should take part-time job on the condition that they can handle their study. First, part-time job is a good way for college students to have a better understanding of our societies. There are so many things that students cannot learn in classroom but jobs in societies can. Like the abilities to find a job or to get along well with your boss. These things can only be learn in the work places but no classroom. So college students can benefit a lot of social skill from part-time jobs. Second, it can promote students' study through part-time job. They learn more things about their major from part-time job. What's more, students who are poor and suffer financial burden can make money through part-time job. There are many students cannot afford college tuition. So, part-time job is an important way for poor students to relieve their family burden. In conclusion, if students can do well on their study, it is good for them to take a part-time job.
