I do agree that it is important for a university student to do part-time job based a good time management. When we talk about part-time jobs, it is obvious something that is time-consuming. But the reality is that doing a part- time job can earn a handsome of money that can certainly reduce the heavy burdens from the university fee and daily expense. At the same time, your university life will be affected even through university students have a more feasible time schedule. For example, you need to skip lectures or you are required to work night and you will be easily frustrated due to busy workload. So, time management is far more important in university study. On the other hand, part-time jobs can provide actual working experience that can enhance your competitive in the future. It is obvious that an employer is willing to employ a mature employee with working experience that can tackle problems. Those working experience can at least improve your interpersonal skill, like communication skills, be patient. Sometimes it is hard to improve your personal quality only by the books. For example, we have language courses but it does not mean that you can communicate well with foreigners. Only through actual practice can improve own personal quality. Having real working situation, other than money earned, is one of the major benefits that we can gain from the part-time job. It may be a matter of money to do a part-time job. But it is the proper attitude to be developed during your work. Part-time job sounds time-consuming. You may give up your extra-curricular activities and at the same times you are taught be tough to deal with different problems. That is why is worth to do a part-time job.
