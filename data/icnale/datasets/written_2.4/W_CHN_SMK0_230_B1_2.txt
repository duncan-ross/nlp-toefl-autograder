 Regardless of the warnings on the cigarette boxes, thousands of smokers buy cigarettes all over the world, which is quite a familiar picture to us. Though most of the smokers know that tobacco is usually connected with lung cancers and other diseases, they still can not get rid of it. This strange phenomenon can owe to the following two reasons. First, people are not fully aware of the harmfulness of smoking. Although we know that smoking can lead to lung diseases, few of us can exactly tell the percentage of lung patient or how many people are killed by cigarette smoking every year. So most smokers would rather to risk their lives than give up smoking. But actually the number of people killed by smokingis about 25 million per year, which I think can frightened many people. The anti-tobacco propaganda is still far from enough. Second, the government depends too much on the taxes of the cigarette companies. It is under the acquiescence of the government that the business of the cigarette companies runs smoothly. And this also explained why no law can be carried out to force people get rid of smoking. The solution to this problem is very hard to be found, because it involves economy, the balance of the society and many other parts. But there still is hope. I hope sincerely that one day in the future that smoking has already become a history and no family suffers from it any more!
