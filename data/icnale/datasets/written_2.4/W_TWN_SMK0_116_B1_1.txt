I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to many medical researches, they show that cigarettes are harm for human. It may cause the disease of lung, moreover, may lead the cancer. That is why I think that cigarettes may even not be produced. Most worst of all, the container of cigarettes will make people addict to so it is hard for those who likes smoking to quit it. Nevertheless, more and more reports show that smoking is only harm for smoker but anyone who breathe smoke in. I think it is unfair for people, who don't smoke, be compelled to smoke. There is the only method to protect no-smokers, forbidding smoking in public. So the government tried to carry out a policy that all indoor space, including restaurant, should ban for smoking. We all know restaurant is a good place for all children, adults and older to relax and eat delicious dishes. If someone smokes beside you and you are a nonsmoker, can you still eat as nothing happen? Or you may shout with angry at the unpleasant man? I trust most will act like latter. Although the policy may cause unhappiness from smoker, I think it should not be given up. After all, it is about whole human's heath. Now that, we all know smoking will harm for us, why don't we agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants?
