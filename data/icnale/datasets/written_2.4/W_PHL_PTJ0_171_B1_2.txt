The cost of living for people nowadays continues to grow every day. As a result the cost of everything from food to housing to education is really high. But what intrigues me most is that college students now go for jobs just to pay for the schooling. Some students or as they call them working students work while they are studying just to earn money for their schooling. Because their parents don't have money to send them to the school they want to. It is really hard to talk about college students getting part time jobs, because personally I have not met any college students who have part time jobs. But I think having a part time job in college can be seen in two ways. It can be good and bad at the same time. Its good because it motivates you to study and to succeed in school because you know the value of money that you spend in you schooling. It can be other hand because it might take up all your time for studying, friends and even your family. So I think in general there are really two sides of the coin with college students having part time jobs.
