Every time when people are having their meals in the restaurants, it is not tough to find that some people are smoking in the nearby. People who are near to them are forced to have their meals together with the second hand smoke. This really makes the non-smoker customers get mad. In my point of view, I also support that we should ban smoking in all restaurants. First of all, smoking is a harmful behaviour which affect the smoker and others who smoke the second hand smoke healths adversely. Of course, those smokers may think that they do have their freedom to smoke in any place they want, including the restaurants. Neverthless, should we scrafice both smoker and non smoker healths just because of satisfying those smoker desires? Why do we need to intake second hand smoke, which is the things we hate of, together with our meals in the restaurants? Moreover, there are many place for the smokers to smoke instead of the restaurants. They can go to the smoking area if they wa nt to smoke, so that they can satisfy their needs while on the other hand, without troubling to other non smoker people. Wouldn't this be better than smoking in the restaurants, which make many people get mad? Actually, smoking isn't a good habit at all. There is no doubt that we should ban such kind of behaviour in all public area, not only in the restaurants.
