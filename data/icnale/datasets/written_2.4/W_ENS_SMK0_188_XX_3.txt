Yes it should be. We have banned a lot in Britain and most countries are all doing the same thing now and Japan should too I reckon. At first I used to think that it should be left up to the business owners and the public to sort out. I changed my mind though when I saw that, people just got used to the idea anyway and although they moan about the weather if it's freezing outside, they just toddle off out the door for their fag. There were a few questions about rights as well, but when I thought it over I realized that it is a non-smoker's right not to get poisoned by smokers and since fags contain poison, then they shouldn't be near foodstuffs anyway. At least that was my simple logic and still is because we wouldn't normally pour petrol over our steaks or vegetables so why would we want other peoples' smoke, which is poisonous, on our steaks either. That would mean we were a bit daft if we did and yet we have put up with that for years so who knows what is already going on inside our bodies or what damage we may have caused ourselves.
