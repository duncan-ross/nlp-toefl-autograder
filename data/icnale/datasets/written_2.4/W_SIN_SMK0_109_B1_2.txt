 I agree to that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country to a small extent. I believe that by completely banning smoking at all restaurants, it is a too overbearing rule. Although I am a non-smoker, I feel that smokers should still be given a certain level of autonomy of places where they can smoke in. Smoking is indeed a bad habit that the government should discourage, however, it is not feasible if they were to ban smoking at all restaurants. I believe that the current rule that smoking is only permitted at blocked out areas in food centers is an effective measure. This will restrict the space where smokers can smoke in and will provide a healthier environment for other patrons to dine in. Furthermore, many restaurants already provide outdoor spaces where smokers can go to have a smoke break. By taking away such outdoor spaces will be unfair and unreasonable. I feel that if the government were to completely ban at all restaurants, this will bring about much unhappiness among smokers. If the government plans to discourage smoking, it should adopt the informational approach instead. In my opinion, by informing smokers on the dangers and risks of smoking then will it be effective in deterring the bad habit.
