I agree this statement. I have five reasons. First, I am not smoker. I don't like smell of smoking and attaching cloths and my body the smell. So I want you to stop smoking above all restaurant. Second, when I have meal, I don't like passive smoking because I'm uncomfortable and I don't taste good the meal. Third, others may worry in the restaurant. For example, if pregnant woman is in the restaurant, she will be passive smoker. It is not good for her baby to be passive smoking. Fourth, Children mind passive smoking. If someone goes to the restaurant with his family, his son may cry by passive smoking. So he and his family will be not happy. When I was a child with my family in a restaurant, I don't cry but I was not happy. Fifth, the restaurant employment need not divide smoker seat and non smoker seat. And customer need not alternative the select. Of course, I chose non smoker seat. I hope to reduce smoker population. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I think smoker is decrease in Japan. Because smoking areas is decrease, I think that smoker is also decrease. So I agree this statement.
