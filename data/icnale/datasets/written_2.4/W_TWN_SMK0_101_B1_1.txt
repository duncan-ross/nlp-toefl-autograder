I don't approve to the idea that the smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country now. The reason is that though the percentage of the people who smoke is becoming low. Most of the people also start understand that smoking is bad to their health and the smoke they breathe out is bad to other people who don't smoke but breathe in that air. As the result, I think it is proper to have some law that limit the right of the smokers is okay, but we can't ban the smoking right totally in the beginning. We should make the goal come true step by step, for the reason that some people is really addict to smoking, it is almost impossible for them to quit smoking. Therefore, some restaurants still have some area for the smokes to smoke. The locations of that smoking area should be settled far from the main area of the restaurants, and the smoking place have to be air floating. Banning the smoking by the law is one way to make people don't smoke, however people don't smoke is because the fear of the government, I don't think let the people be afraid of the government is a good thing. Another way is we can start from the children. By educating the children not to smoke when they become elder. When the future smokers becomes less, the need of the law that banning smoking will no longer exist.
