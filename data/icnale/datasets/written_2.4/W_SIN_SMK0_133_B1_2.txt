Smoking is a silent killer. Indeed, it not only harms the smoker, but also everyone around him. What is most worrisome about this vice is that it contains narcotine, not only carcinogenic, but also causes addiction. As the Pringles slogan aptly puts it "Once you pop, you can't stop. " Indeed, that is the case of many smokers. They are unable to kick the addiction, even increasing the number of packs they smoke a day. This not only numbs their pleasure from smoking, causing them to smoke more and more, but also causes ultimate harm to their bodies, such as lung cancer amongst many other ailments. The people most at risk, however, are not these smokers, but the people around him --- the second-hand smokers. Not only do they not have the filter of the cigarette, inhaling more of the carcinogenic substances in the smoke, they are the innocent beings, who had to deal with the effects that they cannot control. On the other hand, cigarette companies are reaping in gargantuan profits, at the expense of the lives of others, not just the smokers and the second-hand smokers, but also exploiting cheap child labour from countries such as Cambodia etc. Such a vice should be stopped at all costs. Smoking should be banned, for the benefit of everyone.
