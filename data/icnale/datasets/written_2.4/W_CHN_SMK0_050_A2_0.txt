I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. It is generally accepted that smoking can destroy health. Not only are more people join the smoking family, but the number of people, who are smoked, is rising rapidly. We need to do something to stop it. In my opinion, banning smoking in the restaurant is exciting. There are several reasons to it. To begin with, how terrible the smelling is when a person is smoking beside you. The disgustful feeling will last for a long time in our mind. In addition, restaurants are the place where people eat food. You can imagine when the cigarette dust fall down to the food, we may be sick later. According to the science book, we know that there are lots of bad things in the cigarette. They are really harmful. Many people get diseases because of smoking. Last but not least, establishing a friendly-environment society becomes a developing trend, and banning smoking can be the first step. So we can see that the reasons above can all show that banning smoking in the restaurant is a wise choice. May be the government can do something now.
