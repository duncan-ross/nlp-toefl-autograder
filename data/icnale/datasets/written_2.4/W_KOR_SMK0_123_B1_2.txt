I know, you know, and everyone knows that smoking is terrible. Human being has been smoking long time ago. Why do they smoke? I have never been smoked so I don't know about that. I think that the person who made smoking didn't know that smoking is harmful to the human's body and the people who lived at that time didn't know that smoking is harmful to the human's body. If they realized the true, they didn't smoking. But eventhoug now, we must not smoke. How can we stop smoking? The government helps that. If the government makes the signore's price badly high, People who smoke will reduce because they can buy the signore. Then, the government must not earn money from sailing signore's. If they couldn't earn money from that, they can stop nourishing the signore's plants. And then, the government must make the large region where people can't smoke. As they don't like look at the area, the smoking people will reduce smoking. Finally, the government must made law that the people who smoke in public area Is guilty because the smoke gives other people who don't smoke harmful. So I think that is guilty what can't see. Also we have to teach the children harmful about smoking before they start to smoke. I think if everybody on the earth stop smoking, the human being will be healthy more than now.
