Merely, as other people think that smoking is not a good thing, I have the same mind. Smoking brings many bad effects to the person who does smoke or the people around as the passive smokers even for the environment. The main reason why it is should be banned, absolutely dealing with the health of the smoker itself. Cigarettes or tobacco that used contain lots of chemical approximately fifty items are known and a hundred are not, which are absolutely not good for heart and lung. Those chemical such as nicotine, tin, carcinogens etc can make those vital organ have to work harder than normal even damage the system of the organ. Especially, the chemical named carcinogens which may cause cancer. Second, the previous bad effect also can be happened to the person around the smokers. Since they do smoking indirectly, they breathe the smoke and the bad chemical go through out nose, throat to lung. They do not do smoking, but they have to pay for the bad effect of smoking. The last thing is it is not good for environment also, those chemical may cause the air pollution and make the ozone which is sort of tissues, a hole or tear the tissue. Then, it may result in global warming. Therefore, smoking should be banned, especially in nowadays where earth is damaged than ten years ago which is proved by global warming, the big universally enviromental matter that every humankind face as the people of the earth. I do agree with the government programme to forbid smoking in public places such as mall, university etc. and provide a certain room for smoking. Indeed, we cannot erase smoking instantly, yet, we can omit it little by little that may lead in a big change.
