Some students in collage not only in collage but also in senior high school usually join to part time job because they thought they can got more experiences and got more money and also made they be autonomous for their life. But for me part time job is not efficient for student although some people thought that with join part time job can made student be autonomous but for me it is not impossible they just said that but the fact is not like that although some student did it very well but not all of student did the same things. Second reason is one of some student cannot manage his time for his job and his collage I sure he can fool his activity. Part time job usually made students forgot any things for example their home work or their important things. Part time job usually made student just focus in work and only work because work in part time is very enjoying better than we did a home work. And finally part time job is very wasting time because student must study not work but after you finish the study in senior high school or in collage I thought is more efficient.
