I'm not agree with this prohibition because I think we are cannot enforce the mind of other, observe that the past unit now nobody can enforce the other refrain from smoking but there is the one thing that the government and the social can do is legislation smoke cigarettes in place keeps. cigarette is the narcotic but be the narcotic that is lawful. It there is the narcotic but be the narcotic that is lawful. If there is the law about the suppression smokes cigarettes, certainly that to be the conflict in the government and producer, person smoke cigarettes. I think not good if have the law prohibits to smoke cigarettes but the thing that us can do is the legislation gives can smoke cigarettes in place keeps only, prohibit smoke at the public, if who disobey a role as punish according to law that public, if who disobey a role as punish according to law that the thing that the law can do and the one thing that adult will do be formed as good to the youth, fight about the bad result from smoking cigarettes and encourage give the youth not get involved with narcotic these thing might make the youth has seen the bad result from smoking cigarettes. The last thing if make a cigarette has disappeared from this world that be the best but it very difficult thing.
