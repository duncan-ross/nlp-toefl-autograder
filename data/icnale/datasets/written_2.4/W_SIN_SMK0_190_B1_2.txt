I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, I do think that smoking should be completely banned at indoor areas of all restaurants in the country. It can be allowed at alfresco dining areas. In a closed-door environment, there is no ventilation and thus smoking in a restaurant severely impacts the health of second-hand smokers. Many people dine in a restaurant to enjoy the service and comfort it provides, but the presence of smoke in the same room would mitigate the value proposition of a restaurant. Not only will people be bothered by the fact that they are now involuntary second-hand smokers, inhaling the smoke smell while eating would disrupt one's supposed gastronomical delight. From the non-smoker's point of view, it is thus very disruptive if smoking is allowed at all restaurants in Singapore. Smoking is still accepted as a vice in society today and thus it should be banned in closed-door, communal environments. While the smoker may argue that it is one's right to smoke anywhere anyhow, he forgets that the act of smoking is done in a community and thus one has to give up one's private rights for the benefit of the collective community. This is how it is done in a rather collectivistic society like Singapore. Unless society is slowly moving towards the concept of smoking as a normalized activity without harming the collective, it should be banned at all air-conditioned restaurants in Singapore.
