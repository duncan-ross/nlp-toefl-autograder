I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job, but I think it is important for some college students whose bursary is not enough. For someone who want to have a lot of experience of doing jobs I think it is good idea to have a part-time job because it get both experience and money, but it is not good idea to so serious with part-time that it effects studying. If whatever reason make you have part-time jobs, the important thing that you should remind yourself is My present main job is studying and you should divide your time properly. You should select the part-time jobs that don't make you more tire. The part-time jobs that you select should be in your free time and your time must transcend for studying outside class. Moreover, it is good if you get a part-time job that is compatible with your major. For me it is not important to have a part-time job. Because I think that the most important thing that I must pay most of my attention now is studying and I should my best with my studying to get a great job in the future. In term of experience, college let students have a period to practice the job when the students are in year 4 of studying. I will get the experience when I reach that time.
