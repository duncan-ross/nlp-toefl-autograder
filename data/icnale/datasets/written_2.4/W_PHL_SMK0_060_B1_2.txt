Smoking inside restaurants is a big no according to dining etiquette because you are polluting the air that other diners breathe most especially when you are in an air-conditioned area. There may be portions of restaurants that allow its diners to smoke but still the smoke the cigarette emits still travels through the air thus still affecting the other diners. From my own experience, when me and my family were eating at a smoker-friendly restaurant I noticed that one-fourth of the place was designated to be a smoking area, the area was not sparated from the non-smoking area and that the place was air-conditioned so instead of having the aroma of the delicious food that everybody was eating, the restaurant was coated with the odor of scent of cigarette smoke. With the entire restaurant smelling very rancid, we weren't able to enjoy our food and after eating we told ourselves that we would not eat at a smoker-friendly place again. I think that smoking in restaurants should be banned because it is a sign of disrespect toward other diners. Restaurant managers should be aware of this and they should prevent people from smoking inside their establishments to be able to take care of the well-being of their other diners.
