Is it important for college students to have a part time job for Japanese college students? I agree with to have a part-time job. Firstly because, to experience job is also learning. Job is hard and different from school life. But you may be fun as you improve your skill. I think you can grow your mind this time. Part time job is very important. Secondly, today's economy has been worse. This influence our family's money. If you have considerate mind, you should think you earn money to lessen parents' worry about tuition fee. Almost all of my friends have part-time job in same reason. Thirdly, we are in university, so we need a lot of money to enjoy something; drink party, trip, hobby etc. One of my friends often tell me to lend him money. He has a part-time job, but as he spends all of his earning soon, he is always worried at the last of month. No one doesn't need money, so I think that to earn money is good.
