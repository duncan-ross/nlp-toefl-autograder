They come to face the problems of their lives and start part time jobs to fulfill their needs. And on this way many students continue their studies and they afford their needs itself. Many people who do job in offices their salaries are too short and could not fulfill their needs they want more part time jobs. The students who do part time job and also study when they come back they face many problems they don't care their health because they busy all the day, they also don't have a bit time to concentrate on their studies fully. Because their time is always disturb due to worked. If they have money to face their needs they will fully concentrate on their studies and succeed in the field of education but they did not do because they also worked and face tension. The students and who do part time job and they solved their problem and the problems of their parents. They are brave and also have sprit to solve and face the problems of their life.
