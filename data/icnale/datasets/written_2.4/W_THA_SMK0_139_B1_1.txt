Agree with that should not be smoking in restaurants around the country because the restaurant is a restaurant for dining. A public restaurant to anyone who does not supposed to smoke inside the restaurant. The bad will happen, it does not happen, but with male smoking only But it will affect the people around inside the cylinder with the people. The opinion that smoking in restaurants. But the disadvantages that both the internal and external The image of social outsiders look. The impact that followed. The owner should be made no-smoking signs in restaurants or public places. Smoking is not allowed to see the sign prominently or a restaurant owner should be prepared places for smokers to sit it. It would be better for him be smoke in restaurant. A good government should be a law banning smoking in restaurants or public places that should be advertising to the negative effects of smoking and the distribution more pronounced. And there should be more stringent penalties than ever. To the environment in general society and individuals will be happier to see people smoking, quit smoking. All people who don't smoke will be happy too that they don't smell tobacco and don't get hurt from smoking.
