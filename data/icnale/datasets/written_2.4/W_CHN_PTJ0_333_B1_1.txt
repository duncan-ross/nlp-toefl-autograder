I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, we are adults now. Most of us will take a job after graduating. If we have some working experience before we take a formal job, we will do the job better and live a better life. Secondly, the average age of college students' parents is more than forty-five. If we have a part-time job, we can lighten the pressure on our parents. Last but not least, going to college is to let us get more skills and experience and form good characteristics. Having a part-time job can also help us in these. When you are criticized by your boss, you must be patient and take responsibilities for your fault. When your colleague say bad words behind you, you must keep calm and find where you are wrong. Some people will argue: What if college students who take a part-time job failed in exam? Don't be frightened. The courses in college are not very heavy. We have lots of free time after school. We can also meet different kinds of people and make friends with them when we take a part-time job. By the way, I feel really happy when I get the money for my first job. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
