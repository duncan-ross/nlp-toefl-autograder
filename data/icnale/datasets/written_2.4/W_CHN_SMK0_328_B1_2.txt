In my view, smoking should be forbidden anywhere not only in public. Of course I don't smoke and also I don't like anyone around me to smoke. I can't figure out any positive effect it has on people. Many big restaurants now decide to forbid smoking or have a simple place for people who smoke. These kinds of decisions solve the health problem and the safety problem in the same time. No more second-hand smoke and less danger of fire, I can't agree more. But in some small restaurants, there are still many people smoking freely, making the room full of smoke. For me, I will never ever go to eat in a restaurant like that, no matter how delicious the dishes are. I prefer a better place to eat. The worst habit in the world is taking drugs, I think. And the one next to it must be smoking. So, why so many people still smokes? The answer is that they are addicted to it. Yes, it's addictive. It does great harm to the smoker and the people around. Les's get rid of it. Public places, like restaurants, are made for people to relax, not suffer. So please give us a space of fresh air.
