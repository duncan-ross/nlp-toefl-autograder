The prohibition of smoking is expanding from day to day, and it is bringing an uproar among smokers. While many people choose to ignore these protests, I believe it is unnecessary to ban smoking in all restaurants, for smokers deserve the right to smoke and it is better to lead them to stop smoking on their own will rather than forcefully banning them. First, smokers deserve the right to smoke as much as non-smokers have the right not to inhale smoke. As citizens of democratic countries, smokers as well as non-smokers should equally be granted to act as they please, as long as their conduct does not invade the interests of another individual. Then, one may argue that smoking is harmful to the health of second-hand smokers. True as it seems, this argument is insufficient to support the complete banning of smoking in restaurants. Alternatively, we can always separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers. When there is a way to guarantee the rights of both sides, it would be unfair to pass an act only in favor of non-smokers. Second, when we want people to behave in a certain way, it is much more mature to lead them to do so voluntarily rather than compel them. A strong support for the ban would be that it also works to the benefits of smokers. However, the way they come to a stop should be that they choose to do so because free will has a significant meaning. Specifically, they should be educated to perceive the possible consequences to their health and realize the financial burden of smoking, but never forced. In short, helping smokers truly realize the advantages of quitting would naturally promote healthier views and lead to fewer smokers in public places more efficiently than simple bans. In summary, for the sake of equal rights for smokers and a mature method of helping them, the idea of banning smoking in all restaurants should be rejected.
