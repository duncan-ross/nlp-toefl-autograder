Do restaurants that you go have people smoking? Do you like it ? For people who don't smoke, Smell from smoking make someone crazy because smell make they feel dizzy and don't want to eat food. In some restaurant have a zone for smoking but some restaurant don't have. When people eat food, they catch a smell smoking. It make someone feel dizzy and vomit. Someone is allergic smoke because it make they feel ill. Not funny for them. If you go to restaurant for have a good time to eat a good food but you meet bad smell and smoke. But for smoker, they want to smoke anywhere that they want. Smoking is easy to taste but hard to stop. In my opinion, all the restaurants in the country don't have to ban smoking but should provide zone for smokers because smoking is right for everyone. We can't stop them. If all the restaurants in the country have zone for smoker, they will have more customer. Because this idea is good for everyone. People who not smoke get a good air and good meal and smoker can smoke. Everyone will happy and enjoy in food and will not have bad mood.
