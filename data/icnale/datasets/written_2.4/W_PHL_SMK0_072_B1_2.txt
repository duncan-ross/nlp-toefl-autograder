We all know that there are different harmful effects that we can get if we are smoking but I believe that smoking is a choice and I also believe that smoking in restaurants or in public places does not harm anyone. If we are going to ban smoking in restaurant/different places it will be unfair for the smokers because what I've said is that smoking is a choice. If smoke is our problem what about the smoke that came from cars and factories? Should we ban it too? If we are talking about banning smoking in restaurants it is not our choice, it's the owner of the restaurants choice or decision if he will be in favor of banning smoking In his/her restaurant because some of the restaurant that are selling cigarettes is part of their business to earn profit. If you don't want being near/around to those who smoke or you don't want the smell of it then you are free to leave the area. I am not against anybody or from the smokers and non-smokers because everyone of us has a right in this world. I think in the side of non-smokers, they want to ban smoking because even they are not smoking they still can get harmful effects from it by experiencing secondhand smoking. But smokers also have their own complain or reason why they don't want smoking to be banned. I believe that smoking is not bad because if we are smoking it is our choice and we need to accept if we will have harmful effects from it. It is not bad if they know how to use it properly/moderately. Smoking is a choice and no one is forcing anyone to smoke or not to smoke that's why it is not bad.
