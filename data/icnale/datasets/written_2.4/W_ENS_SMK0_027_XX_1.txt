I have been in favor of banning smoking in public restaurants since I was a teenager. At that age, I had very sensitive skin and eyes, and I found that the cigarette smoke which accumulated indoors would aggravate my condition. This made me very hateful of smoking and smokers in general, but the more I think about it the more I realize that we just need to provide a place for them where they can smoke without worrying about hurting many other people or being rude. I also know that smoking is very bad for your lungs and causes your blood to have less oxygen than the blood of a non-smoker, which is very unhealthy for your entire body. In some ways, it does not seem fair to limit the rights of people by banning smoking, but I think that the government should do more to regulate this area because it is so important to maintain good health of the citizens. All of these ideas are equally valid in any country, so I think that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan. If this cannot be accomplished, I hope at least that they have very well maintained smoking and nonsmoking areas in all of the restaurants.
