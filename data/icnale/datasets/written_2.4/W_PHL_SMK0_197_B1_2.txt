Why should people smoke in restaurants considering these places are not private? Can't people control too much temptation and act on this with decency? Smoking in restaurants must be banned completely, because it is not practical to have a restaurant with an unhealthy atmosphere. If this keeps continuing on a daily basis, people who do not smoke can breathe in second hand smoke that circulates other room. In other cases, it can prevent air ventilation from flowing in, and room temperature increases, especially in a full house occupation. It can also spread nicotine residue along the floor and table tops, which other people can easily touch, and is also an unpleasant sight around the surface. In addition, the use of smoking areas inside restaurants is still not safe, why? Besides the wall barrier that surrounds, the door opening isn't entirely close of secure. So even if people in the area think its secure for smoking, small gaps from the door openings could still let smoke out, and can be unpredictable to detect. To top it all up, smoking in restaurants can produce a fire and can spread throughout the room. This can put people in danger and establishments at risk.
