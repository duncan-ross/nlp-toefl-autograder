I agree because the chemicals in cigarettes are deadly and not only do I not appreciate having to inhale secondary smoke from time to time, I don't want chemicals from cigarette smoking any where near my food thank you very much. Either ban smoking in restaurants completely or have smoking and non-smoking restaurants. Some smokers may feel that they are being pushed around if a ban is imposed but that as they say is tough luck and they will just have to get used to it. Other smokers in different parts of the world seemed to have managed OK with their bans and I think that Japan is capable of managing it as well. I am not trying to push smokers are target them just for the hell of it. It is simply that they may like sucking smoke but I don't and I don't have to. Let's have equality for all in the smoking saga so that they can smoke in their appointed spaces and we can enjoy no smoke in ours. Now that is what I call equality and a win-win for all. It is fair for all concerns, nobody is being picked on or need feel resentful in any way.
