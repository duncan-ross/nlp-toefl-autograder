 Nowadays, as we all see, there are always some people like to smoke in public places. They enjoy smoking one after another without caring about the people around. In my opinion, smoking in public should be forbidden. I remember that when I was in high school, I had to go to school before 7 o'clock. However, the school was far away from my home. So my timetable was tight and stable. Then almost everyday I had to take the lift full of smoke, that means there was a guy enjoying smoking in a public place without any guilty before I took the lift everyday. So I had no choice but to breathe in the second-hand smoke. It made me sick. The smell was so strong that I would feel like vomiting. That was a terrible experience. As we all know, smoking is very bad for people's health, and the second-hand smoke is even more poisonous. A smoker not only destroys his own health, but also others close to him, especially his friends, his family and his lovers. Smoking is just like a monster which kills one little by little. Even if one doesn't care about himself, he should also give up smoking for the sake of the people around him. It is reported that a cigarette can even kill a little baby. How terrible it is! So I think even if forbidding smoking can't be accepted by everyone, the government should forbid smoking in public.
