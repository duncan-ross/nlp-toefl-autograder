Smoking is toxic. It's not pressure for anyone who has to breathe smoke of cigarettes that they don't do. People have rights for protect their health. So the government should make the law for this. I agree with Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I think smoking should be completely banned at all not only the restaurants but also others public places such as hospital, school, university, office, park, mall, hotel, streets, sport club, etc. Smoking indoor is very terrible for non-smoking persons. They want to be healthy and they also disgust with anything that can be unhealthy. In some countries, Banning smoking is work. It may be base on the law. If the government has absolutely penalty provisions of law, the population will afraid and do the right ways. No one would want to get the cancer risks for their life and it's a good manners for smoking in your places. I really know that stopping smoking is very hard. Smoking can also calls the addict who smoke only one always smoke increasingly. Another way to reduce smoking is fight for campaign, give information about smoking and teach student to know the bad result you getting when you smoke.
