Usually I just stay away from smoking in general and so I don't have any very strong opinions on the subject, but it is pretty easy to say that from a logical perspective it would be a good idea to ban smoking at restaurants in Japan. This is because of the well-known and wide ranging diseases from smoking such as cancer. I feel like it is even almost so bad that you can pretty much guarantee yourself to get cancer if you smoke. I'm sure there are some people that smoke for a long time and have no cancer, but either they will develop cancer in the future or they're very lucky to have extremely strong bodies. Most humans to not have bodies that are that strong, and so smoking can cause serious health problems throughout their life. More than that, however, I think that smoking is a waste of money and time. Not only will smoking shorten your life, but you have to spend valuable minutes each day going outside to smoke. Japanese business people are very busy as I hear it, so, perhaps they can use some of their time more wisely if they quit smoking, and banning smoking at restaurants will also fit right in with this idea.
