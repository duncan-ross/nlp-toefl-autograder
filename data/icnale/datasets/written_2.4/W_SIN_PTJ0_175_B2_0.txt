I feel that it may be important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because it can provide them with a source of income. Many students are actually taking pocket money from their parents. Our parents have actually worked very hard to support us from young. I feel that it would be better if we could be more independent. Having a part-time job would therefore be a legal and good method to solve this problem. Also, a part-time job can allow you to learn skills which you cannot learn from your books. For example, a waiter would be able to pick up service skills which are essential skills in the working environment. This is one of the reasons why some schools make it compulsory for students to go for internships. However, different jobs would allow you to learn different skills hence I feel that part-time jobs are important. However, college education is very stressful. There are huge amounts of projects, assignments and reports to be done, on top of the countless hours spent in lectures and tutorial. This is especially the case in Singapore, where the assessment component for colleges includes term papers, assignments, projects as well as the final examination. Admittedly, the stress and time factor makes it difficult for students to sieve out time to work. In conclusion, it is important for students to balance their school work well, such as completing their assignments well ahead of time. This might allow them to have sufficient time to take up a part-time job to take care of their daily expenses while equipping them with skills
