For me. I think who students have a part-time job are good and diligent. They can help their parents about money or use their earnings for buy something which they want. Moreover they receive important experience about life in real world and they can learn something about solving the problem. Student can do work whatever they want to do. Such as work in library, restaurant and work with computer. Working of college students is good but if they can't divide time well. IT is going to they can't succeed in learning and everything. Working should have rules such as working on Saturday and Sunday. In day must to learn should more intend. Some people can success from working with learning but some people can't do it so that students should look their self that they can do a part-time job but it isn't effect to learning is terrible. It is very good for people who haven't money or want to help people in family but they must adjust time well. However if they think they want to help parents that they are very glad and students don't work only. They can do housework, intend learning. Finally every student has to good people of social.
