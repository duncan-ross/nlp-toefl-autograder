All students have a time when they feel stressed at school because of the workload or because of relationship problems. These students will try and find ways to release the stress, for instance, some will play computer games, some will sleep and some will smoke. The students who choose to smoke will face health problems as well as social problems in the future. Cigarettes are psychologically addictive so students who smoke now will smoke when they're adults as well. Cigarettes contain substances that will give you a moment of relaxation; however it also contains other toxic substances that can cause lung cancer. More women seem to smoke in Hong Kong nowadays, and this causes problems for them because when they get pregnant, they will still smoke because of their addictive qualities. This will cause birth defects in their children. It can be extremely uncomfortable to sit next to a classmate who just came back from smoking because his clothes will smell of cigarettes. Also, if they have been smoking for a long time already, their teeth will have probably started becoming yellow. Looking at a smile with yellowing teeth is unpleasant. As a non-smoker, it can be difficult to spend time with peers who smoke because they will be smoking and I would be experiencing secondhand smoke. Students should not smoke because not only do they affect themselves, but they affect other people in only negative ways. There is no positive aspect of smoking; it will only create an instant moment of pleasure. There are so many better ways to release stress for example playing competitive sports or spending time with friends in a café.
