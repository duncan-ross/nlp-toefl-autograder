Nowadays, so many university students get a part time job. Some people say university student should concentrate on their studying rather than try to get some job experience. What I think is university student should get part time job. The following reasons support my point of view. University life is stress, they have not time to do anything outside studying. That is one of my uncle said. However, I think it is not completely ture. People who can go to university should have ability to mange their work. Although they are very busy, they still have time to do something good for them. Doing part time job, they can solve the financial problem. They should have a chance to solve it by themself, before they go in to the society. There is a research said that the number of students rent money from bank during their 3 years studying. Therefore, they had better experience how difficult to lean money. What is more? Student have a result in studying is not good enough for them to donate the society because experience is the most important thing for their future. Doing Part time job can donate such a experience for them to get a better job. Part time can not only help their financial problem but also donate a good personal draw for them. It is a good chance to abroad their horizon and get well-prepare for their future. Sum of all, I really think that doing part time job is for good them.
