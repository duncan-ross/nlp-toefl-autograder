A part time job is a job in which an employee does not work full hours. A part time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full time job. Employment in a part-time job has advantages and disadvantages which need to be carefully weighed when one is considering employment options. Part time job can also be used in reference to a student, usually in higher education who takes only a few courses, rather than a full load of coursework each semester. On the other hand, part time employees will be limited to basic positions, since the company many not want to invest in extensive training. In other cases, employers offer more options and flexibility, sometimes in the hopes of attracting long-term full time employees. As is the case with a full time job, when another position opens up in a company, current employees may be encouraged to apply, thus moving up through the ranks. On part time job, there are some good effects if teenagers work. The biggest effect is that they can have some experience that they cannot have in the school.
