To some extent we can say that part time job is necessary for college students and to some extent it is not right. Sometimes part time job is necessary. Firstly the children in developing countries from poor families cannot study. Their parents cannot afford their study and college expenditures. Secondly, the poor families are normally very large and the bread earner is the male head who single-handedly cannot meet the needs of each member. Thirdly, our government has failed to utilize state funds and resources for the uplift, education and training of the masses. Because of their disappointing inefficiency and failure to organize mass education programmes most of the people are poor and they cannot provide sufficient resources of study to their children. Therefore it is better for their children to do some job instead of leaving the study. To some extent their part time jobs are not good for them. Firstly, they find very less time for study and as a result their college results are often very poor and their purpose of study dies. Secondly, part time job often indulge them in wrong doings and they become criminals. Therefore we can say that part time jobs create many worries for students and they should be strictly restricted.
