I think should not allow smoking in any restaurant that is good and correct, that should to happen as soon as possible. Because of information that I knew that sentencing of cigarette smoke is bad for others affect more people smoking. Even if the people who are pregnant have to inhale cigarette smoke and the result will be against the child in the stomach. That was that people who are smoking can harm the health of the people around you. Therefore, legislation is not allowed to smoke in restaurants all around the world. That is the best way to pressure in those who smoker is not the place for smoking. When smoking place less, that is an indirect force them to smoke the need to finally quit smoking. And the last, I think everyone can quit smoke for yourself and people around you. If anyone can quit smoking and will help themselves reduce the risk of lung cancer and heart disease. The heart disease, this disease is ready to kill all of you where you unaware. I hope that in the near future this law will come out to use real. Then it will have a positive impact on many people.
