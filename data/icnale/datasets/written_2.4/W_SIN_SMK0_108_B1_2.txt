I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Right now, what is being done at some restaurants is having a non-smoking zone and a smoking zone at separate parts of the restaurant. However, smoke travels, which defeats the purpose of having the separation in the first place. Eventually, smoke would still be smelt at the non-smoking zone. It can be argued that the smoke would still be much less than what it would be if there was no separation between the two zones. Nonetheless, being someone who really dislikes cigarette smoke, smelling it in the air when I clearly am sitting in the non-smoking area actually greatly affects my mood. Therefore, I think that restaurants should either completely ban smoking or if it doesn't have a way to ensure that the separation between the two zones is effective, allow it altogether. That being said, it might not be economically feasible to have restaurants that allow smoking without having the two zones, because it would totally be a turn off to non-smokers. These restaurants' customer base would be greatly limited to smokers and non-smokers who do not mind the smell of cigarette smoke and the adverse effects it has on one's health. Hence, I think that all restaurants should just ban smoking. One might say that this complete ban would bring inconvenience to smokers and this can be seen as a form of discrimination. I beg to differ, though. Smokers can always go outside of the restaurants for a smoke before or after meals. In addition, smoking brings with it a negative externality; it brings harm to third-parties who breathe in the second-hand smoke. It is an act that should not be encouraged; in fact, it should be discouraged. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
