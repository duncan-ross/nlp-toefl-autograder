Recently, the problem that whether smoking should be banned at restaurant is hotly discussed. I think the view point that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country has it reasons. On the one hand, smoking is a conventional manner on occasions like a meeting between friends. What's more, offering a smoke to a person is a generally accepted way of making acquaintance of him or her. In a word, it is smoking that often creates a relaxing atmosphere. On the other hand, it is also smoking that keeps many people and people who live with them from living a happy life. Many people have terrible diseases because of smoking for a long time. Also, the restaurant is a public place; these who smoke are to blame for spoiling others' health because second-hand smoke can be very harmful. People who are non-smokers will not have mood to eat when they sit close to smokers in the restaurants. On conclusion, I think smoking as a manner of long history, is impossible to be banned by law. The government and the press are supposed to try their best to spread knowledge about the harms of smoking. Thus, I agree with the banning of smoking at restaurants in the country. But not only by regulation, must we try to arouse people's awareness of the harms of smoking.
