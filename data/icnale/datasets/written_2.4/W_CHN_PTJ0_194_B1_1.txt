With the development of the society, so many college student choose to take a part time job. From my point of view, I think it is very important. There are too many advantages of it. First, a part-time job can help you pay for normal living expenses, including some food, books, and clothes. Then, we shouldn't ask the money from our parents, because our parents are very painstaking. What's more, your parents will not be around you forever, and so you have to become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner you begin this process, the faster you will become independent finally. That's the point I think. Second, a part-time job during college can build your character I think. Most of the jobs to college students are very humbling. Maybe I think they hold the view that we are just college students, we still don't know much about the salary. But I think after you experience life as a waitress,, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities. Because it is priceless for your later work in the future. And you will realize that the world does not give you something free, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. In conclusion, a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will learn some personal responsibility and experience that you can't learn from the book. If you find a part-time job that is tolerable, you can do it well and it is important to you!
