Smoking is a bad behavior that shouldn't do. Smoking have many disadvantages not only can affect a person who smoking only but it can affect people around you also. It can make annoying to people around you. I think we should be completely banned at all especially in public place. Many smokers don't interested in what place they should smoke or not. Their always smoke wherever they want to smoke although that place is a public place such as restaurant park or office. If smoking be completely banned at all not only the restaurant but all public place it so good for anyone who don't smoke because in cigarette smoke have many toxin can affect to respiratory system especially lung and cigarette smoke is a cause of cancer also. Finally it good for everyone if smoking be completely banned at all and it will be better if we can banned cigarette too. The government may release some policy too stop these people who want to smoke in restaurant and public area. It may help the country to be better. Who doesn't smoke will be safe from a danger of smoke such as kids, ladies, old people or anyone who doesn't support to have smoking. Not only the areas will be clean from cigarettes, the air is still fresh and good for living.
