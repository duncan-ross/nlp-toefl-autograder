I don't agree because while there has been much evidence put forward by both sides regarding the dangers of passive smoking (inhaling secondary smoke from a smoker), it has been suggested by several medical studies that the evidence is inconclusive in relation to the potential harm caused by passive smoking. I am a non-smoker and I do prefer to enjoy smoke free dinners when I eat out myself. The question here is, whether any democratic government can just ban anything on a whim or based on questionable evidence. Admittedly, it may eventually be proved conclusively that passive smoking kills. If that is eventually the case, then I would support a ban wholeheartedly. For now, I still keep coming back to my reference to democracy and imposing on citizen's civil liberties. In some countries, especially in the USA, many bans are already in effect in some cities and it only takes a short drive downtown through any popular nightspot where there are restaurants, bars and clubs, to see hordes of people outside braving inclement weather to puff away even in the early hours of the morning. So, while I understand that governments can make and change laws all the time, would this be democratic and legal in Japan?
