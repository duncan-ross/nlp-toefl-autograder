I strongly agree with this statement as there are lots of benefits behind this measure and two aspects will be stated. In view of the public hygiene, the measure could relief the indoor air quality. Smoke is one of the major and harmful pollutants in indoor air when smoking is not banned. Smoke contains lots of detrimental substances especially nicotine and tar that make people become addicted to smoking and causing cancer respectively. By banning smoking at all restaurants, all the customers would not be forced to inhale the second hand smoke that is a hazard to health. Another advantage will be discussed in terms of business. A healthy image could be built for the restaurants if they show their fully support in this measure and hence, a growing business would be resulted. The customers could enjoy their meal in a comfortable environment and they would be willing to come again. Also, the measure could reduce the inconvenience in dividing the restaurant into smoking and non-smoking areas. When deciding what is the proportions of the smoking and non-smoking area, the restaurant keepers have to minimize the influence of the two types of customer to each another by increase the distance between them. Actually, this is a difficult task for most of the restaurants which are usually small in size in Hong Kong. The action would undoubtedly reduce the number of customer that is available in the restaurants and hence affecting the revenue. Therefore, smoking completely banned at all restaurants could achieve a win-win situation.
