I do not think negatively about smoking. Modern people are getting a lot of stress lately. Prohibited from smoking tons of people are allowed to reduce stress. However, in public places where children such as restaurants and hope not to smoke. Cigarette smoking alone is fine, but other people adversely affected by unwanted tobacco smoke should not think. I'm human and do not smoke cigarettes do not think I was wrong. But these days the trend is increasing, many women are smokers. These days, when you get down the street smoking a lot of women can be seen. Just like old times to smoke in secret, but nowadays women are not ashamed. Such features may even surprise you sometimes. I see a woman smoking is still an unfamiliar sight. Smoking is bad for women are affecting the baby. Most of the problems caused by this smoking are health. Many people would have some health problems for staying long in the public areas. Many people would fee unpleasant and don't want to come back to public areas. The public areas are for all people, not only for smokers. By prohibiting smoking in public areas, we can have lots of bents. Therefore, it is likely to create the correct smoking culture.
