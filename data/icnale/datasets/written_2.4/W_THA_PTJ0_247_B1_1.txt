I agree with this idea, because some colleges students might have more free time when they have finish their classes. They should have more chance to work at any work places as a part-time job. After they finish their classes, they should do other things to get money and experience about working at the real place. They will get a chance to work at those places where they have worked. It might be a way to reduce too much people who have not get works. There are lots of free times in the college that the students should do something instead of sleeping at the dormitory. The part-time job is a way to improve the students working skill, because working in the part-time is a little thing but has more advantage to the students. If the college students go to have a part-time job, it might help their family's budgets which they have to pay for the students at the college. The students will get more experience, friends, working skill, and money when their have the part-time job. Although, the part-time job does not have only the advantage, it will have the effect from working at the part-time job. Please have the part-time job.
