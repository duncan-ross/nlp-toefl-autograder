Smoking is a practice where a substance is burned and the smoke is inhaled. It is usually done by people who are stressed, tired and needing to relax. They also smoke for recreational purposes. Smoking is dangerous to one's health, as it leads to numerous diseases like lung cancer, heart attacks and other vascular problems. It not only endangers the health of the smoker, but also those who inhale the smoke. It is known as second-hand smoke. I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants across the country. Restaurants are usually closed spaces and therefore smoke from cigarettes may not be easily dispersed to the outside air. The smoke may stay inside the establishment and be inhaled by non-smokers. The smell of the smoke may deteriorate the mood of the restaurant's customers. It can destroy their appetites because of the foul smell it gives and it may even distract them from eating at all. Banning smoking at all restaurants in the country can make sure that it can provide the appetizing atmosphere that a restaurant should have. Eliminating smoke from these establishments can generate approval from non-smokers and may increase their revenue and customer base. Also, used cigarettes and its ashes scattered on the floor will no longer become a problem when cigarettes are banned. Along with the current ban of smoking in public places, banning smoking in restaurants will help reduce the places where people can smoke and might even reduce their overall consumption of cigarettes. Therefore, I strongly believe that implementing a complete ban of smoking in all restaurants in the country. It not only protects the restaurant's appetizing atmosphere but also take care of its customer's health and dining experience.
