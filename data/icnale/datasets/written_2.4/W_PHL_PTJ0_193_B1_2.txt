Having a part-time job as a college student is quite tough. Being a college student is already tough in the first place, having a part-time job means that the students would have less time in studying. I strongly disagree that the college student should have a part-time job. The role of a student is to study whether it is in any grade level. The college life is tough and needs a focus in order to pass the subjects. Some college students forced to have a part-time job due to financial problems. However, passing the subject is become their problem while having a part-time job. They tend to neglect their studies because they have no more energy left to do their homework. Second, having a part-time job makes the students feels they do not need to graduate from college. Since they already have an experience on having a job they think they do not need a degree to earn money. They tend to choose to work than to study because they enjoying the salary that they received. Lastly, it is not important to have a part-time job if the college students not able to finish their studies. The effort to earn money to sustain college studies became useless if a student cannot balance his studies and his job. Therefore a college student should only focus on his studies and not to have a part-time job. Part-time job is good but sometime it is not beneficial for a student. It may cause a student to delay in finishing his studies. I believe that a person should take one step at a time to succeed.
