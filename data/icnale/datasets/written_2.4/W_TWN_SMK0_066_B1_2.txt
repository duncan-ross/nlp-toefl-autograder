Smoking has been generally viewed as a serious bad effect to health, especially to lungs. Smoking can bring to lung cancer and make teeth weak and black. The compounds that cause cancer are released into air, not in smokers' bodies, when people are smoking. Hence, people near the smoker are usually hurt by these compounds more serious than smoker. In addition to health, some people hate or are allergic to the smelling of smoke. The smelling of smoke may also affect the taste of meal and the mood of meeting. Compare with outdoor, the effect may be double or even triple in indoor. To fight for our health and right not to smell the smoke we don't like, we should advocate the policy of banning smoking at all the restaurants whole-hearted. People who addict to smoking should face the big problem they bring to their family, friends and society. They should not just feed their own need without thinking of the effects to others and the health their own. Though smokers have rights to smoke at anywhere that we can't force and order them to change, they should think about others rights and choose the best place. At least, do not smoke when pregnant female or children around.
