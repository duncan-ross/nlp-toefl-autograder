For me, there are many aspects to college student part time jobs that one must understand when seeking employment and going to school at the same time. While the financial advantages of a job are beneficial, many times students simply cannot keep up with the demands of balancing school and work. Aside from making you more employable after college, having a part-time job will help you financially. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. Then if you are in the private school you should pay your tuition fee because have a part time job. However, if you don't need a job, is it worth the potential slip in your grades and school work by getting one? College student jobs definitely have their benefits and pitfalls. You just have to carefully examine your situation and determine for yourself. The students who work more than 15 to 20 hours per week often experience decreased school success, which can lead to dropping out entirely. Working long hours can also limit opportunities to build friendships and explore interests that enhance intellectual and emotional development. In the end, college student jobs should be something that will work for you as a student. Consider your personal needs carefully and determine if you should get a job as a college student.
