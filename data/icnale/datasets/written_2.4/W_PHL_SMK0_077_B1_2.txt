Smoking should be banned completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is dangerous to health. Smoking is the major cause of lung cancer. When one smokes, the person or people near him or her would be tremendously affected more than it does to the smoker. Even if there are smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants, what could it do when the smoke travels in the air and gets breathed by people passing by or inside the restaurant? I think it would be futile to think that having smoking and non-smoking area could prevent the people from inhaling the toxic chemical found in the cigarette. People of all ages are dining in restaurants and by inhaling the smoke from a cigarette could only add to the chances of acquiring respiratory ailments. Furthermore, second hand smoke is more dangerous than smoking itself. Another bad thing about smoking in restaurants is that not all restaurants have the smoking and non-smoking area. Usually, restaurants are air-conditioned. So when someone smokes inside, the stench of the smoke could be smelled all over the area. Thus, smoking also adds to the waste materials in a certain restaurant. A chain smoker could consume an entire pack of cigarette and just leave the cigarette butts behind after smoking. Even if there is an ashtray, it still could not help that the trash left by smokers are everywhere. It would be very annoying to the other patrons and customers. Thus, it destroys the ambiance of the restaurant. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the city for the benefit of the majority.
