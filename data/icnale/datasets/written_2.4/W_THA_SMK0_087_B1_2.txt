I agree that there should be measures to deal with smoking in restaurants whether big or small. Because of smoke in a restaurant disturb the person at the table and others to eat in a restaurant. It is bad manners, if we smoke while dining with others. Cigarette smokes interfere with other people. It also has a foul odor. It makes eating food are not happy. Most restaurants and the room are closed. And some of the open air, it will make spreading smoke across the room and can not drain out. It affects everyone eating in a restaurant. In which it has both children and the elderly, pregnant women may have. Cigarette smoke may result in a lot with these people. If you get it into the large volume may cause an effect on health. If the restaurant has a severe allergy is a serious danger. Therefore, measures should be apart of the smoking ban in restaurants and possibly to the public. We should create a society that should not smoke in public places. Everyone together on this campaign seriously, through cooperation from the private sector, including operators and the media. And more importantly who smoke should be aware of the consequences. If you are smoking, it should be in place where appropriate. Do not create trouble for others.
