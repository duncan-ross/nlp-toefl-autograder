I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Learning cannot be only at school, students nowadays need more experience in society. Part-time job is a good way for students to absorb the experience. It provides them the knowledge that cannot learn from textbook and some money that they can make their ends meet. Part-time provide a method that students can be productive and know how society works. And it is a way for students to use their free time, get away from the Internet, pub or doing nothing at home. But there is an important point to know: part-time job will never be more important than school. It is the only rule that I think every student who has part-time job should keep it in mind. The very work students should do is studying hard, absorb the knowledge from books and make it useful. College is the last level that you can learn things without pressure, you should cherish. If you think that working can learn more than school, why do you still at school? Why don't you leave school and get a normal job? Studying at school and learning from working are both important. Maybe school cannot teach you how to work better but it can teach you how to be a person. That is the main reason you stay at school.
