I strongly agree with the topic of smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons. First, smoking is an unhealthy habit that not only does harm to smokers but hurts others health. Study shows smokers are easy to get lung cancer and others are ten times more easily to get it. So smoking is obviously should be banned. Second, smoking can cause pollution. Our country has already have cars and scooters emits, we don't need another white smoke to hurt citizens' lungs. The white smoke can also cause plants' leaves getting yellow. And if it encounter to water, it cause acid water that is unhealthy to water creatures, land animals and also concrete building. Third, smoking can damage city's tourism industry. A city with a lot of smokers may bring bad impression to foreigners. It is also not comfortable to see somebody smoke during dinner time. So smoking should not be welcomed for the city. In a nut shell, I strongly agree government to ban smoke. I consider one day, not only restaurants but all country can ban smoking. That way, our citizens could become healthier and our city could be more beautiful.
