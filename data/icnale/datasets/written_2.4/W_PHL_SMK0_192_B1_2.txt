I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It should be banned in all restaurants in the country because the restaurant is a place where people eat. It is a place for eating not for smoking. It is improper to smoke in restaurants because other customers who are eating might be affected by the smoke produced by the smoker. Customers might not be able to eat properly because they are also inhaling the smoke. Smoking is also bad for the health of not only the smoker but also the other people in the restaurant who might inhale it. This means that the smoker is not only destroying his own health but also destroying other people's health like the customers and employees in the restaurant. Not smoking in restaurants shows respect to the other people. The smoker should be responsible for his actions and he should also think of the other people in the restaurants who will be harmed if he smokes in that place. If someone is going to smoke, he should not smoke in restaurants. He should find other places where smoking is not banned and where there are less people who will be affected by the smoke.
