Part-time jobs are work which has flexible hours with generally less commitment required as compared to full-time jobs. As such, they are enticing to people who can only afford at most a few hours a day for work including housewives and retirees. College students are no different. To students, taking up part-time jobs has many benefits. It enforces better time management skills and lessens the time available for students to idle, possibly lowering chances of delinquency. At the same time, earning extra money would aid in decreasing the financial burden on their families. Moreover, it imparts life experiences on the working life and also in handling various boss-subordinate and colleague relationships. These experiences are enticing to prospective employers, encouraging better job prospects in future. However, there is a caveat in that part-time jobs should not be taken up with the wrong intentions, for example, materialism. Also, if taking up part-time job affects student's studies negatively, then it would not be advisable for part-time jobs. Hence, it is no doubt important for college students to have part-time jobs with the potential benefits, but ultimately, whether students should take up the jobs hinges on their own maturity to handle the responsibility that comes along with the jobs.
