Many people do not know the danger of smoking, so many people who still smoke. And smoking can harm the heart, hypertension, and disturbances in people who give birth. Hazards are often told but not neglected so much that smoking or often referred to as ""active smokers. "" But the severe danger posed to people who inhale the cigarette smoke because cigarette smoke can interfere with breathing in humans. Although the rules about smoking, many people smoking every where. In Indonesia there is a lot of people smoking, and it is so disturbing other peoples who doesn't smoke, that's why I agree whit the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For example, if there is a pregnant woman, children, or old people eating in restaurants where there are some people smoke, that can make the peoples who doesn't smoke feel disturb. I think smoking is also useless, because we get nothing from smoking, they will only burning money by smoking. That is why I agree with banned all the smokers at all the restaurants. Because that give a lot of harms than good. It giving bad effects for other people who doesn't smoke.
