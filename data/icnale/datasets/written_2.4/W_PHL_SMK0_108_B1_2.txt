All of us experience stress, depression and pain. We get these from our studies, works, personal or family problems and of course financial crisis. we cannot escape from having these dilemmas since these are all part of our life. But definitely, we all want to forget these even just for a short period of time. we make our own way to escape from stressful world. and one of these ways is smoking. But the big question is –can we smoke in public places especially in restaurants? If this question will be asked to me, my answer would be a big no. I just can't believe that there are smokers who are very insensitive. They don't care if they disturb other people who are eating. They just continue smolking even if others are enjoying their food. They don't mind that these customers may lose their appetite because of the bad smoke they are inhaling. Public smokers should respect and consider people around them. I am against to public smoking whether it is in a closed restaurant or an open-air, the point is public smokers are polluting the ambiance that may affect every customer's appetite. On the other hand, I do respect people smoke because they want to release some bad vibes in their bodies or they just want it. But I believe that there is a proper place to smoke.
