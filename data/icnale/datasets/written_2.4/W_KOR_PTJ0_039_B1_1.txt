Part-time job for this opportunity to have a lot of thought. I should think positively. According to the news these days in the country said not to work. Is the subject of a newspaper can be seen well? That seems to be a lot of college students dropping out of school. I also did. One of the reasons is because the job well should not. It seems just a job after college is like picking stars in the sky. I also have become increasingly worried about day to day job goes. So what a lot of people these days seem to have a business. In addition, because of the nature of the English language and literature had better be dropping out of school. These days most people go to study in 1-2 years. After graduating at a later date, I also think you are going. Although there is much different. I think that should go to seek employment. These days, everyone is great specs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to work. Not a lot of jobs, because there are many good people skills. And I must think positively about part time job. Part-time job seems to be more efficient.
