I agree provided that they balance their time well. College is one of the most important times in many young people's lives. It is therefore important that they learn to balance their time in between work and study so that they do not succumb to the pressure of trying to cope with both. Having a job as early as possible is important because apart from making them more appealing to future companies, they will learn valuable skills that will assist them in transitioning from college to full-time employment. It is also important that they learn to start paying their own way as soon as possible and learn to take care of their own financial affairs without needing the assistance of anyone aside from a professional CPA. But I think that work and study balance is the most critical concern because if they can learn that, then this will carry over into work and life balance once they start full-time work. If they can't balance their work and study schedules in college then it is hard to see how they will manage their business schedules and still hang on to their jobs. This is absolutely essential in today's fast paced, information world. They have to learn to keep up or they will be left behind.
