In many country cigarettes are not sells for child under 21 aged upper, but, in some country the sellers are sells the cigarettes for everyone even child under the age, and that can be a criminals. Many people have a reasons for smoking, in Europe, people smoked for keeping their body heat warm, and some people smoked for enjoy the taste of the cigarettes, but in my country, smoking are used for bad reason, people smoked because they have stressed of their job, they smoked for losing their stressed, but the bad news is everyone being smoked because that reason even the woman and children, and there is one effect of smoking that can make something bad for women, that can make the baby of pregnant mom death, and the worse is people being addicted for smoke if they have any problems because the effect of smoking can make us addicted, because cigarettes have a nicotine inside it, and that can make some bad effect for us.
