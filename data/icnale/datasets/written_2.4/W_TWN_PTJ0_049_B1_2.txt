I agree that it is important for college students to take a part-time job. The reason is that the best preparation before taking a full-part time job is having the experience of taking a part-time job. Taking a part-time job can not only broaden your horizontal, but also enrich your vacation life between semesters. Moreover, it could make them explore their potential talents through doing part-time jobs. Take myself for example, because I enjoy getting along with children and have the talent in teaching, I chose to be a tutor as my part-time job. As far as I am concerned, although my students had difficulty studying hard and loved playing games so much that they always forgot doing their homework, I still needed to be patient to give them correct instruction and professional knowledge. Sometimes, when I was really tired and frustrated, they would smile embarrassed at me and began to try to perform well. Then, I would feel achieved and be courage to teach harder. Taking a part-time job as a tutor had me contact with different kinds of children. Besides, I could buy what I want by using the money that I eared by myself. Moreover, my life had been enriched as well as my spirit.
