As we are trying to make people aware of dangerous of smoking but it will take time. So, let them take. We can't stop the entire smoker from smoking but we can limit the harmful effects of smoking on secondary affects by allowing smokers a specific place where they can smoke. Mostly evenings are spent outdoor in big cities where people go to the restaurants enjoy having a coffee, taking treats from their friends, enjoying talk to their families. As the restaurants thrive with crowed so smoking should not be allowed there. If it is possible then a compartment for smoker should be made in those restaurants where people go off and on. Smokers should be responsible for caring others life. If they smoke they should show that only they smoke not others. People are likely to have adverse effect of eating in smoking group. Now smokers inhale the smoke and equally get disease or effect by sitting in Smokers Company. To sum up smoking should be not allowed in crowdedly areas especially restaurants, trains, busses. This would make a nation healthy and strong so firstly we have to uproot smoking and discourages its advertisements that smokers should be discouraged of smoking by them to a particular area in public places.
