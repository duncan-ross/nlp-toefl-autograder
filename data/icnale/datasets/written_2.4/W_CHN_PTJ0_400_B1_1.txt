When you come to your college, you are surrounded with much information, one of which is about varies kinds of part-time jobs. Do you get one and do you want to get one? Here we are going to talk about part-time jobs. I think it's important to take part-time jobs. There are three simple reasons. Firstly, we have enough time to do a part-time job. I think we have similar class schemes with each other as college students. According to my subject scheme, we have at least three hours' spare time after classes. Then look at how our classmates spend their spare time. Some of them play computer games when they are free. And some of them just surf the internet for nothing but getting over their boring time. And so on. Don't you think it's a waste of life. Second, from this we can gain many skills that will be used when we step into social life. For example, you can learn how to deal with your workmates and have a simple understanding of work. What's more you can earn some money, although the wage is very low. You can also know hard is it to earn money, and begin to understand your parents more. After that you may be more careful about your money. So it's really important to have a part-time job.
