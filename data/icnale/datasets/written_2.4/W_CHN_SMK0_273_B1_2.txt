I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because this decision is in favor of the health and well being of everyone, smokers included. As we all know, second hand smoke contains even more toxic elements than the smoker himself receives, which can cause lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. There is no point that those who don't smoke should have a dinner at the cost of their health because of smokers' fault. In fact, there are a large number of restaurants which have different sections for both guests. But it's common knowledge that air moves out of human control. People can still smell smoke even in their non-smoking section, which is unfair. Secondly, public places like restaurants hold many teenager guests. The behavior of adult may have bad impact on the young who haven't set up their health value. They may take smoking as a fashion way of self-expressing. In the recent years, more and more students have lit up their first cigarette out of curiosity and a superficial feeling of being fashion. Some even get addicted to it. Adult should be blamed for the phenomenon and take up the responsibility of building up a role model. Actions should be taken right away. As smoking is good to no one, banning it in restaurant is a perfect solution. Let's hand in hand, help those who smoke to quit and make those who don't smoke never even think of light up the first cigarette. Let's make our air clean and fresh!
