What is a part time job? It is considered as a part time job when a person only works for less than 8hours of work per day. Part time jobs are usually taken by people who still have to go to school, they are called working students. They can only work part time since they cannot accumulate 8hrs of working while attending 8hrs of school. During the summer, I have considered taking a part time job in Starbucks with my friend to have an income during summer. Unfortunately we weren't able to apply, but then I had a so called part time job in my village, I trained a kid how to play basketball but it didn't last long since he also had a busy schedule. I enjoyed my time while training the boy, and still I earned money. I have a friend who took a part time job in A-head learning center, he was chosen to be a teacher during the review classes of students who attended and were preparing for ACET, UPCAT, and DLSUCET. And she earned a pretty good sum of money and kept her surviving during the summer. When you choose a part time job, I believe it should be something you should enjoy; so that you will not be bored while doing your job and you will have a stable income even though you are still young.
