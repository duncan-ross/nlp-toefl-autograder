Opinions vary from person to person upon the question whether university students should have a part time job. As far as I am concerned, this problem should be analyzed in an objective manner, while considering different situations. For those who is shouldering a great pressure in their academic work, especially students majoring in science or engineering, it is not a wise choice for them to participate in social career too early. Because on one hand, this might disturb their own professional knowledge getting, and on the other hand, normal working experience might not be that badly needed for these students. However, students majoring in other fields, such like business and management, literature and art, their workload in academic is relatively small. So that they do have more spare time to participate in other activities, and I think a part time job a great choice under this situation. And advantages will be countless, like meeting a lot of new friends, accumulating working experience for future career, getting an extra income and so on. To sum up, I think it is reasonable for different people to have different choices, depending on their own perspectives. No rigid answer about this question is needed.
