In my opinion, it is very important to get a part time job for college students. There are several reasons as to why I agree to that statement Firstly, a student having a part time job while schooling gives the student an opportunity to learn how to handle multiple things at the same time. This is an essential skill which is very useful in the future when he graduates. Secondly, that student can earn extra income by himself. This will enable the student to learn to manage his own finances. He will start to think about his daily expenses and how he should spend them wisely. Thirdly, he can learn how the outside world operates; school is actually a protected environment. In order not to receive such a rude shock when coming out of the shell, students are best to undergo part time job or internships. Of course, the opposition would argue that the student might not be able to handle such stress at a young age, and may affect his studies during the part time job employment. Hence the saying goes, it is never too early or too late to start learning something new. One should always be prepared with the future.
