I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, they can not only release parents' pressure toward finance but learn how to manage their own salary; furthermore, they can be financial independent from parents gradually through part-time job. In addition, taking part-time job is helpful to learn the experience in the society. You have to check again and again and ask people who have managed the job for a long time before doing anything, such as understanding which tea is the professor's favorite before giving him the tea. What's more, college students can learn the attitude toward the work in the process of part-time job. For instance, college students can understand "apology" is the first thing they have to do when discovering that they do something wrong, it is beneficial to college students because they have to take advantage of the attitude when they attending job in the society. To conclude, taking part-time job is really beneficial to college students, they can not only earn money but train themselves how to manage their own salary; furthermore, college students can gain social experience from the part-time job, cultivating the serious attitude toward job in the future.
