Smoking is the act of inhaling and exhaling cigarette, tobacco, or other drugs. Based on the method of smoking, there are two types of smokers; the active smokers and passive smokers. Active smokers are those who smoke cigarette directly, while passive smokers are those who inhale smoke active smokers exhale. Researchers say that passive smokers' health could be damaged more than active smokers'. Children and pregnant women are two examples of passive smokers that are damaged the most. For children, it's because their organs, especially respiratory system, haven't developed well and relatively easy to get broken. Pregnant women should not be exposed to cigarette's smoke because they immediately affect the heart and blood circulation. In Indonesia, this sentence is printed on every cigarette pack as warning label: Smoking can cause cancer, heart attack, impotency, and problems during pregnancy as well as affects the health of the newborn. It should be clear that smoking is not good for our health. That's why the government should protect non-smokers or passive smokers from smoke's damage. Maybe it's still too extreme to ban smoking in whole country, but at least, smoking should be banned in public areas such as malls and restaurants. Thus, government has declared rule that said smokers must smoke in a smoking room. Those who want to smoke while eating could sit in a special room designed for smokers or those who doesn't mind inhaling cigarette's smoke, whilst those who want to avoid the smoke sit in a non-smoking room. But again, to fully protect our young generation from health degradation, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
