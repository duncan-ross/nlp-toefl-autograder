Part time job is a must for college students. Yes, it may be a burden but it also has lots of benefits. Here are some reasons why college students should engage theirselves in part time jobs. First of all. Due to extensive poverty and high tuition fees, not every parents can afford to send their sons and daughters to college. Inorder to solve the said problem, students may get a part time job to lessen thei parent's burden and for them to be able to go to college. Secondly. Students don't just earn money, But also experience which could be of a benefit for them. Involving theirselves in part time jobs helps them improve the following: Their communal skill/ social skills. Their time management strategies. And mostly their accountability. Lastly. Part time jobs are fun. You'll met new peers and you'll even know yourself better. It wont just help you get ready to face the real world, instead It'll also help you face the world with others.
