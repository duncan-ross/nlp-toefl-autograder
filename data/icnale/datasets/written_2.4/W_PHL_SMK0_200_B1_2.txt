Some have tried to quit but have returned to cigarettes because smoking is such a strong addiction. It is a habit that is very difficult to break. Smoking must be banned in restaurants because of many reasons one is for the satisfaction and cozy condition for visitors while eating, their relaxation and impression from his (the owner) place, the most important thing and he the owner should take care of their health ( banned the people who smoke in the restaurant), he should not allow them to smoke in a hall, where there's a lot of non-smokers. Because many people die in smoking even though other people dont smoke they die because of the bad environment or the smoke they inhaled. Restaurant must have division for non-smoking area and smoking area so that people will enjoy their meal and be comfortable while eating. Smokers must also be responsible for their actions and must also be concerned with others. People should not be indifferent to each others.
