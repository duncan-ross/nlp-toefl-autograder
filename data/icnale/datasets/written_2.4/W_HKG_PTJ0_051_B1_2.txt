Nowadays, most of the university students get a part-time job to earn money for their living, their family expenses, their spending on entertainment and so on. Some of them work in fast food shops and some of them work as a part-time tutor to help the primary school students. Most of the authorities claim that university students should concentrate on their studies more than having a part-time job. Is it important for university students to have a part-time job? After weighing both sides of the argument, I believe they should not have a part-time job. Some of my opinions will be demonstrated below. First of all, the government organizes different types of financial support to university students. Students need not to worry about the tuition fees. Furthermore, many charities raise fund for the poor students in the society. Therefore, they can apply for the support whether than having part-time job. It might also be noted that many students complain about the heavy workload on their studies. Actually, there are lots of assignments, projects and presentations on different subjects. I strongly believe that there is not enough time for the students to do them seriously. Therefore, part-time jobs definitely hinder their studies. Finally, Students should spend their time on doing community service such as doing volunteer work and joining some meaningful events organized by the universities. They should equip themselves to be a competitive person. In conclusion, there are many ways to solve the financial problems other than doing part-time job. For the reasons mentioned above, it is commonly believed that it is not that important for university students to have a part-time job.
