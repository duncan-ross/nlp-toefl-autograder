Whether doing part time job is good to university students or not? Many undergraduates have a mindset that they have become once they enter university. They think that it's their life and they may have power to set their route. Therefore, whether part time jobs are hood for university students, especially undergraduates definitely depends on the student himself. Normally, if students do part time jobs in summer vacation holiday, it won't do any harm to the students because they have plenty of free time. Therefore, doing part time job during summer holiday may help students to gain working experience from the society and won't affect their academic progress. However, if students do part time during semesters, it usually do more harm than good. The reason is that doing part time job will incepted student's academic progress, both physically and mentally. Physically, students use their time to study in exchange for the time doing part time job and mentally to said, doing part time job may exhausted student's fitness status, such as not enough sleep, rush life pace, etc. Therefore, normally students doing part-time job need a larger effort to study to retain their academic results. But whether this is good to students really depends, some may though that this kind of unfaithful harsh life style can be compensated by the money gained from their part time job. Therefore, it is hard to judge the answer for the question. To myself, doing part time really expands your visions and proficiency in suiting into the society, but it could be only done when time are available. As a student, studying is still our main purpose at this stage, doing part time is just an additional optional event to be done in the entire university life.
