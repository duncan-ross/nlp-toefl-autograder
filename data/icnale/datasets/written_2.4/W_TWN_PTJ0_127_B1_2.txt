I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. If you want to live, you need to work and have a job. Then you will have colleagues, which means that you need to work with some people you never met before. Almost every job you have to face no matter colleagues or your bosses every time, every day you work. So, it is really important to learn how to get along with people. Before you have a job after graduated you may have a part-time job first, not only for making money but also learning how to get along with people. What kind of part-time jobs you choose is also important. You can choose part-time jobs which relate to what you major in college, or other kinds that just for making money. Take myself for an example, I got a part-time job in a studio, which is painting and teaching kids how to paint. I love the job pretty much not only because the people and kids are nice but I love painting (though I'm not major in art). I can learn many things such as how to get along with kids and people, how to teach the basic skills of sketch and so on. For me, the most important is the experience I have.
