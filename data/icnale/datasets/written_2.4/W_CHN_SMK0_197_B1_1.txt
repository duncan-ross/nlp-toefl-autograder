Nowadays, there is increasing number of people smoking. Lots of smokers are smoking in restaurant. I think it's really a bad thing. I think everyone should know that smoking is not only a good habit but also not good for both the health of smokers and the health of people around them. So it's necessary to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, smoking in the public, especially places like restaurant, is a immoral behavior. It's really a bad experience that there has smoker around you when you were eating. I still remember a thing happened when I was young. When my family has a dinner together at a restaurant and a person beside us was smoking there and drives my whole family crazy. That's really bad I think. Because the restaurant not belongs to smokers. They must consider others' feelings, they must know they are in public, they must know there still a lot of people don't smoke. That's not a individual problem, but a social problem. If everyone cared about that, if everyone cared about others' feeling, they may not smoke in public. Unfortunately, it's impossible in this society. We must take strong measure to solve this problem. So smoking must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country immediately.
