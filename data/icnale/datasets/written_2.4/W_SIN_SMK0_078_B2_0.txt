There has been a noticeable increase in the anti-smoking campaigns across Singapore recently, in line with ever-increasing tobacco taxes imposed by the local government and a promotion for a cleaner and greener environment to deter people from smoking. The detrimental effects of smoking are also well known to many of us. As the ill effects from the smoke knows no boundaries, one might argue that the drifting of smoke from designated smoking areas in restaurants will still invariantly cause a health risk to neighboring patrons. Although the act of banning smoking at all restaurants across the country is understandable for the convenience of all, it is hard to agree that the act of smoking should be banned completely at eating establishments. For the smokers, smoking has become a way of life for them and it would be hard on them if government imposed laws were to eradicate all possible outlets for smokers to smoke in public. It may possibly also have a detrimental effect on society as smokers may find loopholes around the current system and create undesirable distress in public. As such, I believe that the current status quo of allowing smoking at restaurants is still acceptable, albeit in designated smoking areas.
