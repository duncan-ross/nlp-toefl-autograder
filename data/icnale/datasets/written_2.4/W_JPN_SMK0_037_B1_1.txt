I agree with this statement. I think this thought is expanding in Japan. Then I would like to tell you why I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, restaurants are places where we eat food. It means that we take something in our bodies. If smoking is not banned, we cannot avoid taking poison. Not only air through our noses but also foods through mouths. It is bad for our health. Second, delicious foods are spilled by smoke. For example, when I went to eat Italian restaurant, I found someone smoking. I really irritated. I thought that they broke this wonderful atmosphere. By smoking every delicious food, good music and comfortable atmosphere is broken. Third, recently we tend to ban smoking at restaurants. A lot of restaurants ban smoking at least at launch time, dinner and holiday. We should promote this action more. I think smoking is bad for our health not only smoker but also non-smoker if someone smoke at restaurants. Wonderful food, music, and atmosphere is broken by smoking. And we are promoting not to smoke at restaurants. So, I think smoking should be banned at restaurants. And I hope to ban that.
