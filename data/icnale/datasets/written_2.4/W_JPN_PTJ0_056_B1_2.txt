I think that it is good for students of a university to have a part-time-job. I have three reasons for this. First, it is a good opportunity to think how to work in the future. We can learn the manner of the way of speak or act. And we can understand how important working is. These days, many students are said like this "they don't think seriously about their future". So, I think that trying to join a job is very important for students of a university. Second, we can meet a lot of people through a part-time-job. Actually, I have a part-time-job as a waitress of the restaurant. Through my job, I have been able to meet various people such as students of other universities, the chef, customers and so on. Meeting many people and Knowing various way of think is really precious experience for me. I think that it same for students. Third, it will lead people to recognize the importance of money. Before I started to work, I didn't care about money. But when I earn money, I really understand how important it is. It may lead students to stop to waste money. For these reasons, if a student well know the importance of studying and good at using times, it is good for him or her to have a part-time-job.
