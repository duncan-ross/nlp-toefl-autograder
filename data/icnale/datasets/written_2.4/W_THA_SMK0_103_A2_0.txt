Have you ever seen somebody smoking when you are eating at restaurant? I really sure you are not like it, me either. I never like to see people smoke in the restaurants. I can barely stand on its smell and I feel that I am going to die because I can't take a breath. There is no one in this world want to smell toxic fumes from your cigarette. There are many places to smoke, for example, If you are having dinner and you need to smoke just go outside no one will abuse you for sure. In the restaurant. There are many children and if you smoking those children will get your toxic fume from your cigarette. How about if you smoking in air condition room, many people will smell your cigarette for sure. Lots of friends in university love to smoke cigarette when we have a break, some of them sit on the stairs and keep smoking. You know it's very bad look and its smell also goes around the building. Don't understand why they have to smoke. So the government should created a law to banned smoking in the restaurants. If there is no law about banned smoking in the restaurant anymore do you thing anyone want to go restaurant and eat food with toxic fume?
