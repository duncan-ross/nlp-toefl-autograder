There are some people who believed that smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants. However, as far as I concern, this is not an appropriate proposal. It is well known that smoking has negative impacts on our health, such as inducing cancers, being addictive, increasing the rate of heart attacks and possible teratogen to the fetus. Definitely, our society should control the production, sales and consumption of all smokes and suggest smokers to quit. But to simply ban smoking in all restaurants is not adequate. If we bears the principles of justice in mind, all human beings are born equal; by prohibiting smoking in all restaurants, we may please certain people but we may also offend the current smokers who want to enjoy catering in the restaurants. I suggest all the able restaurants to separate smokers and non-smokers by special seating designation and adding more ventilation. Thus both smokers and non-smokers can be severed well. For the other restaurants, they may decide to be whether non-smoking or not by themselves, and on their own risks. To limit the smoking in our society, there are many other efficient ways to be considered, but ban smoking in all restaurants isn't one of them.
