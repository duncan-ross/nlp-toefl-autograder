In my opinion, I'm strongly agree that the part-time job is important for college students. First, college students have more free time than other students, such as senior high school students and junior high school students. I think that we should make good use of time when we are free or weekends. Second, I don't plan to continue studying after I graduate. I want to work after I graduate so I should search some part-time job to promote my social experience and learn more things that we can't learn from school. Besides, I made a lot of friends from kinds of regions in my part-time job period and became more bravery and mature. I usually enjoy my job. By part-time job enhancing my relationship. Finally, I'm responsible for my tuition fee and entertainment fee. I' think we are able to make a few money by ourselves. Do part-time job can also release parents' pressure of economy. In summer vacation, more college students search part-time job. However, we have to watch out some illegal company. Be careful ourselves when we search part-time job. Most importantly, don't casually give your personal information to people that we just meet him. Though, part-time job can't make a lot of money, I get more something good from work. I always hold positive attitude to my every part-time job and enjoying it very much. So I agree this topic completely.
