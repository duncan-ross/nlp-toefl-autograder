I agree with it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In present have a part-time job a lot. Example they are salesperson in the bookstore department store, food shop and coffee shop, they are receptionist in the hotel, they are employees in the restaurant. College students have a free time. They spent time useful. They help parents about reduce money. when they want anything, they can buy as needed, without asking money from parents. So, they must know saving money. Education in present not in classroom only. We must study from outside and environment around us. I think life in reality is always interesting. There are a lot of thing to do for learn to live in society. They get skill and good experience from outside. They see many peoples. They learn about living with others life with purpose known adaption and new friends. It made them appreciate and recognize of money. They can work easy job for learning. They should more responsibility diligent and tolerance. They must to separate time for learning and working. A part-time job have benefits a lot, because of they can survey employment in future. College students can used subject of study be useful. They will proud of their ability.
