Lots of people say college life consists of four elements-schoolwork, love, part-time job, and club. Above all, part-time job, from my perspectives, is quite an indispensable part to make a college student mature and independent. Being not only financially but socially independent, college students indeed "earn" a lot by means of doing the part-time job. How to say? It is when students try to earn money and be responsible for their works that would really become a "half-adult" in the process of training and growing up. Because they are not socially and financially supported by family, they try to appreciate the real side of this society or world. They little by little know how hard it is to get so few pays especially after dedicating their whole energy, time, and some others things to their jobs, and they would then naturally never take getting allowance from parents for granted. On the other side, they might get socially independent under the cooperation and negotiation with their co-workers and boss. Learning how to manage their emotion and sentiment becomes a necessity to survive for them, and they must throw away their diploma no matter how well-educated they are. Meanwhile, EQ management is emphasized than IQ is, and the protection from family is no longer available. In a word, I must declare the importance of part-time job for college students, because what they learn by doing the part-time jobs can't be procured by parents in comparison. Hence, part-time job is like a filter, which would enforce the natural selection and make those who survive stronger and maturer.
