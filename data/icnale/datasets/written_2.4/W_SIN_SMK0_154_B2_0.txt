I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Singapore. It is an undeniable truth that smoking is harmful to health of not just the smokers themselves, but also those exposed to the second hand smoke. Toxins and chemicals within smoke include nicotine as well as other harmful substances that may cause lung cancer, heart disease and other unfavourable illnesses when inhaled. It is for the benefit of all other customers (especially non-smokers) that smoking is banned in restaurants. It is unhygienic for smoke to be consumed in restaurants as smoke can travel in air and contaminate food. It is unfair for fellow non-smoking customers to be exposed to harmful chemicals when they are not the ones who decided for themselves to consume cigarettes. Also, it would greatly improve the image of our country. Singapore is known as a clean and green city. Banning cigarette smoke would greatly improve the air pollution situation and result in fresher air and a better environment. This may in turn be beneficial to our economy as it may attract tourists to visit our country. Although the government has put in place measures to limit smoking, such as smoking zones in hawker centres, I feel that it is insufficient. In order to make a difference, smoking needs to be completely banned in all restaurants, especially air conditioned ones.
