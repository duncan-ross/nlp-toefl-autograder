I partly agree with the idea of banning smoking. Smoking is very harmful for not only smokers but also non-smokers. We can easily see people smoking on the streets. Why do you think they smoke on the streets? I think it's because there aren't enough smoking areas. Even though public places such as big buildings, restaurants, theatres, amusement parks have their own smoking rooms, it's still not enough. Government has been trying to ban smoking, but it's practically impossible. No matter how much government raises cigarette price, smoking population is still increasing. If we really can't stop people smoking, then we should let them smoke under some conditions. First, government should make the strict rules and laws. Non-smoking areas must be expanded, and smokers can only smoke in the smoking areas. Second, if smokers break the laws, they must be applied the strict punishment. However, I'm not pretty sure about banning smoking at all the restaurants. I guess if we ban smoking at all the restaurants, it'll make it worse. Smokers will go outside to the streets and try to find the place to smoke. I think we should find the best solution to protect non-smokers and give a little more comfort zone to smokers.
