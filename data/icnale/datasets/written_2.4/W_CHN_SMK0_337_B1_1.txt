 I have saw some adults even teens smoking in public places more than once. Actually, I am very against such behavior. As for myself, the smelling of smog makes me feel awful. Besides, there are lots of reasons proving that smoking should be forbidden in public places. First, it is reported that if a smoker is smoking in a room, the health of other people who would breath in the poisonous smog around the smoker will be affected. Meanwhile, when people smoke in the public places, the air of the public places will be polluted. So it is no wonder that some public places have set the smoking room or smoking zone. Even so, smoking in public places shouldn't be promoted. Second, I believe that everyone might know that smoking is bad for our health, but why do so many people cannot stop smoking? Because smoking can addict people easily. Once you have a try, you cannot reject it. So the forbid of smoking in public places is of great importance in the term of the health of civilian people. Third, sometimes many dangerous accidents are caused by smoking. For example, when you are smoking in the gas station, the spark of cigarette may set fire to the gasoline escaping from the fuel tank, and cause big explosion. Considering from people's health or the security of society, the advantages of smoking in public places are much more than the disadvantages. We shall forbidden the smoking in public places for a better future.
