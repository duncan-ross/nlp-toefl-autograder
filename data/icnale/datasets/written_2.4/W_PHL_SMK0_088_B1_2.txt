Smoking should be banned in restaurants due to some health reasons that can save a man's life. Imagine you are sitting in a restaurant and you don't enjoy your meal because of a gray smoke that is invading your face. Even though you don't want it you can still inhale it because of not banning smoking in a restaurant. Many Filipinos have experienced this kind of incident before, but due to lack of rules and regulations inside a restaurant you can't blame the person the person who is smoking. One more thing, smoking should be banned in restaurants because of the secondhand smoke that other people can inhale, which is more harmful to your health. Most of the restaurant bar that I have visited before has a separate space for the people who smoke so that the innocent lungs will not be involved. It is more appropriate rather than assembling it in a place. Even though you are not smoking, you can inhale it through the secondhand smoke. It should not just be banned in restaurants but it should also be banned in public places because the smoke of the cigarette can increase the pollution in our land. Restaurant isn't a place for smoking; it is a place for bonding and eating. According to Sarah Bernhardt, Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life. Dear Smokers, please stop smoking because if you don't stop, you are killing yourself.
