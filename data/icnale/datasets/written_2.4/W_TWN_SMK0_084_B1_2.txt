Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. I support the fact as there are too much first hand smokers affected the second hand smokers in the public and to the people's health. Especially the restaurant where you and your girl/boy friend are enjoying the dainty meal but ruins by a smoke, this should be very irritating. Not only the smoke should be banned, I think it should not be sold to the public! Variety of research found smoking harms whole bodies systems, from the first smoke you sucked in to the mouth and to your whole body circulations then to the organs. Lung systems dominate the defect; majority of lung cancers are caused by smoking and also oral cancers. That why now Taiwan's government are pushing the policy for prohibiting smoking so as you see any smokers in the public now, please tell them to throw it away. Even smoking should be allowed in the restaurant, they should at least divided into different areas to separate smokers and non-smokers to ensure non-smokers right. But in present I still see a lot of restaurant allowing smokers sitting with the non-smokers that means in the public area and this is not fair to the people who don't smoke and hopefully the government will refine this kind of problems.
