Many college students spend their free time in doing part-time jobs. And it has also become a kind of fashion. I think students do part-time jobs mainly for three reasons. First, some students do part-time jobs for money so that their material demand can be satisfied better. In this case, I don't think part-time job is necessary for students who already have a high living standard. To those students, part-time jobs may stimulate their desire for material things, and may ruin their study eventually. However, a proper part-time job will be good for students whose families are not wealthy enough to support them. I believe making money by themselves will make them feel good, and they may live a better life. Social experience is another reason. As we all know that most of us will face to the social after our graduation. By that time, it'll be hard for us to make a live only depend on what we've learnt in school. That is to say, social experience is also very important. We should know how this society works and how to meet the demand of the society. In this case, doing part-time jobs is a good way to learn about the society. By working with people outside school, students can gain a lot of social experience, which will lay a great impact on their future. There are also some students do part-time jobs only because they are interested in it. What they care about is not their pay but the fun they get during the part-time job. I think they should be encouraged if they really enjoy their part-time jobs. They can having fun, and even prove themselves. All in all, I think part-job should be encouraged as long as students' study is not affected by it. To those students who have spare time, doing part-time jobs is no doubt a good opportunity to learn something that can't be taught in campus.
