In my opinion, I agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is absolutely true that smoking is bad for a person's health. It's not necessary for people who don't smoke to breathe in the rooms which full of second-hand smoking. Especially the second-hand smoking is more poisoned than smoking. Restaurants are public space, and they provide a space for people to taste the delicious dishes. If you suddenly smell something strange, the smell may decrease your interest about the dishes. I believe most people would agree that when eating in the restaurants, the noise by other costumer's loud chat would bother you and make your feel annoyed, and so does the smell of second-hand smoking. The only different is that most of us dislike the former but many people who smoke are used to the latter. However, as what I mentioned before, restaurants are public place. The spaces are for everyone, not just for people who smoke (Excepts that you can find a restaurant only for people who smoke. ) Therefore, you can enjoy your cigarette after finishing the dinner anytime and anywhere in your own house, but just leave the restaurants or other public space free from the smoking. Do not make people who don't smoke worry about their dinner and their health.
