Nowadays, Just money from parents that we get everyday may not enough for us to survival and doing daily routine. In one day we use money to doing many activities such as eating, pay for buy or taxi to university; some of student also pays money for playing games and their girl friend. So they need to find another ways to have money not just from their parent, and that way is to have a pat time job. Some of college students have a part time job when they have free time to make money. I agree with them because we can ease burden from our parent and using free time to make a benefit. They job can be service, cashier at restaurant or supermarket, some of them are smart can be a tutor teach other student when it nearly exam. We can choose part time job from our skills and abilities. I think it up to them; if their parent has good status and rich, they don't have to do a part time job. But for other students that their parent has lower status and money in each day is not enough, they need to survive and help themselves. Students that have part time job need to manage their time for working and learning.
