Smoking is a bad behavior. Most people know clearly how smoking harmful to people. However, there are many smokers still do harmful behavior to their body. Smokers are hurt their body when they are smoking and they hurt other people who are near them at the same time. It is unethical to make other people's body hurt, especially in the public space. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Restaurants are the place people eating their meats; most people did not like the feeling of smoke when they are eating. The smoke may make people uncomfortable and do not want to eat. It is bad for people if they eat last, they do not have enough energy to work. This important topic causes some business bout the development of all country. Smoking should be completely banned at not only in the restaurants but also all public space in the country, including parks, roads, stores, and so on. The reason why these place must be notice carefully is that there may the place for healthy people to relaxing. There are many children and their parents playing together at these places. It is not good for children if they feel the smoke. It is harmful to the children. In sum, people who like to smoke which means they like to harm their bodies. They decided to harm their body but they can't and have no right to harm other people's bodies, so they can't smoke in any public place, restaurant included.
