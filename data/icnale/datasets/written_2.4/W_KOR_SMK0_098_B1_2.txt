These days many restaurants are ban smoking or divide smoking room and nonsmoking room. It doesn't make big difference but there are lots of restaurants even don't divide room. I absolutely agree that all the restaurants completely ban smoking. I'm more agreeing because I'm nonsmoker but its common opinion for nonsmoker. Nonsmokers are more than smokers, for example, there are children, students, old men, and pregnant women. In restaurants, there is also more nonsmoker than smoker. If smokers are smoking in the restaurants, many nonsmokers are effected their health indirectly. Secondhand smoking is harmful their health. It's well known fact that secondhand smoking is caused cancer, and more harmful than smoker. Its irony that smoking in restaurants even if many people have a meal. In my case, I hate smell of smoke, and sometimes if I smell during have a meal, I don't want to eat a meal anymore. It's smoker's freedom but at least they don't damage other people. Fortunately, these days many restaurants, theater, and the inside of a building are ban smoking, or divide smoking room and nonsmoking room. Many smokers, however, are still smoking in bar, in the street, etc. It's very unpleasant for nonsmoker. I think that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant. If our country does, we guarantee freedom of smoker, and keep right to protect health and breathe in the fresh air.
