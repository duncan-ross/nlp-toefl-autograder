 China has a large number of smokers. Many young boys and girls have the habit of smoking; some of them are middle school students. Even plenty of smokers have stepped into the restaurants. Most of nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon and the same to me. I hold the view that smoking should be banned especial at the restaurants. I clearly know that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to our health More and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. Admittedly, the smokers want to eliminate their pressure and relax themselves. Hanging a cigarette at the corner of the mouth makes them feel right and sure. The key to issues is they should not hurt other's feeling, while smokers should not pollute the clean air at the restaurants and do harm to others. Second-hand smoke is almost as medically hazardous to exposed non-smokers as it is to the smoker. All in all, I strongly advocate banning smoking in public. Not only is it good for the smokers themselves but also do their great contribution to our human being and our green world.
