In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details. Generally, young people have many important tasks to do in schools. They have to study several stressful subjects and join in a lot of helpful activities. Personally, I think that although teenagers work hard in schools, they need to have jobs to get a great experience that they can never found in schools. First of all, to help their parents, young people should do part time jobs. Nowadays, many businesses provide suitable positions and reasonable income for students. For example, I used to work with Mc Donald as a cashier when I was a student in high school in Bangkok. This position required me to work 21 hours per week and paid me about 700 baht. With this money, I could have an expense for traveling cost from my home to my school. It might not large money, but I felt proud that I could help my parent with this money that I belonged. Finally, not only can teenagers learn how to work with other people, they can also learn what they actually like. The more jobs they participate in the more chances they obtain to know different characters of different jobs. Moreover, they can plan what they have to learn that will be useful for their favorite jobs. Therefore, students who work and study together will not do any mistake about choosing their appropriate career like other lazy students who never paid any attention for a part time job.
