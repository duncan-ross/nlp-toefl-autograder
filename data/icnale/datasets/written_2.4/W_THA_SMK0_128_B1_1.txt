I strongly agree with that because it is very dangerous for smokers and environs. Smoking is becoming a big problem at this time. There are a lot of people to smoke. Nowadays new smoker and women smoke increasingly. They spend a lot of money in order to buy cigarettes. I don't know the advantages of cigarettes. I know many disadvantage them. Although they have a lot of cancers, people still smoke. Actually smoking must be strictly prohibited everywhere. Other people don't want to smell the smoke of cigarettes during do something. I feel bad when someone smokes near me. If I were wizard, I would not have cigarettes in the world. Everybody feels good and healthy. The restaurants will be a pleasant place to use the service and the customers will very enjoy and feel joyful with the taste of delicious food. The smokers should be aware of the effects of the smoking. If they think carefully, they will realize how the smoking damage their bodies and others. In the restaurants, it is absolutely a place for non toxic areas, thus, the air should be fresh and smell clean. That's why I think it is dangerous to allow people to smoke in this area.
