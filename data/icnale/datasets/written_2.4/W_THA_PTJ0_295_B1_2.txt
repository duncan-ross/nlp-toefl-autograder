It is not until I realize that being a college student you have more free time to do many things outside classes because you don't need to attend classes haft day long like studying in high school. Therefore, to have a part-time job or joining other activities in your colleges, I think it is useful for college students as they can learn many things that are not taught in classes. Learning something new outside classes and making money while studying are two main reasons why part-time job is important for college students. The first main reason why part - time job is beneficial is that students can learn how to work while they are studying in colleges. They can get prepared for a real job in the future because students can use their knowledge taught in classes to deal with their jobs. And I agree it is better students can practice what they have learned from classes to a real situation. When students graduate, they will not get only diploma but a lot of experiences. This will be great for them when going to apply for jobs in the future. The second reason is that students can make money themselves and don't need to ask for much money from their parents. In addition, I personally think that students will spend money more carefully because they know it is difficult to earn money. As a result, they can save more money for their education. Finally, if you have more free time after classes, let get a part-time job to get prepared for a better job in the future. You do not only learn something new outside classes but also you will be proud of yourself that you can make money while studying in college.
