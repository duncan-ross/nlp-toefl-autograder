I think that it should be banned in all public places in Japan and not just restaurants. For a start, we already know that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease and strokes. We also know that second hand smoke can cause disease not to mention that it also affects the elderly, children and pregnant women as well as just being annoying to those that don't smoke. Restaurants should be a place where people can enjoy their food without having to worry about catching diseases or being uncomfortable sitting in the same room as smokers. While it is every person's right to choose to smoke or not, surely smokers can go without a cigarette for an hour or so while eating out. We know that not smoking doesn't offend others or threaten lives whereas smoking does. So in fact, there really shouldn't be any debate about it at all. If smokers don't care about their own well being than the Japanese Government should at least show some concern about the welfare of its' non smoking population and put safeguards, also read as laws, in place to protect them. That way, it also sends a positive message to children and reinforces the dangers of smoking. If people want to smoke, then let them smoke in areas that will not adversely affect the innocents who don't smoke.
