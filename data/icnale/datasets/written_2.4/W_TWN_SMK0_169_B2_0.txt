I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to lots of research, smoking is bad for human beings, especially for our lungs which would turn into black and become cancer after long period of smoking. Moreover, it is said that when people who do not smoke breathe in the smoke that smoker pop out, they suffer much more from the smoke than people who smoke do. Therefore, plenty of innocent people who do not smoke or hate the smell of the smoke can not stop themselves breathing in the smoke if the public places do not ban smoking insides. That would cause more and more people suffer from cancer or other diseases, and then, for long period of time, it would also have serious influence on the nation's development. Nowadays, due to the regulation of governments, smoking is nearly banned at all the restaurants, which makes all people enjoy their meals much more. Besides, if the smokers really need to smoke, they can smoke outside the restaurants as well, which would not only give more respect to other customers, but also make all the smokers get away from all the "staring" and enjoy their meals at ease. That is indeed a win-win situation for both sides. To conclude, for the sake of health and respect, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
