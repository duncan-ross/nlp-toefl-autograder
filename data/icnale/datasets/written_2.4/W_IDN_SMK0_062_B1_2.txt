Smoking is a bad habit that give no benefit at all to the one who smoked and the people surround him who smell it. Recently, the smoker is not only a men, but also a women. Although it has already banned by the government to smoke in public area, there are a lot of people who still smoking in public area, such as Hospital, mall, airport, terminal, even restaurant. Restaurant is not a correct place to smoke at all, because that is a place where food should not be contaminated with kind of killer things like that. People can be disturbed, even get sick because of that smoke. The smoke contain a lot of killer material inside, such as Nicotine, CO2, etc. And not only that, Smoking can cause impotency, cancer, lungs disease, even dead. What a horrible damage that caused by a selfish habit of smoking people. I think Smoking should be banned at all of the restaurant in the country before it getting worst and causing a dead. The world will be a better and comfort place, if the smoking people can stop their habits or at least they can do it in a right time and in a right place.
