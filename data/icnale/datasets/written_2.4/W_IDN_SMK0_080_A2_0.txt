Smoking is unhealthy activity which has bad effect to the person who smoke ( active smoker ) and the person who does not smoke but breath the smoke of smoking person ( passive smoker ). The bad effects of smoking to passive smoker are more dangerous than to the active smoker. Because statement is scientifically proven. Moreover smoking in the restaurant is not suitable with the place it self. Restaurant is the place for the people who buy and eat food. So if there is smoking person while we are eating automatically the smoke will disturb us. The smoke also pollutes the environment. In biology we know that the smoke that goes out of the smoker's mouth and so if passive smoker will get the more dangerous effect because the active smoker just breath and few of the smoke. So smoking is dangerous for the smokers and other people in the restaurant who do not smoke. Not only that, although there is smoking room in the restaurant and hopefully all customers who are smokers will smoke in that room. But in reality smoking room is useless because the smokers who want to buy food in the restaurant, they not obey to the rule with smoking inside of restaurant.
