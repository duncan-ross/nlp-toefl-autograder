It is important for college students to have a part time job because they have higher spending's then when they are in secondary school. Not only that, parents are not able to support them for their high expenses like having more expensive food, going out more often, and buy more expensive clothes, etcetera. Since most college students will be working once they graduate, by getting a part time will give them some experience what working life is like. Many students who have not worked before and start working full time once they graduate they will have some trouble blending into the working life, plus they are working full time, meaning that their upper in-charge will expect more from them compared to a part timer. Many a time students like to get out of the study life, maybe learn to drive or catch movies. And especially when they gets a boyfriend or girlfriend, they tend to spend even more. They need a lot of money and most parents would not give them too much allowance money. Hence the best solution is to work part time and enjoy what they earned. Working part time has no negative outcome because they can choose their working schedule so they can choose to work more or less. They also can experience what working life is like before working full time into the working industry. And the best part is that they can enjoy what they earned!
