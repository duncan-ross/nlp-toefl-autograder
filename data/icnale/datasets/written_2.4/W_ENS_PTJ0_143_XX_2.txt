I agree and believe that it should be a mandatory requirement for all students in order to graduate. Many more students are graduating each and every year and they are finding out the hard way about the differences between the more relaxed environment of college as opposed to the harsh reality of the often cruel and unforgiving, workplace. I believe that a lot of students have no idea about the complexities of getting and keeping a job other than what they have read in career brochures or been advised about by some well meaning college counselor. At the very least, they would have some of idea of the most basic responsibilities required from employees by employers and be better prepared to accept those responsibilities in a mature, adult fashion. They need to learn and learn quickly, that if they intend to survive and succeed in their respective new environments, then they had better wake up and smell the coffee before taking a huge nosedive because of some trivial (to them) issue such as completing their assigned daily tasks in a professional and orderly fashion. I have only been in the workforce a short time myself, but I learned very quickly because I had the advantage of having had some previous experience working part-time.
