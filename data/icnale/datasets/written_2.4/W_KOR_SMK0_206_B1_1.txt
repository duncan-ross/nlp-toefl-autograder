I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons for me to agree that issue. First, secondhand smoking is more serious than smoking. Because of the component of cigarette smoke, it is announced that secondhand smoking is more harmful to health than smoking. So non-smokers are affected smoking more than smokers. Second, smoking cause damage to other people. When we are in the restaurants where there are smokers, our clothing and hair smelled cigarette. Also if there are smokers in the restaurants, restaurants are full of cigarette smoke. The smell of smoke is very harmful to non-smokers. In my family, everyone is non-smoker. That is why I am sensitive to smoke. Thus I smell cigarette very well and quickly. I am unpleased if he or she smokes in the restaurants, so that restaurants are full of cigarette smoke and cigarette smell. Smoking not only gives unpleased feeling to non-smokers, but also is harmful to health. For that reason, smoking is bad thing. Therefore, if he or she wants to smoke, they must smoke outside the restaurants or smoking room in the restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
