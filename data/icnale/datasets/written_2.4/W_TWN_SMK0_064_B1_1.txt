I think it will be pleasure for many people if smoking is being completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I cannot agree with the issue anymore. And I hate smoke, too. Why I hate smoking so much? Every time when I see there was somebody smoking, I always keep a distance from them. Because I'm allergic to the smoke. Once I'm under the circumstances of the second hand smoke, I feel very uncomfortable. That why I hate smoking. Besides my personal feeling, I think smoking in public places is some what a bad manner. One can enjoy the happiness of smoking, but others may not feel in the same way. Every one should put themselves in others' shoe; our society would be more and more kind. But there is a little who will be so kind to everybody. So, I think the exist of this restriction dose needed. That's how I feel about this topic. If someday we could live in a place without smoking, I think the problems of health would reduce more than ever. Because smoking is very harmful to our body. And there is no reason for the necessarily of smoking. We should try to construct a world of no smoking.
