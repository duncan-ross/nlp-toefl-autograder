Smoking is an activity that is very difficult to be in residence by a smoker. I personally do not believe that smoking is good for health. Common efforts to stop smoking is often less effective. And even more bizarre, smoking cessation is often produced results just the opposite, actually strengthens the habit of smoking. Regarding smoking in public places should be completely prohibited, such as restaurants, I strongly agree because smoking in public places will lead to people who do not participate will be exposed to smoking negative effects of cigarette smoke such as respiratory disease and also interfere with the comfort of public places. Even smokers already know what the impact of smoking such as cancer and heart disease and respiratory disease but still smoke, it's good if you are the smokers want to smoke in public places should use the places that already provide the government such as a room for smoking, it's good to smokers, to get out and make a deal with smokers and smoking is in a place that has provided this is also to maintain clean air enjoyed by non-smokers. That's better, more thoughtful, and fair, instead of demanding others to get out of a dependency that is difficult on the left.
