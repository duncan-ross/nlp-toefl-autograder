I think smoking at restaurants should be banned because it's public places, it not only effects to the smokers but it effects to non smoker at present there. Besides, many children may interested of the act of smoking and try to copy it which may later develop into a habit. Smoke which increase when a person smokes a cigarette is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and last but not the least carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. Government should be set restaurants in the country be banned smoking strictly or my opinion, the restaurant should divide two zones for smoker and non-smoker. Customers should decide that they want to avoid smoke, they should choose the room which not smoking if he is smoker will be other room. And the importance, smoking in public areas is not occur because the smoking behavior will be the example for a youngster and them may try smoke and giving birth to a new generation of smokers finally. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy platform for the youth it is not only our duty but everyone should focus the bad point of smoke more and more.
