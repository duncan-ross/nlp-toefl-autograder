Needless to say, we are all familiar to the hazards of smoking. We know that smoking is bad to our health; it contains dangerous chemicals like Nicotine that can cause serious damage to our health and various complications which can result to death. Nevertheless people still persist on smoking despite the fact that they are damaging their health. But sadly, not only do they compromise their health, but also the others around them because the smoke they emit from cigarettes are more deadly, this is what we call second-hand smoking. I do believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants all over the country. This does not only make non-smokers comfortable, but it also promotes good health to others by not making them smoke whenever they want. But this presents a great risk to the restaurants ' owners if most or even some of its customers are smokers. If they, for instance, cannot smoke at a certain non-smoking restaurant, they might tend to look for other places to eat where they could freely smoke. To resolve this dilemma, I think restaurants should have their own smoking areas for the comfort of both the smokers and non-smokers. That is why this issue should be addressed with serious caution because not only the government is held responsible but also the private sectors controlling these restaurants.
