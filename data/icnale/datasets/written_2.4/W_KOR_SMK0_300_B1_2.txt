These days in Korea, a big issue is a policy against smoking in public places such as bus stations, public buildings, parks and every public spots. According to this policy, smokers must do not smoking general restaurants as well as all sorts of public places. Most smokers say that it is not fair. However, I definitely think that smoking at the restaurant must be prohibited in country. First, smokers should not forget that the restaurant is the public place. Especially, people of all ages and gender visit here to eat some food for their health and rest. If only one person is unpleasant by a smoker in the restaurant, the smoker's behavior is inconsistant with this space. In the second place, second-handing smoking is a big health hazard in the closed place such as the restaurant. I think it is the most serious ploblem. Many reports show that second-handing smoke can be harmful more than direct smoking, and smoking rooms for smokers and nonsmokers in restaurants are not effective. Finally, the restaurant is the place to eat food above all things. Most people are going to the restaurant for a meal, and they want a smoke-free environment. All of the restaurants are pulic place where nonsmoker's rights should be the first consideration. For the all these reasons, I say that smoking should be prohibited completely in all restaurant in country.
