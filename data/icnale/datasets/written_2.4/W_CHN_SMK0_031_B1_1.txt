Nowadays smoking is banned in public places in more and more countries. And there is a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Personally, I think it inadvisable to smoke in a restaurant. It is universally recognized that the cigarette contains a considerable number of harmful elements. Smoking may not only do harm to the smokers themselves but also to the people around them. So if a person is smoking while others are eating, the eaters will be greatly annoyed. No non-smokers want to be bothered by cigarette smoke. And it will be a piece of good news for them if all the restaurants go smoking free. But I am of the opinion that there should be smoking sections in some restaurants. It is hard for heavy smokers to quit smoking in a short time. If all the restaurants forbid smoking, they may get really uncomfortable. In general, smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants. Restaurants can set non-smoking areas and smoking areas for different customers. But I think that if smoking is permitted, it should always be in an area that non-smokers do not have to go through because no non-smokers want to expose themselves to second hand smoke.
