Generally speaking, it's a high developed society that students all over the world are increasing their competitions every day. Therefore I suggest that college students who have a part time job is one of the ability to strengthen themselves. First, students who have a part time job can learn much more things than they've learn from college professors. Take cram school teacher as an example, they'll realized how difficult a teacher be or how many preparing works that a teacher should do. It's very hard to imagine how things have been done if we never be part of it. Second, by taking a part time job during the student life is a good way to know and enhance themselves to be a better person. They might face different situations that they never thought before in the classroom. Moreover, some of the part time jobs for students requires face to face toward thousands of customers. The more people you contact with the more you'll feel how small and special you are. Final and the most important one is that students who have a part time job can make lots of friends. Quan-si relationship is one of the most important networks for people to become richer or powerful. People you meet might become a millionaire in the next day or she might be president's daughter. Anyhow, friends can always help you whenever you need help.
