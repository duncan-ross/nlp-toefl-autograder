In my first response, I made the mistake of letting my personal opinion on the matter over ride what really matters which is the opinion of the majority. I believe that the majority of people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants, and if this is true in Japan, then smoking should be banned in restaurants there too. Many people probably believe that smoking should be banned at restaurants due to the numerous health concerns that accompany smoking in any location. Smoking is directly related to cancer, and the number of deaths each year as a result of tobacco use is nothing less than staggering. Furthermore, it is a matter of simple respect to behave yourself in a restaurant and not do things that will cause a problem for the other customers. This goes not only for smoking but for talking too loudly, being rude to the restaurants staff, etc. For the record, I would like to state that I do not personally believe it is appropriate to ban smoking at restaurants anywhere. This is because smokers have just as much a right to be there as anyone else, but I do think there's a problem with smokers that smoke in restaurants that are more oriented towards families. In conclusion, the people as a majority will decide whether or not the restaurants should ban smoking in Japan.
