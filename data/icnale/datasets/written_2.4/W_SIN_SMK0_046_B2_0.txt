 The facts about smoking are out there, public knowledge, clear for all to see. Smoking causes lung cancer, destroys the health of new-borns (when the pregnant mother smokes), reduces stamina, stains teeth, and the list goes on. It's not just the smokers who suffer these ill effects; anyone who is subjected to the inhalation of the smoke also has the potential to suffer these same effects in a similar capacity. The problem with smoking is that it cannot be effective contained within any particular area. The smoke flows like the wind; it is not sucked away by fume hoods over stoves. Why do governments persist with allowing smoking in the first place given that there are no health benefits? Is the money brought in by the tobacco companies worth more than the health of its citizens? That is looking more the case with every smoking related death. All restaurants should ban smoking within their premises. In a world that is trying to push for healthy living from eating right, then perhaps the next logical step is to promote healthy breathing too. The absence of smokers in these eating places will bring economic benefits as well. Many non-smokers and those who cannot stand the fumes from smokers will then be able to enjoy the food offered at these restaurants. If a restaurant wants to allow smoking in its premises, then it should be a smokers-only venue. This economically unviable option would cause all businesses to follow suit and ban smoking indefinitely. Just like no one should be subjected to unwilling sexual assault, no one should be subjected to unwilling lung assault by these toxic fumes too.
