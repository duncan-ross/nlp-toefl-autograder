For the most part, I would agree. It would help to alleviate a lot of financial burdens that many people are suffering and also boost student's confidence when it comes time to graduate because they would feel better having had some form of work experience under their belts before approaching employers. They would also have picked up some elementary work skills and have a better insight into working full-time by taking these hands on approach. Students need to take care though and ensure that they do not neglect their study or assignments. An organised, common-sense approach will be necessary to keep their time evenly balanced and their study commitments on an even keel. If possible, they should attempt to find work within the sector that they intend working in upon graduation. This will help ease the doors of employment open slightly, more than if they had no experience or were working in a non-relevant field prior to graduation. In addition, I would say that it is also important to keep some sort of social schedule as well. It is very easy to feel overwhelmed and consumed by it all if all the student is doing is working and studying without sufficient'time off'.
