Nowadays, numerous college students are already working. Especially for less fortunate, when they have to support their own schooling and worse, support their own families. They sacrifice their supposed to be student life just to be able to help. But working while still studying is difficult as students lose focus on their studies. Whether to work or not while still in school actually depends on one's situation. Students who have part time jobs tend to be lax in their studies and make their studies their second priority. Their mind set is to earn money, especially when they have to bring food to their dining table everyday. Actually schools now make it easier for students to study while working, considering the poverty level in our country. Schools now give students the luxury to choose their own schedule in school which will not conflict their working schedules, the reason why most students these days already consider working at an early age. Studying and working concurrently would, however, make the students less focused and stressed. Looking at it at a different perspective, working students give value to money at an early age, as they know how hard money is earned. They learn how to budget, save for rainy days and be wise in spending. On the contrary, looking at it from the point of view from well-off families, which, of course, comprised a smaller chunk of our population, they prefer their children to focus first on their studies. By doing this, they can concentrate more, they can bring home good grades and finish their college on time without being too stressed and without sacrificing their health. Anyway, giving value to money can be taught to children at home. Whether or not to work while in school actually depends on the personal drivers.
