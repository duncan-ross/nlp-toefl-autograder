Some of us are continuing to college after we graduate from high school. It is a common scene that we see some college students are working for part time job. The question now is, is it important for them to get a part time job? I, in my own opinion, agree with this, because it can give us a working experience and can give us income by our self. When we study at college, majority are study so that we can get a job. Sometimes there are company and owner that appreciates working experience. So, it is common for us that having a work experience to get a job, for instance become a waiter. This could give us an experience how should we work, how to please our boss, and so on. In the future, when we work as a professional, we know how should behave like a professional employee. Studying at college needs a lot of money. For this, many parents still give us a money for it. In the other hands, there are poor students that needs to work for the money by him/herself. Part time job is a good way to earn it, as we not yet becoming professional of our subject. It could give us our own income, so we don't have to bother our parents for buying that or paying that. For conclusion, part time job is important. It can give you an experience about job and you can earn your own income. If you are a college student, don't get embarrassed about part time job. Your parents would we proud of you for getting your own income. You should try it.
