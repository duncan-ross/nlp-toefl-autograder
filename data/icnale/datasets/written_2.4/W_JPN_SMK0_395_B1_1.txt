I disagree with this statement. I have heard a good idea about this problem. This idea is called Bun-en. This idea is that completely separating nonsmokers and smokers. By this idea, nonsmokers don't absorb smoke and smokers can smoke. But, this idea has a defect. Some people say that this idea is difficult to carry out so that nonsmokers might not smoke and that nonsmokers may absorb smoke. Of course, this is right. However, in many restaurants, we will not absorb smoke. Why? There are walls between nonsmokers and smokers in many restaurants. And in my opinion, smokers have rights to smoke. So we cannot easily ban smoking in all restaurants. But don't forget. Smoking is unhealthy for not only smokers but also nonsmokers, because nonsmokers absorb smoke which smokers make. So it is needless to say that smokers must not smoke if they are sitting in the restaurant which cannot completely separate nonsmokers and smokers. Most important thing to do this idea is that everyone understand this idea and the defect of this idea and corporate. If there are no understanding, the restaurant owner cannot make walls. If smokers smoke in the restaurant which separate nonsmokers and smokers but nonsmokers can absorb smoke, some nonsmokers may say Because we allow smokers to smoke restaurant, we absorb smoke. So smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants! In this way, everyone have to understand this idea and the defect. If they do this, all people will enjoy their lives.
