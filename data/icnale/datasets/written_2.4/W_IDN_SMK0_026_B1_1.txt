I believe that is a good way to less more pollution at everywhere. Smoking at restaurants should be banned because it is indeed a serious problem and dangerous not only for smokers themselves, but also for passive smokers. A cigarette is like a toxin hypermarket. You can find many kinds of toxin in it: acetone, tar, arsenic, toluene, etc. The tar itself contains more than forty three substances that can cause cancer. Scientists say that when we are smoking, we put many toxin materials into our body. Smoking not only destroy the smoker active, but also the passive smoking. The smoke that is suck by the passive smoking as mainstream smoke, even if that out continuously from the top of the smoke is called sidesteam smoke. The sidestream smoke has a big influence for the health of passive smoking because it has a lot of influence and the strength from the danger is very high. The risk of the health by the passive smoking almost same with the active smoker. So do not smoking to keep healthy our body and to prevent of lung cancer. Therefore I agree smoking should be banned.
