I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In a restaurant, a gentleman dressed in western-style clothes snags his fingers and asks the waitress, handing several pounds to her. What he said to the waitress? Can you help me buy a pack of cigarette? what described above is a common phenomenon in majority of the restaurants. You may affect by those people when having a dinner with your friends or family. Every customer should have his own right in public. Let alone a restaurant. In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. To begin with, smoking has a bad effect on the people around our both the mental and physical. The mental effect, as we can know smoking is the main cause of the lung cancer. To the smoker, it is a killer. To the people around the smoker, smoking may cause some unexpected changes in their mental ability. Take a little baby for example, if a smoker sits close to a mother with a baby in the restaurant, the baby may cry and shout out. What a unfortunate baby, what's the physical effect? For example when you see a handsome smoking, do you imagine his behavior will be an indication that boy should smoke if they want to be more cool. Several countries have designed laws to ban the smoking in public. This trend indicates people's requirement. All in all we should ban the smoking in the restaurant caring about other people around you.
