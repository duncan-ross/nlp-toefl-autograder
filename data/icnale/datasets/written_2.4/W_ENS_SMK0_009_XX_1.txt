I don't really care if all the restaurants in Japan ban smoking or not. I have never been to Japan, and I don't really see myself going at any point in the future, so for all I the care they can do whatever they want to do. But, I hope that one day they ban smoking at all the restaurants in my home in South Carolina. Down here in the south, I think that a lot more people smoke than in other areas of the country, and I also think this is a primary reason for the port image of southern health. Sure, we eat a lot of fried foods and drink a lot of sweet tea, but a lot of people smoke down here even though they know it is bad for them. Everyone knows that smoking gives you cancer, so I don't understand why anyone does it anymore. Finally, smoking is an expensive habit over time. I saw a TV show where they say that the average smoker will spend almost $100, 000 over their life if they smoke just one pack a day. That's a lot of money that could be much better spent on a lot of other things. In conclusion, more people should try to stop smoking.
