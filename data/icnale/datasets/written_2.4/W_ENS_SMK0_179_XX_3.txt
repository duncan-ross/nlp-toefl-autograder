All restaurants ban from smoking? You're joking right? Sounds like a lot of tosh to me but hey, stranger things have happened. Last I heard, Japan's voters, the majority of who are smokers, weren't too keen on that idea and cracked it down. I could have got it wrong of course and maybe it will happen. I'd support it for sure because we are used to it where I come from. Smoking bans that is. If we want to have a fag, then outside is the place to go unless they have special rooms in London for the gentleman's clubs. The only little pubs and restaurants that I were in when I was in Japan were all stuffy, cramped little places where it was hard enough to find a seat without trying to breathe as well. We need to think of the little ones you know. It's the kids we don't want to get started on smoking and it would be nice to take them to a clean air restaurant in Tokyo one day. Especially in winter when it's nice to stay indoors and stay warm without having to worry about the stink or my kids' health. Anyway, I hope Japan goes ahead with it.
