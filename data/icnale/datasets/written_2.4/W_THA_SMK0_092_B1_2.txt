Smoking Now a day, the numbers of the smoking people increase double from the past. Many people ask me that smoking is good? Or why we have to smoking, my parents always tell me that smoking is not good for our health and it can be harmful to others and our world. The problems of greenhouse effect have many reasons one of them is smoking. Today there are some 1. 1 billion people still smoking that making air pollution. When someone smoking, it makes surrounding pollute and the people near the smoker will receive the toxic fumes so they are going to be the cancer. Smoking doesn't have any benefits it has only disadvantage. Some people are upset when they are near the smoker. Many smoking people are dead before they grow old. As the summary, I agree with the topic that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. If not, there must be two zones for smokers and normal customers. The customers that don't smoke will take their time to enjoy their food, and smokers will enjoy their smoking without destroy other people. The restaurants should be very strict not to let the smokers to smoke inside the non smoking area. Anyway, I think we shouldn't sell the cigarettes, shouldn't import or export or product cigarettes. I don't see any advantages from cigarettes and smoking but why many people love to smoke, I just don't understand.
