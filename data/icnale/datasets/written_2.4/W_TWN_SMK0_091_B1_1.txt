I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country because it is not fair for the people who are smoking. People who like smoking go to the restaurants but are banned to smoking. How they felt? Where they can go having a good meal? Another reason that I don't agree is the government doesn't bane people smoking. Because of that why can we completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The government allows that people keep smoking but want they don't smoke in the public. I don't think it's logic. It is just really unfair for me when thinking about people want smoking anywhere. Although smoking is really bad for people, you don't bane it completely; you can't bane people smoke in where they want. If you allow them to smoke, you have let them smoke everywhere. You make them don't smoke in the restaurants, and it is against the law of personal right. So I don't agree that be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree that should be completely banned smoking in the country. If every people don't smoke, the earth and people in the earth may become healthier. Our life may become clearer; it's not only in the restaurants.
