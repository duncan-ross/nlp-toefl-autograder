Smoking laws have always been a hotly debated topic in Singapore. It is true that smoking is detrimental to the health of the smoker and everyone around, but the smoker also argues that it is in his own right and freedom in which he choses to do what he wants. As smoking bans are popping up virtually everywhere in the country, smokers find it more and more difficult to find places where they can smoke, legally. This is actually the intended effect of the government --- for smokers to smoke less/stop smoking because of the huge inconvenience factor. Referring to smoking bans in restaurant, I believe that following the general smoking ban requirements; all indoor restaurants should completely ban smoking. It is unfair for other guests to put up with the smoke and subject their health to risks simply because of other inconsiderate smokers. In fact, a large number of non-smokers actually detest the smell of smoke. However, pertaining to individual rights, I believe that some outdoor restaurants could cordon off an area for smokers. This way, both sets of people have a right to do things which are of their interest. Therefore, I do not believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
