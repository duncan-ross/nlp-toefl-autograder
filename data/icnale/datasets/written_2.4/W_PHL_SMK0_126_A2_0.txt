Smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker; it is a public health hazard. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous to people with pre-existing conditions. We all know that smoking is very dangerous to our health and it can have a lot of effects in our body. But even though we know that it is not good to us, many people still can't avoid using it. For example, on public restaurants, I observed that many people were smoking. I agree that smoking on public restaurants should be banned due to the following reasons: First, of course, it is bad to our health. Second, it is not nice that when someone is smoking, some people are smoking. Most people hate it and for others, it is a sign of disrespect. And lastly, it is considered as a bad manner. Banning smoking in restaurants has thus proven an excellent measure for keeping clean various pipes in musical instruments as well as in humans. Smoking can't give us any benefits so as much as possible, people who were smoking should avoid it if they still want to have a healthy lifestyle.
