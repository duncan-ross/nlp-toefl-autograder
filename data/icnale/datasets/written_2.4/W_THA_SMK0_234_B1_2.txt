Before, I will conclude this topic. I would like to talk about some of my bad experience about smoke. The first time I went to America. I have found that 60-70 percents of American are smoke. I think they like to smoke as same as eating food everyday and some of my friend told me that smoking make them relax and calm down. I work in a steak house. I have a lot of friends. One day when we closed the restaurant. We has to mop the floor, clean table, clean grill, stock the products and etc. I know that it was a hard work to close the store and that day the crowd of the customers went to ate in our restaurant. It plus more hard because normally we started closed 10PM but that day, we started to closed at 12. 00 PM. Everyone knew that it was prohibited to smoke in the store but everyone 5-6 employees and 1 manager was smoked but me and my friend hate smoke. This restaurant was like a cigarette factory. It's make me headache. It's ridiculous for me that manager did not obey the rules. You see that we cannot stop people to smoke in restaurant. But it's good to prohibited because not everyone like smoke smell such as me. About to prohibited smoke are more good things than bad things. I know that restaurant have to response to the demand of the customers then restaurant will earn more money but restaurant must care the health of the customer too. This is the ethic of the restaurant. I agree to prohibit.
