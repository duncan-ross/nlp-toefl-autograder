These days, as the zeal for children's education is getting higher, the interest in where to raise their children is increasing, too. However, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in a big city. The city will benefit children with building their goals through diverse experiences and generous attitude toward others by friends from various backgrounds. First of all, children can set more specified dream through plenty of experiences. For example, there are a lot of exhibitions or cultural events held in the city. Due to the excellent transformation system which the city boasts of, they can go to those facilities without any burden. The easier approach to them will help the city's children broaden their knowledge and consequently, children can find their real interests earlier and easier. This is not just good for the children themselves. This also brings positive effect on the country. After the children in the city grow up, they can be socially important person. Second, due to the feature of the city, children can meet friends from diverse backgrounds which can lead the children to develop the flexibility in their social relationships. Originally, cities are made of people from all around the country. There are diverse kinds of person who has different life values and thinking styles. Growing up with them will naturally make the children more generous to the people who have different value and a broad minded person. In conclusion, I highly believe that a big city is better for children to be raised. Not only is it good for the educational aspect, but also it is beneficial for the personal aspect. Therefore, these are the most convincing reasons for my belief.
