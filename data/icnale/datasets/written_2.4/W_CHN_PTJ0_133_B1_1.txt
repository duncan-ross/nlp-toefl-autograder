 My many college students are doing a part-time job. Some of them usually spend one day working outside on the weekends. Others often do this as possible as they have free time. I am also looking for a part-time job. I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. Firstly, we are still studying and we have no career. We ask our parents for money. If we take a part-time job. we will have extra money, which not only reduces our parents' pressure, but also gives us more choices to buy things we want. Secondly, doing a part-time job is a challenge for us, because we are studying in school now and we have not constructed with the society. Doing a part-time job can aboarden our horizon and we will have a better understanding of our future jobs. In addition to this, we can know the rule in the job field ahead. The last point is that doing a part-time job give us a good opportunity to make more friends, which is very important for us to development better. In a conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, doing a part-time job has a lot of benefits: Our abilities are improved and we are becoming denpendent and so on. We only need deal with the relationship between study and the job well.
