It is not rare to see many students are doing part-time jobs when they are in college. Moreover, it seems that more and more students are doing part-time jobs during recent years. I don't support the idea that college students should have part-time jobs. And I have specific reasons for not agreeing with it, which are explained in the following paragraphs. Having free-time jobs is a waste of time. Consequently, college students will have less time to do other things. I can think no better illustration of the idea than the example of my roommate. For instance, my roommate Sun who have six part-time jobs is always exhausted. He doesn't have time to study what he should learn and have no time to exercise. Obviously, it is bad for his schoolwork and his health. Furthermore, he even doesn't have a girlfriend. What a poor boy!There are many people in the world are cheaters. In other words, you probably work day and night and gain nothing. Actually, the situation is not rare, it is just one of many examples I have encountered. For example, my roommate is Liang. He works for a factory for nearly one year. However, the manager of that factory disappears forever. Liang gains nothing. What a gloomy world. From the above, doing part-time jobs may have many disadvantages, so I don't think it is good for college students to have part-time job.
