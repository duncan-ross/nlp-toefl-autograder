It is safe to say that smoking is bad for everybody's health. As we all know, every day a lot of people eating in restaurants. If one person smoking there, others who do not smoke will be affected. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country. To start with, smoking in restaurants is an impolite behavior. It may affect a lot of people who do not like the smelling. In China, there are many smokers. In this case, if the smoking not be banned, a lot of people in restaurants will smoke. So the smelling will be worse and worse. As for me, I hate those people who smoke in the restaurants. In addition, smoking is bad for people's health, especially for those who do not smoke. The second-hand smoke in the restaurant is badly for people's health. The last but not least, smoking in restaurants will destroy the happy environment when we eating. When we eat in a restaurant, we all want to be in a very good environment rather than a bad environment surrounding the smelling of cigarette. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I hope it can be put into practice sooner or later.
