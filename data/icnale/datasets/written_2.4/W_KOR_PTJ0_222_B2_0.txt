These days, it is natural to have a part-time job when teenagers become university students. Almost all of college students do a part-time job after class and even weekends. I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They can learn several things in the course of having their own part-time job. First of all, students will be independent. When teenagers graduate high school and become adults, they need to be out of their parents' protection. They can have self-responsibility through doing a part-time job. Second, college students will realize the value of money. They feel how much it is hard to earn money. So, they will change their spending habits and try to save money. Third, having a part-time job gives college students various social experiences. While students do a part-time job, they get into the society. This will make them think about how hard to survive in a society, how society is operating, and how social network is connected and so on. Although they are still students, they feel what society is through this experience. According to these three reasons, including being independent, realizing the value of money, and getting social experiences, I think having a part-time job when students are in college is critical.
