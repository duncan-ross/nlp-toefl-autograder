I agree with this statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I don't think that they should allow smokers to smoke in their restaurants because it is very bad not only for the smokers but for all the other people in the restaurant as well as including the other customers as well as the restaurant workers. If they continue to allow smoking to take place in the restaurants, it will be hard to ban it later, and they will also have some problems in the meantime while it is still legal. Smokers who want to enjoy a cigarette with their meal should accept that they should have to do so in the confines of their own home where they will not harm anyone else. Next, smokers can do themselves a favor by quitting because not only will their health improve, they will save a lot of some money that they would have otherwise spend on cigarettes. Even the Japan is very different from the United States, I think that these same rules would apply equally well, in the Japanese restaurants would be equally benefited by banning smoking in the restaurants as many U. S. states have already done.
