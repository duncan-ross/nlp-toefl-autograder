Smoking, a heavy topic, which is always accompanied with sad stories. There is a larger and larger group of people ruined by cigarettes day by day. Some little kids lost their grandfathers, even fathers, just for some pieces of cigarettes! What's worse, a smoker may bring larger damage to people around him. So I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places, not only to earn the smoker himself a good body, but also give the cozy atmosphere back to the others. What's more, cigarettes are not cheap, because our country adds the tax percent to cigarettes to keep people away from it. So when smokes in public places, people may have a sense of compete. That is not good to social development. On the other hand, public places should be every citizen's not just some ones. Smoking is so bothering that it may influence people's moods. And it will also do badly to the environment. What's worse, the deserted cigarettes may bring serious effect to soil. And the less of cautious to put off the cigarettes when finished, may be a hidden danger, too. All in all, I think there are lots of benefits to forbid smoking in public places, if we really achieve the goal, we can have a more pleasant atmosphere, do good to public health and reduce hidden danger. We should call on everyone to push forward the course of smoking-forbidden.
