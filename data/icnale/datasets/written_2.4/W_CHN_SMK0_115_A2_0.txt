As we all know that smoking is not allowed in many public places nowadays. Some smokers argue that they have not right to do what they really want to do and they can not stop smoking sometimes in public places. Others say that smoking should certainly banned in public places like restaurants. They have their reasons. In my opinion, I agree with the latter point. Then I will help them to state their reason. First of all, smoking is harmful to smokers' body and people around them will suffer more. Research shows that the second hand smokers suffer 3 times than smokers themselves. So people who don't smoke in the restaurants get affected by the smoke when they sit together with the smokers. Secondly, people always make a bad mood in bad environment. So people around smokers in restaurants will not be in a relax condition and they will not enjoy their meal. What's more, smoke in the restaurants often brings fire accident. We know many incidents happened in restaurants because of smoking. In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should be banned. It seems clear that smoking in restaurants will be bad for smokers themselves and others who don't smoking in restaurants, so these are my reasons.
