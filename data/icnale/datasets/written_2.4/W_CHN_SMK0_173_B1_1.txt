There are many disadvantages to smoking. Smoking has bad effects on our healthy. The one who smoke in public, not only affect himself, but also affect the others around him. However, more and more people join the group of smoking, especially the young people. They are curious to smoking and are attracted to have a try. What's more, some people smoke in anywhere such as restaurants without others' feeling. Face this phenomenon; some people suggest that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. The restaurants should be very comfortable where people can enjoy their dinner and chat with each other. But now in the restaurants we can't be so happily that we want to leave as quickly as possible. Why? Because almost every man is smoking, there is no room for people to breath. The women and children all can't stand completely. Also the guests can not have the sense of which family are eating together at home, they will feel disappointed to the restaurants. And it is very hard for the restaurants to develop in the future. However, some people say that smoking in the restaurants is their right. They can smoke freely. In my view, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. We do anything shouldn't affect others.
