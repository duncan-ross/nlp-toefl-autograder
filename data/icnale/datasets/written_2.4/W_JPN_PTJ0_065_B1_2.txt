I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Unlike high school student, college student must learn and study more voluntarily and hard. Also, they have to learn about real society and go outside. To do so, a part-time job is one of the most reasonable means. In fact, almost all of them think about their future, for example, job, their own family, and death, more seriously. I have spent every day alone since I entered the college, and I'm poorer than the life of hometown. I have a part-time job so that I can live by oneself. As you know when you work, there are a lot of things which we should learn. For instance, we are supposed to learn the way of communicating the others and to have responsibilities than ever and so on. My friend, Takeru, lives alone and makes living by oneself. In spite of this life style, he has very grate record and belongs to tennis club. I respect him so much as my good friend, and also, he gives nice advices that will be surely useful in my future. By reason of these, I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
