Classical economic theory tells us why social ills like smoking should be restricted or banned. Smoking does not simply affect the smoker- it also affects those around him but smokers do not internalize this cost, and as such, society as a whole is paying the price for it in the form of poor public health due to secondhand smoke. The idea is that the effects of secondhand smoke cannot be confined merely to the smoker, but that it knows no boundaries. As such, the rights of the smoker to smoke cannot outweight the rights of the public as a whole. This would be even more pertinent in the context of restaurants as restaurants are meant to be places for quiet and uninterrupted social interaction. Smoking can negatively affect the ambience of a restaurant, damaging the experience for restaurant customers. Given the small area of a restaurant, it is likely that the negative effects of smoke would be exacerbated. However, one counterargument is that it depends on the restaurant. Certain restaurants have different ambiences and the clientele could be the sort that mostly all smoke. In such a case, smoking would be tolerated amongst the clientele, and in some rare cases, even encouraged --- a cigar club, for example. A complete ban is often not to be encouraged and one must look at all the factual circumstances before hastily deciding on a rule. Even in Singapore which has placed a broad ban has made concessions in opening up a certain area in every restaurant for smokers.
