Now a day, The social of the world's have are many change in the social, culture, economic, education and fashion etc. Everything have changing too much and have different of thinking and life's style. The economic is a first trouble of the world. Everybody find to a good ways save money or find to a part-time job for many money. And the University have are life's style for the students. There are many different thinking of yourself. Some students want to only study and practices the skill in the classroom, While some student's do not think that. Because they want to e+A2xperience of your life. They can apply the knowledge in the classroom into the job and the knowledge in the classroom not enough for them. And there are want to some pocket money after them studies finish all day. After that, they doing the homework or report to submit the teacher. Sometime they are tried, but a lot money for them. Finally, I think, if the students have a free-time after study in the University. They can find the pocket money and met many people from a part-time job, because it can make a good experience for you life and abilities of the free-time.
