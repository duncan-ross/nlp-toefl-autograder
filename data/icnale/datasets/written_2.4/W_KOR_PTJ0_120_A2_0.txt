I think part time job is important. First, it makes me to feel importance of saving money. Before I entered the university, I already had experienced part time job. I worked in the factory in 5 days, in a resting place in 3 days and in restaurant in 3 days. I don't remember exactly due to work very shortly. But it was very tired and terrible. Whenever parents gave allowance, I had done anything to do. I bought clothes, ate out and went out to play with my friends. I didn't pay attention to the money before part time jobs did. I really knew how hard it was to earn the money. I thanked for parents after working. It is not bad that earning the tuition for myself. But one of bad points isn't time for me. Second, I felt a lot of things. At the end of each working, I thought that I really study hard. The other word, I really don't want work because part time job is too tired physically. But it makes me feel lots of things. For things that I want to do, study is very important. And I feel that there aren't easy things in the world. The little things need too much effort.
