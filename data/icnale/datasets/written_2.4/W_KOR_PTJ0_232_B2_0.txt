While some people argue that studying is the only duty of college students, I believe having a part-time job is also very important for college students. They need to have a part-time job because it can give them money, experience, and some knowledge of how the economy works. To begin with, they can earn some money by themselves. On average, college students are over 20 years old, which means they are adults, so they have some duty to earn money by themselves in order not to be burdens to their parents anymore. Also, they can feel the importance of money, so they can have habits of saving money and using it wisely. Moreover, through part-time job, they can acquire not only money, but also social experiences. In particular, by doing part-time job, they can learn what good teamwork is. For example, when a college student work at a restaurant as a server, he come to realize some know-how for delivering food well from the cooks to customers, communicating with other servers, and giving accurate information to cashiers. Finally, the college students can learn how the economy works. Through part-time job, they can learn the relationship between employees and employers and they can understand how demand and supply affects the price of the products. Additionally, they can learn some knowledge about the industry he works for. To conclude, it is my belief that doing a part-time job is necessary for the college students because they can learn lessons like how to use money wisely, get social experience, and some knowledge.
