Smoking will give 2nd hand smoke that harms surrounding patrons. This is called negative externality. The "harm" has a few components that makes it really unacceptable to patrons. One component is psychological stress, because the smell of smoke itself may be stressful to patrons who are negative towards smoking and feel choked by the smell. Another component is actual health concerns such as increased risk of diseases such as lung cancer. Other less significant components include the risk of fire and the encouragement of smoking among teens who observe the activity. One aggravating factor is that people tend to stay quite long in restuarants to chit chat, and if a smoker just sits there for a long time and keep puffing away without moving away, the problem is that the 2nd hand smoke gets concentrated in the restuarant unlike in the streets where the wind disperses the smoke so what happens is that the health risks and stress level are MAGNIFIED in a restaurant setting. Another aggravating factor is the population density in a restaurant. Usually, in singapore at least, there are smoking corners for smokers to smoke where they harm only themselves and not innocent bystanders. But in a restuarant not only are there a lot of bystanders but the density of bystanders is a lot higher than in the streets and even the level of bystander in the streets is higher than that of bystanders at a smoking corner.
