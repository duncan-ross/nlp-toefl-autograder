I don't agree this topic. Of course smoking gives people a lot of damage. But I think completely banned is not the best way. For smokers, each restaurant will build a smoking shelter. But I disagree smoking before you put food. Therefore Smokers and nonsmokers should try to understand each other. But what should we do if the bar? I think Nonsmokers should try to understand a little better. One way, nonsmokers can use a bar room. Or use a lot of windows in a well ventilated place. If you put a stop to smoking in pubs the store will be closed. Each restaurant or bar to create a bit of a discipline is also a good way. Today is a democracy. In democracy, even though it's smoking freedom should not be suppressed. However, smokers should be considerate too Secondhand smoke is worse than Smoking. Especially smokers should be don't forget this fact The best thing is to quit smoking. But the most difficult way. Instead, If you obey rules about smoking, no problem. Recklessly ban smoking is unfair. Because people have the right to freedom. Another way is to divide the smoking seat and nonsmoking seat In fact, there are lots of these restaurants. And has been good. For this reason, I prefer that they keep the freedom. Again, so I don't agree on this topic. I think minority opinion is important. Although not a nice person!
