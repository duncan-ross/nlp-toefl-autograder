Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree Because problem of smoking at restaurants in the country is a problem that can not be really solved. Although you know for smoking that is not healthy for yourself and others to use his services, but I still keep pumping each other. Seriously, the law should prohibit smoking in restaurants. In addition, the shop will not legislate itself out. But some customers do not mind the law. It has no legal punishment is strictly prohibited. Whether a new restaurant in Bangkok, all he would know that smoking has negative effect on how both yourself and others But those people never to quit it. Therefore the government should enforce the law and practice seriously. And focus of this problem. Although the restaurant is currently closed signs banning smoking. If the violation fine as 500 or 2000 but still fruitless. The need to enforce good practice seriously and are actually fined Probation or prison for at least six months to follow this strictly. This law shall apply to the restaurant or restaurant anywhere. At least it can help reduce smoking in restaurants can do to improve this problem seriously and to make online restaurant or restaurant food more appetizing and better air fresh air. Therefore, in a restaurant should not be smoking completely. What smoking does not benefit both males smoke and those around him. The solution is the best. Is to instill good values to young people so they can absorb the good and legislation and enforcement seriously is a good way to edit as well. But what we all can do to solve this problem is. This campaign seriously. Including law enforcement and the fact that a clear penalty.
