These days, there are many chances to get a part-time job especially for college students and many of them try to work as part-timers. Even though this maintenance, It is important for college students to have a part-time job still can be argued in terms of losing their own works such as studying, I think having a part-time job is important for college students. There are three reasons to agree with this topic. First, experiencing a part of society can be the best way to know what it is or how it works. It means that they can find a job in the future based on those experiences. Second, having a part-time job is also helpful to establish their economic concept. If the students do not try to do any economic activity, they might just rely on their parents. Making money by themselves can make them think economically. Third, getting into a new world outside of school is very helpful to adjust to real working place after they get graduate. In my conclusion, having a part-time job is important for college students. It can be helpful to find appropriate job, develop economic concept, and know how to adjust outside of school. That's why I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
