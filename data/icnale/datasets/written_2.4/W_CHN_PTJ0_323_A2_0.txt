Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather university students should do part-time jobs. As a present university student, personally, l think university students should do some part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, the university students have had the ability to do some part-time job. They have become strong and skilled. They are not children any more. They are adults. Doing a part-time job not only can improve their skills and health condition, let them understand how hard it is to make money, but also can provide them financial support. What's more, a university student really has a lot of time after class. They have many holidays. Why do not they using the time to do some valuable things? Secondly and importantly, the university students doing a part-time job can reduce their parents' financial pressure. Being a university student, they should start to learn to gain more duty. While, doing a part-time job is a suitable chance to practice them. Thirdly, doing a part-time job can really improve their practical skills and experience and can improve their ability to fight pressure. So this can help them to find a good job in the future. Though the university students do a part-time job is good for them, at the same time they should not leave their study alone. This is very important.
