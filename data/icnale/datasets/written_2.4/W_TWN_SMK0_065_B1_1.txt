I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the restaurants are public places. It should keep air clean. Can you imagine that the restaurant's air is very nasty when you eat? Dirty air would destroy the interest of eating and pollute the environment of earth. So smoking has to be completely banned. Second, second-hand smoke is dangerous. If you have breath in second-hand smoke that would hurt your health. Who wants to eat in the place of second-hand smoke? Who wants to stay an unclean location? No one is willing to accept the terrible place. So smoking has to be completely banned. I know that smoking is personal freedom, but that have to be controlled by self. Just you live earth that you should care about other felling. Because don't smoke people are more than smoker. Therefore, smokers have to respect most people. I have a friend, and she is a smoker. Although I met her for three years, but I never see that she smoke in public place. She just smoke in empty space, like roof, ground, balcony and so on. Smoking is bad for health. But, you really want to smoke. Please, don't smoke in the restaurants, just go out the house.
