Smoking, this kind of activity is pretty known in our society. Not only in private area like home but also in many public places like restaurant, station, etc. Some men cannot do without smoking. The government's plan to ban smoking especially in the restaurant should not be agreed for several reasons. First, even smoking is unhealthy activity but it is very difficult especially for men not to smoke after or before having breakfast, lunch or dinner. Second, based on the new research of world health organization (WHO), at least more than 50% of human population in the world becomes smoker. So ban smoking is not the best planning to do. It seems impossible for the government to stop people from smoking. If government ban smoking in the restaurant, many restaurant's customer will give a lot of complaining or even leave that restaurant. Finally, cigarette industry is one of industries that pervade many workers, so many people will lose their job and the government itself will lose the income from cigarette industry. The conclusion is if government banned smoking in the restaurant, it will affect not only in society but also in economy sector. So I disagree if there is a rule or law which bans smoking in the restaurant.
