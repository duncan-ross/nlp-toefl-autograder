Our society has many smokers. So today recognition about smoking was as much higher than the past. For example, the police are recently cracking down a smoker in non-smoking areas in Seoul. Most of smokers are easy to feel cumbersome what obey the law. For this reason actually cause stress for the smoker but it can't be helped for their health. I don't smoke but I don't think that smokers are being a bad man. I think that smoking is means to relieve stress for smoker. But smoking can causes harm to someone else. That is typical example is secondhand smoking. Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. For this reason, I'm sorry for smokers but I hope to keep smokers and passive smokers' body in good condition. But you don't push the smokers too much stop smoking. It may produce a negative effect to smokers. The best way is to motivate smokers to stop smoking. Then they will stop smoking themselves easily. I've had a similar experience, too. When I forced to stop smoking, my father who was smoker thought nitpicking. But when I encouraged my father to stop smoking, he showed a favorable attitude to me. In other words, smokers need motivation which stops smoking and encouragement.
