China is becoming a country which has many college students and the school fee is rising sharply. So nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. On this phenomenon, I just have my own opinion. Though to have after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, part-time jobs often distract students' attention from their studies, so some students have shown a decline in their studies, and some even play truant. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our society. But On the other hand, it helps to build independence in young people and make them more mature, and students who have part-time jobs can relieve the economic burdens of their parents. Most college students have been spoiled by their parents, and even their grandparents. So some of them can do nothing and can't sustain the pressures and stress. To have a part time job can help those students to adapt to society more easily, learning how to communicate with others and how to protect themselves. Some students who have part-time jobs may relieve their parents' economic burdens. The most important is that, to have a part time job can gain skill points. A graduate who only have high scores but no experience is not a real talent so that I just agree the topic about whether it's important for college students to have a part time job.
