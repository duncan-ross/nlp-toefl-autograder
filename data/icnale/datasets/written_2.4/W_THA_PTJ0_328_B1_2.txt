Nowadays, the world has changed. The college students not only the college students in West but also in East are going to have a part-time jobs when they have free time. I think It is important for college students to have a part-time job because they have to live themselves after they moved from their parents' house so they must earn money themselves. There are many reasons for college students to have a part-time job. For example, they can purchase things they like, they may help their parents to decrease their expenses, they will realize on the wealth of money, they can spend time doing the right thing instead of playing computer games, surfing the net, or playing facebook. Doing the part-time job isn't a waste of time because they will get many new experiences for their daily life, they may make friends from their part-time job and may be they will meet their boyfriend or girlfriend, and they will make their parents proud to themselves that they can help themselves and may be these college students will grow into a good and responsible adult. As we've known that doing the part-time job has many benefits so it is better to persuade the teenagers who are studying in college or university to do this.
