What does part time job means to you? While to me, it means earning extra cash on top of my daily allowance from parents, to support my heavy shopping habits. I believed to most Singapore teenager age ranging from 15 to 19 years old, it means the same to them. However, on the minority side, some who are less fortunate than most of us actually see it as an important part of their life. To them, it means daily meals, school fees, and basic necessities, which may not seem to be a problem in our life nor does it even, came across our mind not until I experienced/ see it myself. 2 years ago, I had the chance to meet and interact with people that took up several part time jobs a day to make meet ends through my voluntary work. I took quite sometimes to actually believe what I had seen and heard from them, I always thought that such scenario only appear on television/dramas (this is how ignorant I am in the past) but they do exist in a small corner of Singapore, ignored and forgotten by us. There is actually a deep meaning behind part time job that we had over see. Thus, such experiences make me appreciate more the money I earned from my part time jobs.
