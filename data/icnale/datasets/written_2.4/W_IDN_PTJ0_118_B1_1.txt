Well, I think it is important for college student to have a part time job because there are some advantages to do it. First, we can get the experience from having a part time job. For example if we're a private luther as what I'm doing right now and fortunately, I teach an elementary student in the first grade. I think it is so funny to teach her. And she has a young sister that always join with us if we start to study. Sometimes, her young sister always making annoyance between us until they get fighting, pinch and beat each other, and finally they cry together. I was so confuse at that time. I tried to make them calm down but it is not working until their mother come to the room and take the young sister out. I can get a new experience when I teach her and I realize that it is not easy to get a money. The second reason is, we can help our family financial. Usually if we want to buy something, we always asking for the money to our parents. If we have a part time job, we can buy anything we want and save the money for the next time for another thing. And the last reason is, we can be an independent person. With having a part time job, we can devide our time, which one we have to do first between study in college or work as a side job. We can manage our time and make the priority. Overall, maybe we can try to have a part time because of the reasons above. According to me, it is so funny and challenging for us. And we can spend our spare time with something good.
