Some people suggested that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. One of the reasons is earning money. It does not mean that we have to find a high salary part-time job which enough to support our daily life. The salary of the part-time job is not the main reason although it is good that we have a high salary part-time job. The most important thing of earning money is to understand how difficult of earning money and spend our money appropriately. Because there are many people misuse their money like overloading the credit card to buy some unnecessary items, especially university students. Thus, they think that it is important for university students to learn how to earn money. However, some people argued that it is not important for university students to have a part-time job. The reason is there will be too much workload for university students. Not only have assignments and concepts, but also the examinations which are very difficult. They are afraid students may not have enough energy and time to handle part-time job which is quite heavy. If they cannot handle the workloads, the academic result may be dropped. Therefore, they suggest university students should concentrate on their own university life. In my opinion, I agree it is important for university students to have a part-time job. In addition to the reason mentioned before, earning more experience is most important. Not only gaining experience from the job steps, but also we can learn how to work with others who has different background and mind during the real world process. It is important to university students to achieve.
