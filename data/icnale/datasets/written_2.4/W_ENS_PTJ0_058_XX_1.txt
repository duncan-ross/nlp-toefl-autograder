Students to work part-time are doing a great thing for themselves. By working part-time, they can make a little bit of money and still attend classes at the same time. Part-time work should not be so intense that students cannot focus on their studies, and I think that many establishments in college towns are aware of this idea. As a result, it is only the students fault if they take on more works than they can handle. Next, having a part-time job teaches us how to be more responsible and how to work in general. I am always surprised when a new freshman comes to work at our restaurant and has no idea how to work. I wonder if I was ever really like that, but I know I was at one point. The students who have no work experience often learn the fastest and often gain the most from the time they spend at our restaurant, so I think that overall part-time work is a great addition to any student's curriculum. Finally, we have the chance to make many new friends and meet a wide variety of people that we would never have if we were not working part-time.
