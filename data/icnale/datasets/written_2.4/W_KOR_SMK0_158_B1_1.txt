I am the smoker. Therefore, recently I was many worried about the implemented antismoking policy stops. For example, as to the nonsmoking section and no smoking building setting, there is no consideration about the smoker. This gives the inconvenience to the smokers. Of course, the cigarette smoke gives the very bad effect to the nonsmokers. However, the smokers moreover, it smokes with the maximum manner. If the place where it is designated is prepared, it can smoke in that place. Therefore, the preparation about the severe smoking or the nonsmoking section setting has to be once again thought. The equal rights are included to the smokers. Therefore, the right of the non-smoker and smoker has to be equally thought. And the consideration which moreover there are lots of the non-smokers has to be given. The smoking is one part among the freedom of the people. In the country, the consideration about the smoker has to be given. If not, in the dimension of state, the smoking is not produced. In this way, if it becomes, if the country classifies the smoking into the narcotic and illegally the smoking is made, it will be of service to the country profit. It will have a good effect that it is good in the people's health.
