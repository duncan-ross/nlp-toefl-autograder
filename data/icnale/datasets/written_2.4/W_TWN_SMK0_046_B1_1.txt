I think it is good for much people. My major is nursing, so always learn that smoking's bad point, and smoking is unhealthy for not only smoker but also people who near the smoker. When I was a child, I just don't like the smell, but when I grow up I learn about smoking's bad point, I really hope my father can give up this hobbit. Sometimes really have to use the rule to ban smoking at all restaurant, because advises are not effective for each smoker, so I am happy that have this rule. Maybe everyone has self's relax way, but I think mustn't effect other people, so I think this rule is reasonable and I also support this rule. B hepatitis is prevails over the Taiwan in my parent's age, if get a B hepatitis, smoking will deteriorate your health very much, smoking also have many bad point for we, smoker's respiratory tract will be sick and smoking will take we much money for buy tobacco leaf and go to see a doctor, some people just want to get happy by smoking, they don't know that will bring something bad in the future, so by this rule, people will be more attach importance to smoking, I think it's good for us. Hope someday this rule can do well in each place,
