 In my point of view, part-time job is a necessity for college students. It is estimated that 30% of the college students have done a part-time job. It will bring us quite a few benefits. First of all, earning money is the primary aim of most people. It can release the financial burden of our parents and even make our college life more comfortable. Secondly, the experience it gives us is quite valuable and precious. Once you have experienced the bitterness that few people have, you would have more understandings of life, study, and what we want to achieve. Surly we will be strong enough to face the challenges. We all know that one day we will inevitably step into society and find a suitable job for ourselves. But, how to cooperate with the colleagues? How to work better? How to get along well with the employer? There are many rules and principles that we can't get in class. And if we learn them now, we will have advantages. Of course, we had better look for a part-time job in spare time, but only on condition that we have managed our courses. The grade should be our top concern. In a word, there are a lot of benefits of doing a part-time job, and we are supposed to arrange learning and doing jobs correctly.
