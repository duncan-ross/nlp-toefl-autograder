It is a new trend that smoke should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I reckon the idea of no smoking in any restaurant a great one. As we know, there has been so many non-government organizations working hard, trying to tell people the damage caused by smoking. Smokers are addicted, and those people who smoke can have serious lung problems or any related diseases. These health problems may not only kill a person, but also ruin a whole family as there have been countless people and families suffering from those disasters. What's more, it is not just the people who smoke can be harmed physically by the cigarette. Those who don't smoke, non-smokers, may also have lung problems just because they breathe in the smoke exhausted by the smokers near by. As smoking can hurt people in both physical and mental ways, it should be banned in public areas, such as restaurants, around the country. Even if there is merely one person smoking, the damage may hurt everyone in the area. In a modern society, people have rights to decide what they want and the rights to say no. That is, we can't protect the non-smokers or guarantee them that no harms will be done when we are living in an environment where others are smoking; therefore, banning this harmful behavior is absolutely the right thing to do.
