 There is an ongoing debate concerning around the issue as whether it is important for college students to have a part-time post. As a newcomer in college, I think that working out during vocation is an admirable experience for us, for the following two reasons. First of foremost, students in university have a great amount of spare time, some students will drop themselves into internet bar to spend their time after study. Of course, it is insignificant to waste our valuable time in this way. So, though work, we can be prevented from addicting to computer games and we won't feel boring in spare time. Secondly, for the young generation like us, doing part-time job means we can get working experience and reward. We can slowly become financial independent and ask less money from parents. We should know that time in university is so short; every one of us will finally get in society. It is obviously that we are laying foundation for our future through working part-timely. Nevertheless, part-time isn't always perfect. We must admit that as a young adult, we are easy to be cheated. So it is commonly reported by newspaper that university students were cheated when working out. There is still some risk exists. So, we should learn to protect ourselves when working out of school. It is also a skill we can't learn in our textbooks. On balance, I tend to believe it is significant for college student to do part-time job.
