Restrictions on the time, place and manner in which public smoking may occur have been increasing over the last several years. While the early focus of anti-smoking initiatives was on consumer education and industry advertising restrictions, over the past two decades, smoking opponents have increasingly taken their battle to state and local governments, seeking prohibitions on smoking in a wide variety of public establishments. Advocates of these bans claim to be protecting the nonsmoking public and workers from the adverse health effects of secondhand smoke. Opponents of smoking restrictions dispute the existence and/or severity of these adverse consequences and claim that bans have the unintended consequence of hurting business. Nationwide, the number of local communities implementing full or partial bans on smoking in public facilities – including worksites, bars and restaurants – has increased more than eight-fold over the past two years. Of course, there will always be holes or vagueness in passing bills and making rules. It is uncertain whether the bill would allow smoking on open-air decks and patios, and it's not clear whether anyone could light up on an outdoor deck that was screened in the summer and heated in the winter. To allow to have smoking or not, so, it can depends on many reasons and factors. If there will be smoking in the restaurants, the owners should establish the regulations and do something that smoking cannot harm the innocent customers.
