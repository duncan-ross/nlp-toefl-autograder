Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the sake of everyone's health. Restaurants are for eating not for smoking. Most of non-smoker people don't like the smell of the cigarettes. I heard from the television that it is more dangerous if you inhale the smoke from the cigarette than smoking the cigarette. Restaurant is a public place where many people come and go to eat and to respect them, smokers should not smoke inside the restaurant, in the bathroom of the restaurant and near the door or exit place of the restaurant because we don't know if there is a person who have a disease in the lungs or if it's not good for them to smell cigarette smoke. If smokers still continue to smoke in public, people who do not smoke will suffer from fume and smell. Another thing, there are a lot of children in public places and restaurants. It is not good for them if they see an adult smoking because they can learn from it and they will imitate and try to smoke too even at their young age. Most especially, smoking is very bad for the health of a person. Even we live in a democratic country, where it is free to do anything you like, we must remeber that we need to respect other people in our surroundings. We, non-smokers doesn't disturb or prohibit your individual freedom and selection. In exchange of that, you should also respect people who don't smoke and don't like the smell of the cigarettes.
