Although I want to have a part-time job my mom will not let me because she thinks it will interfere with my studying. Many of my friends are lucky enough to have parents that let them do basically what they want to do in college as long as they have good grades. I have good grades, but this does not seem to be good enough for my mom. I tell her that I am doing fine and I have plenty of time, and I would love to make a little bit of money so that I could go out with my friends if I wanted to, but she simply won't hear it. Because of this, I think it is even more important for college students to have a part-time job. If they are doing well in school and they are doing well as people, there is no reason they shouldn't have a part-time job if they want to. It can also really help when you are looking for a real job after you graduate, and I hope that one day soon my mom will think it is OK for me to have a part-time job so that I can gain some of this experience that will help me after I graduate too.
