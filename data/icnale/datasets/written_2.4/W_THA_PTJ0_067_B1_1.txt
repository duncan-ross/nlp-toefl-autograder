I agree because the students at the university level are responsible enough. They can help families. They may help alleviate the expenses of studying by having the part-time work. When there are available time existing, most students are often interested to hang out with their companies, but some of students may attend to have a part-time work. If they take time, try to find a part-time job, they can make money as an expense and a scholarship for themselves. It will benefit many more things for their lives. I will also make more money from a part-time work after realizing about the value of money and it has not paid lavishly. However, working part time should be done after classes. It shouldn't be done while having classes. If so the study result may be unsatisfied. The part-time work should be made whenever you are ready in available time. Also, it should be in a short time. You should share the good time when having a part-time job. For both school and working part-time the university students have to consider what is most important to us at this time is intended to review the lessons and learning all the time when there is free time. For a better life in the future. So proud of ourselves and families to have a part time job and graduate in a good grade.
