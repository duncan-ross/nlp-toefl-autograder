I don't think it should be banned legally by the government. I believe that it's a personal choice of the restaurant proprietor and his prospective client. Many restaurants have already gone non-smoking in other parts of the world, but in Japan, there are still a lot more smoking than non-smoking. I don't smoke myself, but I don't begrudge others if they want to. If you use force, by legal compliance or otherwise, the Japanese Government would be taking away a person's or restaurant's choice and then what are they left with? Perhaps 0. 01% less instances of cancer or related diseases. Kowtowing to the minority who happen to be either allergic to or who just resent smoking and smokers, is clearly not the answer. Otherwise, come election time in Japan, the government might discover that there are more smoking voters than non-smoking voters which, is highly probable. You would stand more of chance trying to ban the rain than ban smoking across restaurants in Japan. Instead of trying to force and enforce a ban, I think that the Japanese Government would be better off testing the waters first. E. g. they might consider polling the people first before trying to force them into doing things. Seems to me that it would be the diplomatic and tactful way of finding out what's what and who stands where on the issue.
