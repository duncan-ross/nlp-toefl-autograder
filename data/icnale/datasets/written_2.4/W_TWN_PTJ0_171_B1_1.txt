I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Before my first part-time job, I thought that part-time jobs do not play so critical roles in my college life. I supposed that students should concentrate on their study, so a part-time job would make me lose focus on the study. Besides, I heard plenty of examples about how part-time jobs make students abundant their study. Therefore, I had considered that a part-time job is not so important for college students. Now, however, I absolutely changed this expression, after having my part-time job, because I obtained a lot of things from it, not only money, but also some practical experiences, such as how to communicate with customers or other people, how to introduce products and other work skill which I can't learn in college class. Otherwise, by my part-time job I also found what I was lack of, so I could know how to improve myself, and realized what I'm really interested in, by which I know what kind of job I should find in the future. Doing a real work is one thing and talking a work in class is totally other thing. A part-time job could let college students understand the real situation of work, find their lack in work, and learn new skill and experiences, so they would know how they could do for the future. Therefore, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
