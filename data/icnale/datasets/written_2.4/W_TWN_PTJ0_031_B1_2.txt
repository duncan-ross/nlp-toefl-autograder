Of course I have been asked several times whether students should take part time job, and my answer is definitely positive. Though many parents may think that study hard is the only and the most important responsibility for college students. And they may also consider earning so less money by spending so much time on it is worthless. However, taking part time job during university period is more than just earning money. Studying in university is a crucial period because students must learn professional knowledge and social ability to survive in the future society. Students can learn the subjects that they are interested in on major, but I do not think students can experience how people interact in the real and cruel society. Taking part time job provide the chance for student to feel reality. Furthermore, College students are already grown up, it is the right time for them to manage their own money. Parents can not always accompany their children and give them financial support, so students need to make their own money, find out how to use it properly, and try to treat back to their parents. The purpose of taking part time job is surly not about the money, the most vital goal is to be prepared and to make future life better.
