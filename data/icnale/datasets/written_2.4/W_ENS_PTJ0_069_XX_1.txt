I think that is probably important for college students to have a part-time job in college because everyone is always talking about this issue, and my parents have always strongly encouraged me to get a part-time job. I have only just entered college, and I think I would like to take a semester or two to get accustomed to the college environment before I tried to do too many things at once. If I feel that I'm able to deal with both classes and work in a manner which is acceptable to me, I will definitely pursue part time work, and at that time, my opinion will probably be that college students should always without a doubt have a part-time job. However, if I find that I do not have enough time, I will probably begin to think that it is not so important for college students to have a job. It really comes down to how well you can balance both activities, and this will vary based upon individuals. What might be too much work for me is probably a comfortable amount of work for someone else, and so our decisions would differ based on that. I think it is great that everyone can tailor their college experience to suit their own level of comfort.
