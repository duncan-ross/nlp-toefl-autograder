For me it is important to college students to have a part time job. They could apply and practice all the things they have learned from school. They will also learn many things that are really necessary to know about business world. There are also things that are not thought in school that students will discover while working. If the job is in the student's field it is more beneficial. Having experiences with what you have studied in school will have great addition to your resume. How to interact properly to people you meet every day is also an advantage in having a part time job. Students can meet professional people that you could use as connections to help you get a job after they graduated. They will also have experiences that would help them improve their skills specially the technical and speaking skills. Students having part time job while studying can demonstrate that he or she can balance difficult priorities. This will show how responsible, organize and efficient he or she is and how they can manage their time. Financially, it could also support them and will teach them how to handle and spend money properly. They could also help financially to their family.
