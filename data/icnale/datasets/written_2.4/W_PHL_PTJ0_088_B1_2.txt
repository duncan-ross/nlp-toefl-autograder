This generation part time jobs among college students are increasing. As what I have observed in fast foods such as Mcdonalds, I noticed that many are young, young as college students. There are also known as working students. As I can see, it is hard for them, they are studying and at the same time there working. College students who are working in part time jobs are increasing. It just shows that at a young age many are now working even though it is just a part time job. In my opinion that does not seem right, but still there is a part of it that I like, at a young age students can already experience how to work, but the negative thing is, they somewhat cannot enjoy their youth. In reality it's alright to wok if they are already in the right age. I have encountered people who are working students. When they shared their experiences, I was stunned and amaze, that is why I admire them. Working while studying? That is hard. I believe that part time jobs are also good. It can help people to be stronger. How? Just by getting along with other people, studying while they are working, I can say that you can be stronger just by that, especially the college students.
