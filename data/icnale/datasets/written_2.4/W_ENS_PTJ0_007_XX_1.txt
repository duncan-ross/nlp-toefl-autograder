I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. What many students don't realize is that because the economy is so bad right now, good grades and academic achievement are not enough to ensure employment after graduation, especially in technical fields like engineering or physiology. The fact of the matter is the standards for college graduates have been rising for some time, in one result of this is that students must accomplish more in the same amount of time as they would have had to in the past. I also think that part-time jobs can have a positive influence on college students' learning experience. For example, paid and unpaid internships give students the opportunity to acquire real industry experience while solidifying the knowledge that they will gain in their classes. I've held internships in both of my summers here at university, and I think that I am a much stronger job candidate than my classmates who do not have such experience. Furthermore, I had earned enough money just in the summers as an intern so that I would not have to work during the regular semester. In this way, I was able to both further my career prospects while retaining focus on my studies.
