Nowadays, some university students have a part time job outside the school. However some students don't agree with their behavior. They think this may damage to their course and they may even fail to their examination. They can't balance the course and job. In my opinion, it is important for us to do part time jobs. First of all, it is important for us to have as many useful part time jobs as possible to prepare for career changes after graduated from school. It is very common for us to do a part time job before finding a job that is suitable for us. A student of English language and lecture, for example, may finally settle down in a car company working as a marketing assistant. This results from his or her experience in doing part time jobs. Also, students need to take a wide range of work experience so that we can make ourselves accustom to the job. Our purpose of learning is to find a job. After four years later, every one of us should go to work. In such cases, some experience of job should be highly recommended. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during university is important. This will make you more employable and develop practical shills outside the classroom.
