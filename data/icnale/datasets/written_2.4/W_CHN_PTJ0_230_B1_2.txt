 People used to regard the main target of students was to study, while this notion has changed greatly that part-time job can bring benefits in many aspects. So nowadays an increasing number of students are taking up part-time jobs. Seen from my own experience, the advantages of part-time jobs can be concluded into two main aspects. First, the experience of a part-time job can be of great help when you start you career as you have already acquired the skill to handle the emergency independently. And you can get in the society earlier than your peers and learn how to deal with the interpersonal relationship. When you offer an application, the working experience can be your bright points. Second, the reward of a part-time job may not be so high but it is undoubtedly your first pot of gold, which is of great meaning throughout you life. The feeling of spending money earned by yourself differs a lot from spending the pocket money given by parents. It gives you a sense of pride that all that you have done has been acknowledged and appreciated, and it can also silently teach you how to treasure every penny. So, it's not surprising to see he rising percentage of part-time job takers in the campus. To everyone, it is an irreplaceable experience which brings nothing but benefits.
