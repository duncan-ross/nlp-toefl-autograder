 As the developing of the society and the increasing of the number of the high school students, more and more high school students begin to take a part time job. Many people think students shouldn't take part time job. But in my opinion, part time job is necessary. There are many high school students whose families are below the poverty line. Their parents can't pay their school fee. If they don't take part time job, they can't go to college. So part time job is necessary for them. Not only money can part time job provide, but also can provide much experience which we can't learn in classroom. Now in our society, many college students can only study. They even don't know how to live. Part time job is right for them to get the experience to live and to work. Taking part time job can also let us know how hard that our parents bring up us. And let us more respect our parents. Taking part time job can lighten our parents' burden, can provide us with much experience and also can let us more respect our parents. So I think part time job is necessary.
