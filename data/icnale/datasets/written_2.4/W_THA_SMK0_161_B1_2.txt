Nowadays there are addicted to smoking cigarettes. There are many smokers and non-smokers in the country. From being treated different publicly to being looked at differently in terms of health, both smokers and non-smokers have their own opinion. Just as smokers attend social events so do non-smokers. A few examples of the social events attended are: bars, clubs, concerts, restaurants, bowling alleys, etc. Smoking is allowed at most of these events. Whether or not you are a smoker, you will endure a cloud of smoke or come home with the faint scent of smoke on your clothes at one time or another. Then what should we do? Why don't you imagine you and your family are at a nice restaurant, waiting to enjoy a great meal, or so you think? As you lean in to take that first bite, a cloud of smoke surrounds you, your family, and your food. A big topic being brought to attention these days is whether or not smoking should be banned from all restaurants. Smoking in public areas should be taken into close consideration. There are many reasons of why this is brought to attention. These include the harmful effects it can have on all people, smokers and non-smokers, as well as the environment, which most people would not consider. There should be rules enforced for smoking in public places. Smokers just do not know the negative influence they are spreading. I am not a smoker, and I cannot stand having the stench of smoke on my clothes. The smell of smoke is not harmful, for a smoker to be allowed to smoke in public is a crime. That might be a good idea but I can't do anything about it.
