There are advantages and disadvantages about the issue whether to get a part-time job or not for college students. Personally speaking, I think it is a good chance to build teenagers' ability to be independent in economy from their parents and those who get a part-time job were offered a stage to see the differences between school life and adult life. It is also a test for them to find out the answer to these two questions: Were what I have learned provide myself enough skills to be stand out in the crowd? Am I really enjoy the classes that I majoring in college? After all, the experiences of life are what you really can learn. I think sometimes the things you can acquire in a part-time job are far more than words in the textbook or wisdom words that come out from the famous teacher but you can not get the true meanings in it because you are too young to know it. But being a student, you split time and energy involving in a job would cause certainly affects on your studies or relationships. Some parents think students should do and behave just like a student. They acclaim that teenagers in college---their only responsibilities are to study well and enjoy school life which is precious and could only being able to experience once. Some students want to invest themselves with as much knowledge as the can reach in college. Then, someday, these knowledge will make them special or have more advantages than others. To sum up, to get a part-time job or not, it depends, I think. Different reasons or backgrounds can decide a college student's will or thought about this question. To me, I will say YES for I want to explore more outside the school!
