It is necessary for college student to have part-time job. First, through the experience of part-time job, they can find their aptitude for their future career. Let's suppose there is a college student who is interested in running restaurant. If she works in a restaurant or a firm as a part-timer and has a chance to see the real business situation very closely, she can reflect it to her process of job decision more easily. Second, doing a part-time job can help college student developing social skills such as communication strategy, making good relationship with strangers, and teamwork. Although a student works for a trivial part comparing to the entire process in her part-time job, such as photocopying, cleaning, or typing, she should have a sense of responsibility and cannot help communicating with other people. Third, doing part-time job leads college students to be independent economically from their family. Considering the fact that they are adults and member of the society, they need to be independent from the parents care. In the light of this, as a first step for being a real adult, money-making is needed for the students. For this three reasons, it is very good chance for college students to have part-time job.
