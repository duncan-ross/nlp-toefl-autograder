I don't agree if the college students have a part time job. Because I think if we decide to study, we have to be focus to the lesson. We learn to get the knowledge, and we can use the knowledge have we gotten during the study to get a job in the future. A part time job can disturb our study, because we will not focus with the lesson. We difficult to divide time between study and work. Every day, the students have a part time job spent a lot of time to work and study. So, they have short time to take a rest. Moreover they forget to eat. That makes disturb their healthy. Some of students have a part time job, seldom to do the duty or forget assignments. Because they are busy with their job, and almost have not time to do the duty. Usually they are sleepy in the class, because less of rest, and they also often absent in class. Life is a choice, we have to choose one of the priority which has to do first, I think study is more important to do first. Because we will get a job if we have the knowledge. So, without regretting in the future.
