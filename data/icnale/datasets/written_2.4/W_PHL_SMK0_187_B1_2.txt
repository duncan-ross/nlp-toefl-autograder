As we all know, smoking is dangerous to every individual's health. It will have bad effects to the smokers like cancer and infections to your body; and not only to the smokers but also to the person who inhales the smoke coming out from the cigarettes. Most of the people said that if you start smoking at an early stage, it will be harder for that person to stop smoking immediately. It is kind of addiction that you will look for everyday. So if a person do not like to be addicted to cigarettes, it is better not to try it at all. Some of the reasons why they use cigarettes are people thinks it is cool or maybe they where influenced by their friends and the people they see. However, some people can't really stop smoking. They smoke every time and everywhere they want like in parks, beside the school or universities, mall, market, restaurants and to places where people love to stay. In places like restaurants, smoking must be banned there. Why? Because people should consider that in restaurant is a place where we eat or sometimes where we chill or relax. It should have a smooth, fresh and clean atmosphere.
