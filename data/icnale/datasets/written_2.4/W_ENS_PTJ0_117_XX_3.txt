In my opinion, it is very important for students to have a part-time job. University should not just be about book-learning, it should be used as an opportunity to expand horizons and gain real world experience. A part-time job is the perfect opportunity for this. A part-time job teaches responsibility as students have to learn to be punctual and to follow their bosses instructions. A part-time job acts as a great bridge between the'safe and comforting' environment of university and the'harsh reality' of the workplace. Without the experience of a part-time job in university, students who enter the workplace are likely to find it much more difficult to adjust to the very different demands expected of them at work. A part-time job is also a great way to gain independence. With the money from a part-time job, students no longer have to rely on'handouts' from their parents or others. Instead they can become independent and more prepared for the challenges of life beyond university. However, above all, a part-time job looks great on a resume, which is very important in an increasingly competitive job market. A part-time job is a great edge over other students who do not have this experience. It immediately demonstrates to a potential employer that the job candidate is responsible and a hard worker and will be more prepared than most for life at the company. So a part-time job at university is not just a way to make a bit of extra pocket money, but a way to secure a great career and a great future. This is an opportunity which should not be passed up.
