Smoking is bad in all forms – anytime and anywhere. Smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in our country because of multiple reasons. First, because smoke (from cigarettes or anything of that kind) is very dirty and dirt does not really come together with food. Imagine eating the ashes from the cigarettes together with pasta soup, or steak. It's disgusting. Next, smoking should be banned in all restaurants for hygienic purposes. The food we eat should be kept clean – if not a hundred percent, at least as clean as possible. Smoking in restaurants could make other non-smoking customers/guests inhale their second hand smoke which is far more dangerous than smoking itself. Other guests might also be allergic to smoke or dust and sitting next to these smokers could probably cause them to have an asthma attack and end up lying on a hospital bed wearing a ridiculous looking gown. Lastly, food should be consumed at its very best, warm from the restaurant kitchen without air pollutants (smoke from cigarettes), served by a waiter not squinting his/her eyes and wrinkling his/her nose from the scent of another customer smoking/burning their lungs out and slowly developing lung cancer. Food is grace from God, it should be respected and given the utmost importance.
