Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I am agree with this statement. In Indonesia there are restaurants everywhere they and I notice many customers smoke while they are in the restaurant. Restaurants becomes with place of choice for people to let go of hunger as well as a place to relax after so many hours through rush. Restaurant becomes a place that is convenient for consumer. Leisure can be supported from the cleanliness. Besides, in the restaurant is also not allowed to smoke. Lot of restaurants that visitors will not be comfortable with smoke. Comfortable atmosphere will disappear with the smoke from cigarettes. As recommended by the government, smoking can also damage health. Smoking is dangerous because it can cause serious diseases, for example hypertension, lung cancer, etc. If you want to smoke can be created for a special room where space only serve targeted specifically for people who smoke only. That way will not interfere with consumer convenience in the restaurant. The longer the space created specifically for the smoking, then smokers will decrease over time, so the advice not smoke can be carried out in total. This is because the consciousness of people not smoke has increased.
