I agree with this statement to a large extent. Nowadays most, if not all restaurants are air-conditioned. If smoking is allowed inside then the whole restaurant will smell and those people who do not smoke will suffer. Smoking is bad for health; even the government has anti-smoking campaigns set up and help hotlines to aid people who want to quit smoking. It is said that non-smokers who breathe in second-hand smoke have a higher chance of getting cancer compared to smokers themselves. Since smoking and breathing in the smoke is so unhealthy, the government must do whatever it can to help those who do not smoke and also try to reduce the number of people lighting up cigarettes. Restaurants should completely ban smoking so as to inconvenience the smokers whenever they feel like puffing and they have to finish their food then go outside for a puff. If they are allowed to smoke inside the restaurant, it will be so convenient for them and the smokers will not think twice about lighting up a cigarette. They will stay longer in the restaurant and some may smoke more than one cigarette during the meal. Non-smokers will have to bear with the smoke and end up with having the smell on their clothes and hair which may be irritating to some.
