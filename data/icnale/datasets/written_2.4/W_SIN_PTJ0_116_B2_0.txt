Part-time jobs are invaluable in helping college students know what it is that they want to do later in life. In our current education system in Singapore, students just take the same subjects even if they don't really like it because that is the way it works to get to the university or Polytechnic. So the problem is that they are likely to get lost when choosing a course, and even after choosing a course to study, they are unlikely to be passionate about their future career because they have no idea what it is like to work in the industry unless they have taken internships or part-time jobs. That said, part-time jobs can be done during term time but few internships really can be done in term time. Part-time jobs taken during term time complements internships done during holidays to give students a good look at how the working world runs and what they really want to do later on after they graduate. Another use of part-time jobs is to learn skills. Some relevant skills are like time management and job-specfic understanding and hands-on administrative skill. These skills are actually what makes a person fit in well at work after he graduates from college. This leads people with part-time work experience to feel more confident going to work in the industry and even helps in clearing interviews as the person is able to demonstrate that he or she has what it takes to succeed besides just academic knowledge.
