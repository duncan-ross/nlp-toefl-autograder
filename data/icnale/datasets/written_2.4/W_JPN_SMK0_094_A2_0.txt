I agree with the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. Firstly, there are many people who dislike breathing the smoke. And they don't want breath the fog at all. But if there are people smokes in the restaurant, even if the seats are separate, it cannot completely remove the smoke. So, nonsmoking people are forced to breathe the smoke more or less. Many people may come to restaurant to enjoy having their dishes. At such a place, smoke is nothing but their harm. It may break taste or smell of good dishes. And may your cloth will absorb the odor. Another reason for Agree with the statement is there are many children in Japanese restaurant. Cigarette's smoke contains many harmful chemicals, And especially it tend to suffer not smoking people but surround people. If restaurant permit smoking in the restaurant, children in there might breathe smokes. Cigarette's smoke can be poison for children. Actually cigarette's package is warning Pregnant don't smoke. Depend on these reason, I think we should be completely banned smoking at all the restaurant. And if smoker think children and surround people, they should keep off smoking such a place.
