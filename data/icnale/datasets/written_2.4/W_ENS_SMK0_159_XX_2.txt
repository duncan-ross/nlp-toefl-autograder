I say. If the truth be known, I think that this getting to be a rather tiresome point for debate and discussion and it is a moot point in my eyes. Science and statistics all around the globe have already unequivocally proven, beyond any reasonable doubt that smoking causes death, disease, heart failure, stroke and the list goes on. So, why do people still feel the need to cater for what was once a majority group but is becoming more and more the minority group that call themselves smokers. Quite frankly, it's ridiculous because it has already been established and proven beyond any shadow of a doubt, that thousands upon thousands of smokers and passive smokers will die preventable deaths or succumb to preventable, smoking attributed diseases, every single year and the numbers are continually rising. I think that the time for this debate and discussion has well and truly passed its usefulness. Don't you? Japan should have no hesitation in drafting legislation that prohibits smoking in restaurants and each and every public facility across Japan, to take effect immediately. The Japanese Government should also brook no argument from any quarter, because there can be no more arguments, only effective action.
