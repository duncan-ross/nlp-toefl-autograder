I disagree I'm afraid. I believe that now, academic workloads are fairly hefty and the pressure to do exceptionally well is extremely high. Students are not just wanting to graduate now a large portion of students are all striving to graduate within the top ten of their respective courses. Students are not stupid and they know what is going on in the world and understand that it is not enough to just graduate or just pass exams, if they really want to achieve something in their careers, then they need to excel. To do that, they must devote as much of their time to study as they possibly can which doesn't leave a lot of time for work or play. I have seen a few exceptional students who have graduated at the top of their course and held a job simultaneously, but these were in the minority. The big recruiting companies in Australia are very choosy these days. For one thing, the economy dictates that they are more discerning and secondly, they know they can afford to wait and pick the best and unless the part-time job is directly related to their field of study, it doesn't carry as much weight as it previously did.
