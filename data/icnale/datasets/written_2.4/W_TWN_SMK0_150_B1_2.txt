In nowadays, because the fast living pace, and the requests of high standard of living, some bad habits become the way to release the pressure that result from pursuing these things. Smoking is one of them, and it is also the normal one. But, I think smoking is not a good habit for people to maintain it, no matter to ones or even the others health, and especially in the public place. Smoking affects not only the smokers' health, but also the people around. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places, especially in the restaurants. Every human being who stays in the restaurants, they have the right to ask for the better surrounding. The customers pay for dinner, so they have the right to possess and pursue the best surrounding. Smoking always affects the atmosphere, mood and also the health of the people in the restaurants. To bear the mind in the interest of health of whole people and also it is the best way for some people who addicts to smoke to quit this bad habit. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and also the public place in the country. Generally speaking, health is better than wealth.
