The problem of smoking is becoming more and more important these years. About this topic, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As it is known to all, smoking does harm to people's health. It destroys a person's lung gradually. Pneumonia, 'the poor man's friend', is a serious disease which is brought to people mostly by cigarettes. At first a person begins to cough a little, than gradually he cough for completely an hour, and finally smoking sends him to death. Smoking is terrible. However, smoking in public areas like restaurants is even more terrible. When a man smokes in a restaurant, the other people can also smell the harmful smoke even if they are not smoking. This is 'passive smoking'. The person who smokes in restaurants does harm not only to his own health, but also to others, which is immoral. We shouldn't do such kind of things. For all these reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The next time you see someone smoking in public areas, especially restaurants, try to stop him. Let's make our world a better place together by not smoking.
