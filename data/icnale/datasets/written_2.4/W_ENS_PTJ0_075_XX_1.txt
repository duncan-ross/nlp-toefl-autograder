I don't agree with this statement that college students should have a part-time job because I feel that they have many other priorities that should come ahead of whatever small money they might be able to make by having a part-time job. Students who flounder their time on part-time work will undoubtedly find that their grades are slipping, and this is something that can affect their entire future because once you get some bad grades, it is very difficult to bring your GPA back up. Of course many companies would like for students to have a part-time experience, but a good GPA is also a good way of showing that you are responsible and hardworking. I think that students should be able to have the liberty to take the time after graduating to learn more about being really serious in working, so they should save part-time employment for immediately after graduation or for maybe in the summers when they don't have as much to do. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job as any benefits they might gain will be offset by the gains they will make after graduation and enrollment in the industry.
