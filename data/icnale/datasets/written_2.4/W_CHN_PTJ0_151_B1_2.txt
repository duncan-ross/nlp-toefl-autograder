Many students seldom agree with each other even in such trivial issues as preference whether college students should have a part-time job. In reality, it's rather superficial to simply say that a college student should obtain a part-time job. Students can earn some money in their free time if they receive a part-time job, and at the same time gain some individual experience through the job. Perhaps most importantly, we can broaden our horizon of mind through a part-time job and make our college more meaningful. And we are also aware of the tough to earn money. However, there are also adverse effects of getting a part-time job. The main responsibility of a college student is to pursue the course of study to the best of their ability. Therefore, as a college student, we still need to focus on our study. And sometimes the jobs some students take are not related to their major. Thus, it makes no sense to obtain such jobs. From my perspective, I am not in favor of getting a part-time job, the most important thing we need to do is just study. Trying to pass the post graduate entrance examinations would offer you more job opportunities and higher salary than just taking a part-time job.
