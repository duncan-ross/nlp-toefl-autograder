Smoking banned in resturant. I completely agree with that where it should be bannen in the resturant and all public places example building, shopping centers, clubs, street, park, squares, airport and hotels etc. They shouldn't be free to smoke elsewhere. Smoking has been shown to be dangerous to health. The simple fact is though that smokers are affecting the health of non-smokers as well as their own. I really hate is walking down the street behind someone smoking a cigarette. We should afford to break smoking. I propose that we should make a campaign about smoking. It causes harm not only to the individuals who are smoking, but to the people around them too. They should smoke in thier own places. At lest ban it 100 feet from a restaurant! I don't care if you smoke outside so long as it's not a confined space or venue, but if we're inside, please go outside to smoke your cancer sticks. Smoking is an addiction. Smoking a cigarettes is not benefit to you. Smoking is gross, extremely unhealthy, stinky, and totally uncool. Everyone should quit smoking right away! "I can't stop smoking" That is the stupidest argument I've heard. The government should be strictly anti-smoking law in place.
