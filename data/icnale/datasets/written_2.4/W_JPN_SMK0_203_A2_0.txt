I don't agree with this opinion. I think we don't need to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. First these days almost restaurants have smoking seats and non-smoking seats. I think that this way is very good. Indeed I don't smoke and don't like tobacco's smoke. However thanks to separate smoking area and non-smoking area I feel comfortable at the restaurants. Some people may claim that tobacco's smoke flow to a non-smoking area and smokes are affected their health, what is called passive smoking. Surely passive smoking attacks human's health. But if smoking is banned at all the restaurants, we cannot escape from passive smoking. Because humans have already polluted the air by tobacco's smoke. If you completely want not to have passive smoking, you must use a mask always. So we non-smokers should bear to passive smoke. Second I think we should not blame smokers. It's because smokers have to pay tobacco tax. In Japan it is important to receive tobacco tax. Tobacco tax is large. Today Japan has a lot of debts. If revenue of tobacco tax gradually decreases, Japanese debts increase and consumption tax rise surely. Finally I think that we non- smokers need to care about smokers little more. Smoking is the way of refreshing for smokers. If they cannot smoke at the restaurants, they don't feel comfortable at the restaurants. Therefore I don't agree with this topic. Thank you.
