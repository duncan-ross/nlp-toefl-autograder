Surrounding environment is not healthy anymore, be it water, weather, etc. The development of motor vehicles was fast enough. Also add water pollution around us plus the pollution from cigarette smoke. Speaking cigarette that problem occurs pros cons how best way to reduce health problems from smoking. Cigarettes are not only harmful to people who suck but also threaten the health of people who inhaling the smoke more known with the term passive smoking. Many say passive smoking is far more threatened than active smokers. Current health government therefore emphasizes how we can reduce pollution due to cigarette smoke by banning smoking in public places such as restaurants, malls etc.. Ban smoking in public places is very appropriate because the government encouraged cigarette smoke not only harm the health of people who suck but also for the convenience of people in the surrounding and environment. People who come to the restaurant must be told not to smoke so that they not harm other customers who are eating in the restaurant. Several danger of smoking include lung cancer, impotency, heart disease and still many others. So I agree that restaurant must not allow customers to smoke while they are in the restaurant.
