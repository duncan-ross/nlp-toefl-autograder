I don't agree to a college student to have a part-time job is important. Studying is the top 1 to students, always we have a lot of homework and tests, so we don't have other time to handle part-time job. Maybe some students need money to keep themselves life that is ok, but some students just want to buy a lot something they like which have very high price not the comstudents can pay for one and they could buy more and more that is very bad circle, if they can keep their money to bank or give their parents, maybe the condition is better. Part of part-time job are very tired, if human feel tired who didn't want to study, that is over a student should to do. Maybe we can from those part-time jobs get some experience but not every part-time job could do. Maybe for some students they don't get grade they just nothing to do, so they just want a com-part-time job, not have any soul in their future. I feel time is money, to do part-time job just now can get money but not in future, if we spent the same time in studying in future we can get more and more money but not now. So I don't agree.
