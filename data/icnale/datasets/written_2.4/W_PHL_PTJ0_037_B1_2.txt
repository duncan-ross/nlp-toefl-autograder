Since most of the family's before face mild or extreme poverty, most of the students got part time jobs in restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores and etc in order to get proper education. They use their salaries to pay for their tuitions, books, clothes and other necessities. That is why dual roles of college students as part time workers and students have been common since our fathers ' time. I remember my father telling me stories about his experiences as a working student during his college years. He said that having the role of a working student was very hard because being able to maintain both his work and studies was a difficult task. There were times when he was exhausted from his work, yet he could not rest because he still had to do his assignments and study for the lessons. But after a period of time, he left his job in order to fully concentrate on his studies. Based on my father's past experiences, I can only say that part time jobs for college students may hinder their goals in getting good grades. Some students may say that they can maintain and excel both their academics and work, but there will come a time when their health might collapse due to exhaustion, extreme pressure and lack of proper sleep. Others may say that they will get part time jobs inside their schools as scholarship grants, but even this may hinder their grades because of the conflicting schedules. They may say that they will find time to finish both their assignments and jobs, but what if their classes are until 5PM and they have no long breaks? College students may take part time jobs as long as they can handle all the workload, manage their grades and maintain their health.
