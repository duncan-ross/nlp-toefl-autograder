Nowadays, the law of banning smoking in public places like restaurants, cinema and shopping malls has been implemented and upheld in Hong Kong. I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking is scientifically evident harmful to health. Statistics show doubt that smoking is related to many diseases such as respiratory diseases and lung cancers. Besides, cigarettes contain tar and nicotine which are harmful to pregnant women, and even the fetuses, seriously these toxins will cause miscarriage for pregnant women. On top of this, passive smoking is found to be more harmful than to smokers themselves. Since smokers can still exhale carcinogenic substances, however, the second hand smokers are forced to absorb such toxins. Added to this, implementation of no-smoking ban at all restaurant can save the government expenditure on medical care and treatments in the long term. The environment of Hong Kong will be improved and fewer people will suffer from respiratory diseases because of a significant drop of heavy smokers. Secondly, there are always specific smoking areas for smokers, they can enjoy smoking in these smoking zones without disturbing other people. The public areas should entertain the majority but not the minority. Lastly, smokers should consider and respect the rights of other people. Parents are the role models of teenagers who will follow the footsteps of adult smokers. Thus, they are advised to quit this bad habit. As a result, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
