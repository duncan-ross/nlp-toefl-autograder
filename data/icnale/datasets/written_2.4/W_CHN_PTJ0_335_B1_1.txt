I support the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons are as followed. First, when doing a part-time job, college students will get to know how hard it is to make money. As a result, they will learn to save money and won't waste money on unnecessary things. In a long run, students will be able to save money all through their lives. I consider that it is very profitable for student's career. Second, students who get a part-time job will be able to be accustomed to the society more quickly than those who don't. They will make fewer mistakes than others. So when searching for a job, students who used to have a part-time job will be more competitive and there is more possibility for them to find a better job. Third, also the last one, students who used to get a part-time job at college can deal with relationships better than those who don't. When working for a company, those students who can deal with relationship well will get more opportunities. This also promises a better life in future for them.. As mentioned above, I think that it is better for a college student to do a part-time job.
