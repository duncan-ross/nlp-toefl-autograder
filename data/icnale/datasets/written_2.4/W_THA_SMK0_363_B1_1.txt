Nowadays, a lot of people especially teenagers tend to smoke cigarettes more than in the past. It's quite common to see people smoke in the public. As we all know, a cigarette is addictive. It's a kind of drugs. It's harmful to our health for all of those nearby who don't and do smoke. Is it worth having healthy food while inhaling smoke? Recently, there has been many smoke-free areas in the public, in the hotels, or even in the restaurants. But still, there're designated areas for smokers too. Non-smokers will never love to smell the hazardous smoke when they hang out with friends or go out for dinner. The smoking ban in restaurants is a good. Most people who don't smoke still disagree with this behavior I agree whit them because smoking is dangerous to health for smoker and people near around. It should be a new law and focus on this as much.. I think smoking habit should be more restricted in the public, particularly in restaurant. Smoking in restaurants makes a person in there smell bad and they'll get an effect as a smoker too Everyone know that smoking is danger for your body and a nearly people. Then if some smoking in a restaurant. It is really impolite act. I think a government must banned it and make a stronger rule for a person who is smoking in restaurant. Not only smoker will have a healthy life everyone in a restaurant and all of people in Thailand will be happiness.
