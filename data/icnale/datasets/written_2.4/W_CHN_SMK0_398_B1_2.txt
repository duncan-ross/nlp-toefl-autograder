I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As is known to all, smoking does great harm to one's health. In Old days smoking in restaurants is a serious problem in China. But after many cities ban smoking in restaurants, I think the situation is much better than before. Some restaurants completely ban smoking and much more ones have set up both smoking and nonsmoking areas for customers. But still some customers don't care about it at all. They just believe that, as a customer, they are entitled to do anything they want, including smoking. So I list three reasons for totally smoking ban in restaurants. First of all, as I have told before, smoking is harmful to one's health. Secondly, no one deserves second-hand smoke, which is even more harmful to non-smokers. We should stop smokers smoking anyway and to some extent, a tough attitude will force the smokers to change their bad habits. Last but not least, since our motherland, China, has successfully held the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 World Expo, everyone of us should do our best to give the world a good sense of China, just do it from completely banning smoking at all the restaurants. So we can enjoy delicious food and ourselves.
