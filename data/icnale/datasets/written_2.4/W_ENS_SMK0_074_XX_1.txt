I take health and fitness pretty seriously, so whenever a discussion on smoking or other drug usage comes up, I am often quick to say that people should just treat themselves better and not be so stupid. However, in the past years I have seen that there has been a lot of backlash against restaurants in my hometown that have banned smoking, and I don't really think it is fair. Whether or not it was a good move to ban smoking at the restaurants is already in the past now because these restaurants have lost some of their profit by following the state law to ban smoking in restaurants. Before this happened, many people thought that the restaurants would make even more money if they became cleaner, but it is hard to see the good mom and pop restaurants go under just because they are doing as the government tells them to do. I don't know a lot about Japan, but I do know that if they have local communities that are anything like mine, there will be people who are negatively affected by a ban on smoking in restaurants, and it will be very painful for their fellow citizens to watch them struggle as a result of following orders.
