I think that it can do them good but I don't believe that it is important while they are at college. When I attended university, I did have a part-time job, as a matter of fact, I had three or four if I recall correctly. Irrespective though, while I gleaned some useful ideas and cash for my efforts, I do not believe that this is important for everybody. We all have different personalities, needs, desires and what have you, so I cannot truthfully state that what was good for me is necessarily important for all other students. We would need to analyse that on an individual basis, situation by situation, student by student because it is subjective. Maybe that is just my thinking other of course have their own opinions and I have heard many of the arguments for and against already. If we approach the topic objectively and with limited bias, how could anybody conclude honestly, that part-time work was good for Students A, B and C therefore, it must be the right course of action for everyone. Generally speaking, at most colleges and universities, there are many part-time workers, but that still does not mean that we can automatically jump to the conclusion that it is important for everybody.
