As we know Smoking cigarette is a bad behavior especially that person smokes in public places such as parks, restaurants, bus stops and etc. We have been taught since we were child that people who smoke the cigarettes will be sick because of lung cancer. In fact, they will not be sick but who close them up risk to be sick. Because the people who smoke always emit the smoke, they don't receive smoke as much as who is rounding them. So the people who close them up get smoke directly by breathing. In restaurants, all owners realize how bad cigarettes are so they try to campaign by sticking signal 'No smoking' across the restaurants and also set the specific area called 'Smoking area'. Although these ways have been used for long time, the people who want to smoke, they still do. I think those people are really bad and have no any subconscious. Owners should catch up and fine them seriously! From the above, everyone see and realize that smoking in public hurt people who around you. Then the people who have behavior like this should adjust and improve yourselves. I'm the one who really hate smoking because smoking cigarettes has no any advantages. There are only disadvantages especially health and spend wasting money. So I agree with 'Banned Smoking at all the restaurants in the country'. But I think we shouldn't ban only restaurants, we should ban cigarette in all public places. Last, the best way to solve this problem is Stop Smoking for Good Life! :- )
