I am very surprised to hear that smoking is not already banned at restaurants in Japan. I always think of Japan as this futuristic place where everyone is enlightened, healthy, and technologically savvy. These may be stereotypes, but if smoking really is allowed in restaurants in Japan it would be in sharp contrast to the country's worldwide image. Smoking is not allowed in the restaurants here, and I think this is a good thing. This is because smoking can give you cancer and lung cancer in particular is one of the worst ways to go. Unfortunately, smoking is highly addictive and people who start having a very difficult time quitting, but this is no excuse to allow them to affect the health of other people by smoking in public places. Finally, smoking is very expensive. We learned in school that every year a smoker may spend thousands of dollars on cigarettes. I have to say that I think this is a waste of money, because cigarettes don't really do anything for you. Alcohol is kind of the same way, that is, it doesn't really do anything for you, but at least when you drink safely and do not drive, you will not affect the health of other people around you.
