Government has been claiming that smoking is harmful for human body, huge pressure for health system; complete ban makes government's policy consistent. Complete ban gives public a positive impression: government cares public health a lot, makes effect for our living environment. It helps government to increase its governance. Complete ban educates public not to smoke in a positive way. Health education is a long period job. It is significant to completely ban smoking in restaurants. Complete ban protect employees in a healthy environment. Government should protect citizens who are fair to apply any kind of job if they want. If that is the case, the government should also protect all of employees in a non-smoking working place. Someone may argue that restaurant is no a public area, restaurant owner has right to restrict customers, for example, some restaurants reject untidy customers. Firstly, restricting customers who have to suffer second-hand smoking does not make any sense. Secondly, workers in the restaurant should be protected away from smoking; if restaurant owner reject job applicants because they do not smoke, it must violate related laws of labour. Restaurant is not a completely private area, which owners can do anything they want except crimes; restaurant owners have responsibility for his employees.
