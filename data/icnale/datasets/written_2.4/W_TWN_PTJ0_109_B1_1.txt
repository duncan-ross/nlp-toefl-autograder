As a college student, there are many items to do; for example, attending the courses, handing in the homework on time, study and so on in four years. Although having a part-time job does not list on the school's rule, it is an important mission for a college student. The major reason is that the students will get the extra experiences which are not appeared on the text-book. First of all, a student who has a part-time job will meet the various kinds of friends. The system of the job is more complex than school's one; as a result, it needs different persons - the professional managers, someone is good at conversation, or someone cook very well -to get the target. Hence, having a part-time job is a chance to meet the friends. Second, a student will exam the differences between the course and the real situation, or will apply the knowledge which have been got from course into a real case. For students who major in marketing, they will learn the experiences about the art of conversation with customers when they be a salesman in market. For students study in cooking, it is important to have a part-time job in restaurant. They will realize what consumers like after being a waiter. The part-time job provides students the opportunities to contact with customers, and induces students' creativity. On the other hand, some parents worried about the conflict between the part-time job and the students' grade in school. In my opinion, keeping the balance these two parts is an important lesson for the students, how to manage their time well or doing anything efficient. For these reasons, having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. In short, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
