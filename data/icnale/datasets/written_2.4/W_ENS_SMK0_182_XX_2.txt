I don't agree that is should be banned all over Japan because the logistics of policing any legislation banning smoking across Japan would be horrendous and extremely difficult to enforce. I can accept that smokers and non-smokers sharing space in some restaurants may make it uncomfortable for the non-smokers, but that is no excuse to slap down a nation wide ban. There are other options and technology solutions that may resolve the situation. For example ensuring that restaurants have adequate ventilation and effective partitions protecting non-smokers from inhaling smoke fumes or build more restaurants, both smoking and non-smoking and boost the economy as well as split the two groups. There are many modern high technology appliances that will extract and filter out up to over ninety-eight percent of the chemicals found in cigarettes which would have an immediate effect and alleviate non-smoker concerns without having to build anything. I think that if the restaurants and held talks with representatives of both groups with the assistance of an independent mediator, this would provide ample opportunity to discuss and implement some of the solutions offered in this essay and many other options without resorting to bans at this time and they may find that just maybe, a ban is not necessary at all.
