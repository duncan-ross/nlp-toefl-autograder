In today's tough job market, you need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on you hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. Customer service jobs in retail and food service require you to work with challenging people, but after seeing how things are on this side of the counter, you will approach the world with a much more compassionate attitude. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management. If you keep your priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least tolerable, you will be adding an important element to your future resume: experience.
