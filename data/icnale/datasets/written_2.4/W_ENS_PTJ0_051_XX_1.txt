Whether or not I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job pales in comparison to the cold, hard facts. Recently, I read a report in which it was stated that more than 70% of college students in America had a part-time position. Therefore, whether you want to or not, the fact of the matter is that most kids these days are doing part-time work, and if you do not do the same as them you may be left behind in the continually competitive world of business. Being in college shelters you only somewhat from this way of doing things, and so you should give yourself a chance to be exposed to the real way of business so that you are not completely shocked when you graduate from college. I think that the students of today are more hardworking and more focused than the students of prior generations, and we have to work much harder to keep up with the always improving standard of living. There is therefore no doubt in my mind that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because even though you can go back and forth on the subject, you cannot deny what is happening in the world today.
