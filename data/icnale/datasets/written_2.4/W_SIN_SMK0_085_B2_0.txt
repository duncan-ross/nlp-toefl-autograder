Smoking is a common sight in cities, especially in more developed countries. One possible reason is because of the high stress level in cities, causing many to take up smoking in order to reduce stress despite the possible health problems that smokers might face. However, smoking is steadily becoming a social issue in recent years. Many smokers have been smoking in public places such as lifts and restaurants, causing inconvenience to the non-smokers due to the smell and smoke, which irritates the senses. As a result, the general public has called for smoking to be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In my opinion, despite the inconvenience that this ban will cause to non-smokers, I still agree with this complete ban. Firstly, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants to minimize any negative health effects to non-smokers. Since restaurants are places that are widely patronised, non-smokers are likely to constantly breathe in the smoke from cigarettes nearby, thus there will be significantly higher chances of these non-smokers developing lung diseases in the future. If this persists, this will cause increased health issues among the general public, resulting in greater healthcare expenditure by the government which can possibly be prevented if the ban is implemented. Additionally, this ban will improve the economy of the country. By banning smoking in restaurants, the ambience of the restaurants will be improved, thus improving the quality of dining at the restaurants. This will attract more of the general public and also tourists to patronise restaurants, increasing the restaurants' revenue and thus improving the economy of the country. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country due to health and financial reasons. Implementing this ban will lead to various benefits for the country.
