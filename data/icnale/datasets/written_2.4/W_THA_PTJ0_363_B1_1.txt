A part-time job, it is a popular in a college students to have a part-time job. It make money for them, make them can buy something that they need and make them have a pocket money. But it is based on work she did. I agree that college students to have a part-time job. It makes extra income during study. It is training a good experience for you. I used to think it will do part-time job but I have no free time and study hard. I think college students that do part time job is good. They must be people with high liability. They have to study and work together. So they should learn to share a time for study and part-time job for good. They should not choose a work more than a study because study is important. You should think well before going to do part-time job that will not make you loss for study. However, it all depends on you. You have to decide for yourself whether you do or not do and have enough time. If you decide to do it, you should do it your best.
