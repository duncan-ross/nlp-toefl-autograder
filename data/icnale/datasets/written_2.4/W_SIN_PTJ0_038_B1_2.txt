Before I start my argument, I will like to clarify that "working" and "interning" are different terms. We work with the sole intention of earning our keep, but we intern because we want to broaden our horizons. I do not agree that it is important for college students to work, even if it is just a part time job. Being college students, I believe that our primary job is to study well. Our parents send us to school with the hope that we will focus on what we have on hand, so that we will not be distracted by what is not something we have to worry about at moment. Besides, today's employers look for candidates with experience and credible degrees, not simply a determination that screams. Working will simply take our minds off studying. A healthy lifestyle at our age (as tertiary students) dictates us to study and play hard- we hardly have time to stress over work. In addition, Singapore's education is heavily subsidized, and there are many loan schemes that we can take up to lighten our parents' burden. All these initiatives gear towards putting our minds off monetary issues. I believe that the only way we can lighten our parents' load- is to simply work hard, excel in what we do to pave a bright future for ourselves. That being said, we should open ourselves to internships, because it complements our education and gives us a glimpse of an adult's working world. If what we do helps us to make new discoveries, then it is justified, because that is what "Education" is all about. If we are just working for the sake of earning money, then why not we focus on our studies now, do better in school so that we can earn more in future?
