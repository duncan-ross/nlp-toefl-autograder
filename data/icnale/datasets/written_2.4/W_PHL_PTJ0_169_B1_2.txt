Part-time jobs have become a part of history for a college student's life, mostly on the marginalized areas of the country. The importance of having a part-time job in college is subjective. It depends on what the objective of the student is. If the objective of the student is to support his school life because he is poor, then it is important; if the objective of the student is to maximize his college life by experiencing everything, then having a part-time job is a must. However, if the objective is just to study and money is not a problem and maximizing college life is not the priority, then having a part-time job is unimportant. A part-time job is usually part of a scholarship program. Sometimes, the students seek independent help. It usually lasts four to five a day, no longer than a total of twenty hours a week. This is why having a part-time job's importance is subjective. It takes a considerable amount of time on the student's part. Sometimes, fate leaves no choice for the student when money becomes an issue. However, on the bright, there are also some people who take it just to experience it. This is also important in terms of developing the student as a whole. It develops his sense of responsibility, while at the same time given the choice to quit at his own convenience because the job was not forced in the first place.
