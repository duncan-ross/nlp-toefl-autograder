I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let's discuss the restaurant first. So what dose restaurant mean? A restaurant means some place where you have a meal. After a lot of tiring work, you must be tired and hungry. You enter a restaurant and you feel better. You take a seat and figure out what you are going to eat, full of happy minds. However, God plays a joke. A big man with a rude face, sitting next to you, smokes as if there is only himself in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the sick dirty cloud drives towards to you. I promise you will get bad emotions back as soon as you sniff it and you will never want to meet the big man again unless you are this kind of impolite people. If smoking can just disturb your minds without other harmful effect, we needn't take pains to ban it. What's worse, smoking is consuming your life. You can google smoking & bad effect and there is no doubt that you will receive millions of results that tells you the deadly effect of smoking. The main cause is lung cancer. When you smoke, the smoke which contains thousands of harmful things goes into your lung and destroys your body from lung to every place in your body. Just imagine that your cells, your tissues and even your heart are damaged by cigarettes you happily smoke. You are killing yourself! It is much worse that you are murdering others through your pleasant cigarettes. Due to those reasons, we can easily conclude that banning smoking is necessary. We all should say no to cigarettes to save ourselves and people around us.
