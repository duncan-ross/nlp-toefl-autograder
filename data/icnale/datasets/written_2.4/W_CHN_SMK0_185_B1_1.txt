People always have different points of view on even a tiny issue. So, people's answers to this question vary from one to another. Some people are in favor of smoking at restaurants while some others insist that it is unsuitable to smoke at there. For me, I agree with the latter. My reasons are mainly as followed:To start with, smoking brings many disadvantages to us. People who often smoke always get higher possibility of being ill. Smoking will cause a series of illness such as cancer, heart disease, and some other problems. Because of that, their lifetimes are usually shorter then those who do not. Secondly, people should obey their obligation to not smoke in all public places, including restaurants, shopping malls, transportation and so on. If one can't help smoking in public places, they should go to the room which is prepared for smokers specially. In addition, second-hand smoke does harm to nonsmokers more than to smokers. Smoking in public places makes nonsmokers feel unpleasant from time to time. However, on the one hand, others think smoking in public places is ok. They view smoking as a important table manner especially in China's tables. On the other hand, good sales of cigarettes bring considerable benefits for these restaurants. Maybe the restaurateurs will not give up the way of earning money. To sum up, what we should do is to improve ourselves to become qualified smokers. Don't disturb others when we enjoy the pleasure of smoking.
