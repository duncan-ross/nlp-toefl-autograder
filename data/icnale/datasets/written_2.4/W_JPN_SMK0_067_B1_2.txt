I agree with this opinion. I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants. The reason is that no matter where it is the public place, I think that smoking should completely be banned. And now the place is especially restaurants. In there, many people who are smoker or non-smoker are eating meals. And they are having a fun to eat or to talk with friends. So smoking lead to non-smoker having uncomfortable feelings. Indeed, if I were a smoker, I wouldn't want to ban to smoke at any place. But, I think that it important to ban to smoke for non-smoker, because of passive smoking. It means that non-smoker can smoke, if there is a smoker near to non-smoker. The material which passive smoking includes is more dangerous than one which direct smoking dose. If there is such a thing for a long time, non-smoker may have a cancer even if they have never smoked yet. So smoking near to non-smoker may be dangerous to smoke for non-smoker. This passive smoking can be at everywhere smoking people are, and now the place is in door so it can be more dangerous because of too near to non-smoker people. There are some reasons that I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants.
