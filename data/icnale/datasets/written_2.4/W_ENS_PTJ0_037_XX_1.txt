I think part-time work is important for college students. I will soon be obtaining my Ph. D., and if it wasn't for part-time work, there is no way that I would have come this far by myself. My parents cannot help me with paying for my tuition to the extent that some other kids' parents can, so I have been forced to provide for myself every step of the way. I feel this has made me into a stronger person. I have learned a lot about what it needs to be a responsible adult, and I have learned a lot about how to manage my time so that I have enough of it to do everything I want to do. Next, there are some kids who are very immature and could use part-time work in order to help them grow up a little bit. This was never the case for me, or at least I don't think so, but many kids these days are more irresponsible than I feel they should be. Lastly, even if there are kids who do not need to pay for their own tuition, part time work can help them make enough money to buy things that they desire.
