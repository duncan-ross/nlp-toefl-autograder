At the moment, the number of smokers in the country is increasing. Smokers can be seen almost in all places. But smoking should be done in limited places only because it affects not only the health of the smokers but also those of the people who are around them, it also affects our environment since it contributes to pollution. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants in the country, but instead it should be done only in some designated areas. Today, smoking is already a habit of many people that cannot be stopped. And we should also respect them if it is what they wantSmokers should consider and respect other people who can be affected by their smoking, for example, a smoker may not know if one person who is near him has asthma or allergic to smoke. I myself am a smoker and I find it stress-relieving to smoke wile sipping my cup of coffee in a restaurant. However, I am mindful of the customers who are also within the area because I know for a fact that my smike may irritate them. Assign areas for smoking in restaurants so that people like me can have place to go to where I can eat and drink and at the same time indulge in a stress-relieving activity which is smoking.
