 Nowadays, more and more college students would like to do some part time jobs, the majority of whom tend to be tutors. And several of them prefer to hand out leaflets for kinds of newspaper or magazines. Is this right? For one thing, we students can certainly make money in this method, so that we can relieve our parents' burden. What's more, you know, we will achieve more experience by doing part time jobs, which, of course, will temper ourselves and make us more mature. Every coin has two sides. As is known to all, university is a place where we acquire knowledge as much as we can, while people can hardly finish doing many things perfectly in the same time. That is to say, the more time we use in doing part time jobs, the less we use in studying. It will cause a negative influence in our study. All in all, as far as I am concerned, we should make a balance between part time job and study. If you really need to do some part time jobs, please keep the follow tips in mind. College study should be ranged in the first place. There is no excuse that we get a bad score.
