I believe that is a fairly broad and generic statement and I would have to disagree. Commonsense and schoolboy logic dictates that it is only important for college students to have a part-time job if either, they need the money or it is part of an internship. I know that with my own daughter, she is working by choice, three afternoons per week because I told her that while I was happy to pay for her education that did not include paying for entertainment seven days per week. She does have friends however, who are not so fortunate and they are paying their way through college as best they can under the circumstances. I think that it is tough enough for college students these days to excel in college without having to work as well. In some respects, I feel that those who have to work harder for it, do make some gains in character building but I also believe that given the right upbringing and supportive environment, these could also be had without working while trying to study at the same time. The marketplace is a lot tougher these days and I believe that it is in each student's best interests to focus on study and graduation first, as much as their individual circumstance will allow. In my opinion, this is a full-time endeavor on its own.
