Talking about job that job is the most important thing that everyone must have it. Because job is one of many tools which helps someone continues a life in this world. We often find many people who do not have a job, they will be difficult to find something to eat for their life and maybe for their families. That is why job is the most important thing to have for someone who wants to continue the life. I agree strongly for the college students to have a part time job, because it will make the students be theirselves and will not depend on their parents, their families, and the others, at least they can help their parents in finding the money. Beside of this, if the college students had have the job, they will get more experiences. Because the college students will get more experiences and sciences not in the class, but out of the class. In the class we just get the formula or the manner. But the main point is that we can apply what we have got from the lecture. So if the college students have a part time job, they will get everything in their life.
