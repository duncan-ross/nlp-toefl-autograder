Restaurants are popular places where people usually smoke because what's better to do after eating, smoking. Is it necessary to smoke inside a restaurant? Of course not, because eating while smelling smoke would really ruin my appetite so as a customer I wouldn't want people smoking in a place where I am eating, it is very inappropriate. Normally people eating in a restaurant would go outside if they would want to smoke, only if the restaurant has no smoking area. Most restaurants now have smoking areas since a good number of people are smoking and it would be very inconvenient for them if they would still have to exit the venue just to smoke, that's why they built that area is for the people who smokes convenience, they could eat while smoke and no one will complain since they are in the smoking area. I am not a fan of smoking, and I am sure a good number of people aren't also, that is why I believe smoking should be banned in the restaurants because it would be very inappropriate for customers who do not smoke. A restaurant is a place to eat, not a place to smoke. It is very unhealthy, and you would also bring a health risk to other people's lives if you smoke in an area where it is closed. If a person would want to smoke, it would be better if he approached the smoking area, or proceed outside of the restaurant so that he would not disturb or make someone feel uncomfortable because of the putrid smell.
