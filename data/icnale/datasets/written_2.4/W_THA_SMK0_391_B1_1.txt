Smoking is very hazard for your health. People who smoke a lot will be sick. Smoking will be the cause of lung cancer and other diseases. The worst thing is people who smoking will receive only 30% of the smoke. But people who don't smoking but breathe the smoke in their lungs will receive 70% of the smoke. That mean people who don't smoking but stand next to the smoker have more risk to have lung-cancer and other diseases about respiration system more than the smoker. Now, we know about the danger of smoke so we have to do something to protect ourselves and our health from the smoke. One thing that everyone can do is to ban the smoker who smoking in public place. Especially in the place that wind can't blow through for example the pub, the restaurant, the gym etc. Because these places have a lot of people that don't want to receive the smoke. If the smokers want to smoking, it should be somewhere that far from many people or public places. Or the smoker should see the doctor to cure and stop smoking. If these ways can't stop smoking, the government should draw the law about smoking.
