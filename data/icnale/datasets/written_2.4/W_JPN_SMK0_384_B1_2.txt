I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't smoke and don't want to breathe the smoke that someone blows, but this idea is very excessive. We should take smoker's feelings into consideration, and that idea completely ignores their feelings. Certainly, I can understand the idea that no-smokers want to keep away smoke from them, because I sometimes think so. Tobacco's smoke has many problems. For example tobacco's smoke does a lot of damage to our health. The possibility that you may get cancer and a lot of other illness increases very much by breathing tobacco's smoke. In addition to this fact, smoke does the same damage to secondary smoker, so no-smoker but secondary smoker is as good as smoker. From a viewpoint of no-smoker, that they can't allow existence of smoke is convinced. Smoker enjoys smoking and look forward to smoking, but when they go to a restaurant, if smoking is completely banned, they can't enjoy and relax. Considering both sides' opinion, the idea that we make the smoking place that is completely isolated from no-smoking places and of course they can eat is best. Restaurants should be the place that all people enjoy and relax, so smoker should care about no-smoker's feelings and no-smoker mustn't exclude smoker from restaurant.
