Smoking is a habit that people pick up over time, and most of the time they do not drop the habit so easily even if they wanted to. Banning smoking completely at restaurants would mean clean air for the restaurant patrons. So is this a good thing or a bad thing? Banning smoking completely in restaurants would mean that non-smokers would be able to walk in and out of the restaurant, without worrying about smoke polluting the air they breathe which would allow them to enjoy their meal in peace. However, this would mean that smokers would no longer be able to get their fix and relax after a meal. Doing this might actually deter smokers from eating at restaurants because they can't fully enjoy themselves while eating there. However, because smoking is a choice, I feel that if smoking were to be banned completely in all restaurants, smokers would have to live with the decision and accept that their habit is not something everyone condones. Also, for the sake of everybody else who patronizes the restaurant, banning smoking completely, I feel, would be acceptable and fair to non-smokers. For the sake of the non-smoker's health, it should be banned at all restaurants. If smokers need to smoke, then they can walk outside of the restaurant to do it, away from people who wish to breathe fresh air. (228 words)
