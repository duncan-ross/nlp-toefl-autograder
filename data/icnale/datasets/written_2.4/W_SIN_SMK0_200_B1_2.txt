While it is absolutely true that smoking is unhealthy for both the smoker himself and the surrounding people, we have no rights to stop people smoking if this action does not affect the welfare of the general public. Nevertheless, it is not realistic to ban smoking in all the restaurants because restaurants are important places for people to socialize and relax and smoking has become a common practice during family and business gathering in certain culture. Instead, restaurants should set up separate smoking area that will allow smokers to smoke. By doing so, both smokers and non-smokers who dine at the restaurants will be satisfied. Although this seems to be the best way out for both groups of people, it does not mean that the society should encourage smoking. Smoking is not only unhealthy for the smokers, but will also bring negative externalities to the whole community. Allowing people smoking in designated area is perhaps the best way for the society to show respect and equality for each individual. Besides, to discourage people smoking in public areas, the restaurants could also choose to charge a higher price for smokers or offer cigarettes-substitutes such as candies or drinks to smokers to help them inhibit their addiction temporarily.
