Having a part-time job allows the student to earn his own allowance. This will lessen the burden of their parents who already have to support them in their expensive tertiary level education. The amount earned from a part-time job may not be much but it will offset a student's spending to an extent. Moreover, having a part-time job instils discipline in the student to manage his time between work and studies. With a part-time job, the time left to study is very much lessened. This may push the student to better manage his time in order to have sufficient time left to study. With less time to study, the student has to ensure that whatever remaining time he has left is spent fruitfully. In addition, a part-time job may teach his valuable lessons for the future work life. For example, communication skills between colleagues can be learnt at his part-time job, be it an office or retail job and responsibility to complete a given task. Lastly, a part-time job while studying serves as a prelude to the work life that will come. This may better prepare the student from transition from studying to work and possibly help in a smoother transition.
