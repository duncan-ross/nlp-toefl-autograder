I agree students to have a part-time job. I have no part-time job now, but I had it three months ago. However I earned a little money, I could bought things I need when I was having it. But I am depending on money sending from my parents now. I feel so sorry for them, because I think I can't live by myself. Of course I don't think I can get enough money for my school life by part-time job. I need helps from my parents or school. But some money helps my parents' money, I believe. However, I don't agree with doing part-time jobs too hard. I am sometimes hearing friends' talk, I can't have time to study to do part-time job. I think it is wrong for our work, studying. We are going to school to study. We do not go to school to use money that earn by part-time job completely. So I think it is good to have a part-time job if there is some time we can use freely. When we do some part-time jobs, we can learn manners, behaviors, and many things we have to do in society. It is important for students to select their jobs.
