It's not. But it never ceases to amaze me how many ordinary people believe that it is and then they regurgitate an awful lot of these boring old wives tales like; character building, responsibility, work experience etc. What a load of bollocks. It is quite simply a case by case scenario really and that's all it is. Those that need a few extra quid for university fees, college fees, books, party cash or living expenses, work part-time jobs and those who are cashed up, don't. That's it in a nutshell really and end of story. If they just want work experience, then they choose to work in a career related company during the holidays. I honestly can't understand what all the kerfuffel is about when they rave on about character building either. I mean, if I want character building, then I'll join the military or a religious sect. I am not going to build much character stacking shelves in the evenings or delivering newspapers at 4AM in the morning when I should be sleeping, studying or both. Where I come from, if I was in a job interview and told the interviewer that I delivered newspapers in the mornings they would probably say, straight off the bat, "Oh I see, no cash hey?" It's not important to have a part-time job at all for college purposes unless you need the cash. Period!
