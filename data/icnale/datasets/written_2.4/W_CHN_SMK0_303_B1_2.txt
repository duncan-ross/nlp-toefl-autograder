I think smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. Although smoking is a common phenomenon, it is not accepted by most people. What is more, smoking is not only harmful to the smokers but also to the people around them. As we all know, restaurants are public places. Everyone has the responsibility to keep our environment clean and comfortable. But the smoke from cigarettes is very smoky. Above all, it is bad to our health. We can also imagine a situation. You are enjoying your wonderful meal with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Then suddenly a smell of ash floats to you. How will you feel? Maybe all your atmosphere will be destroyed. Maybe you won't want to stay in the restaurant any more. So smoking in the restaurant is unfair to other customers. It is bad manners to smoke in front of a lot of people. Limiting smoking in the restaurants will make contribution to making our society more civilized. As far as I am concerned 76% of people hate smoking. At the same time we should set a perception that smoking is not as cool as it is in the films. We college students shouldn't smoke in public places especially in the restaurants.
