In my opinion. I think part time job of Thai students are very good, because it help themselves and parent. If their family are poor them must work part time after finish class. Past time job are very necessary for some Thai student, because poor family. It does not easy for someone, but it easy for diligent student, because them must look for money for themselves. I agree with part time job and it is best idea for pool student. However study is the most important than part time job. It have time enough should make, but if not time should not make. Sometime working part time cannot help them, because working help look for money only, but it cannot help good study. If we look into point important of part time job, for example, look for money, using time and save money. After finish work them must do homework and get up to university working part time can make them have not time enough study. While them friend shopping, but them must work part time it very different. I would to talk past time job, it is necessary for some student for example. For pool student and them would like to help parent.
