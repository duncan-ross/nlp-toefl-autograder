I don't think so! School, university and college are all part of the learning years where everyone is supposed to get as much knowledge as they can, study hard, do good, graduate and be successful. That's the theory anyway and it falls far short of the reality. Students are expected to cram in as many of the books that educational institutions can lay their hands on, read them and sit for a series of large exams and tests that prove to be meaningless in the workplace. How can they do that and do it successfully, get good grades or scores and work as well? Something would have to give and I reckon that it would be their studies. It's a lot of information for anyone to cram in within a short space of time. If their time is divided between working, studying and generally just trying to have some sort of life while they are at college, that doesn't leave any time at all. Students are not robots or computers and need time to take everything in as well as some sort of learning system that supports their studies. If they have to work too and many do because they need the money, then how can they possibly devote enough time to study? It's just not that simple and education departments, governments and parents need to keep this in mind because it's the students who are constantly under pressure to do good. Why not give them the best chance to do well by relieving some of the financial and time pressures that many students suffer through just to get a piece of paper.
