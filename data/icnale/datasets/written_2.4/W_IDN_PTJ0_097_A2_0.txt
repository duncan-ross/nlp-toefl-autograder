Take a part time job while we are studying is a good idea and worth to try. First of all, we can earn some money for sure. With that money, we can buy something we like to buy, especially when our parents doesn't want to give the money because their think it is not really important. In other way, we also can keep that money and start learn to give 10% from that money to God, as what He word tells us to do. Secondly, by taking a part time job we will get some skills which are good for us now and then. Actually, we will not have many times when we take a job while we studying, but with the situation like that we will be push to be independent in manage our time and make our life more effective. The experience that we get from the job will be very useful for us someday when we enter the real job world. And the last, we will have more friends beside our friends in school or college. It is very good if us can learn something from the people in our work place like as how to be success. If we want to be success, we have to learn from those people who already be success before us. So, with so many advantages like that, I think have a part time job while studying is a good idea.
