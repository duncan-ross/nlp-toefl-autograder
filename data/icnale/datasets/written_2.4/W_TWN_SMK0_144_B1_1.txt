I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for many reasons. First, smoking affects others who are in the restaurant seriously. No matter how terrible influence the smoker does to his body, the second-hand smoke causes others indeed, which is the second reason. Third, the mod which smokers produce will pollute the clear air of public area. Many people who don't smoke always think why the smokers cannot adopt our advices to get rid of smoking. It is said that smokers cannot control their desire to get away from cigarette. Smokers smoke for many reasons. For example, after smoking they will feel released when they are under the pressure. Some teenagers think that it is cool to pick a cigarette across the finger. However, while smoking, they don't conscious that long-term smoking will damage to their lung. Moreover, it will get long cancer easily. Not only the smokers, but also the second-hand smokers. Therefore, I think that if the smokers insist not to protect their body, they should protect other people at least. So I definitely agree that smoking should be completely banned not only at all the restaurants, but in every public area in the country.
