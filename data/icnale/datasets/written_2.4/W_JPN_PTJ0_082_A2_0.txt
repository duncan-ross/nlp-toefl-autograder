I agree that college students have a part-time job. I think that college is not only a place where we study but also where we make humanity. Humanity is made when we have communication. And a part-time job is a good chance which we have a communication. So I agree with a part-time job. However, there are many kind of part-time job. Not all part-time jobs have a good effect on us. So we have to choose a part-time job carefully. I think that there are three conditions of a good part-time job. First is money. Most of us have a part-time job to get money. If we can get a lot of money, we will call it a good job. Second is a member of the job. Good communication requires good members. If there are people who don't have humanity, probably you are unwilling to be concerned with him or her. As a result, you can't have communication. Third is detail of the job. It is important that we choose a job that we can use our advantages. For example, People who are good at communication should choose the jobs which have many communications. And it is also good that people who are poor at choose the jobs as a practice. In the end, experiences of a part-time job have a good effect on us. So college students should have a part-time job.
