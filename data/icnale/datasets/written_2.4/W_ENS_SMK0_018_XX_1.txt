It is obvious that there are many proponents of banning smoking in Japanese restaurants or else the question would not have been posed. Even though I do not know much about Japan, I think it is safe to say that smoking in restaurants causes a problem for a lot of people. First are the other people who go to the restaurant. They probably have gone to the restaurants to enjoy a good meal in good company, and nothing ruins a nice night out more than a room foggy with smoke. Next, I think smoking is disrespectful to the people who work at the restaurant. Even though the other customers may only have to endure the second hand smoke for one or 2 hours, the restaurants staff has to work for as many as 8 hours or more at a time, and so they will have to be around smoke much longer. Also, the restaurant chefs probably put a lot of work into creating the menu and they work very hard to maintain the quality of their food. Smoking adds an aroma and an element to the atmosphere which even the best chef cannot deal with. For all of these reasons, banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would appear to be a good idea.
