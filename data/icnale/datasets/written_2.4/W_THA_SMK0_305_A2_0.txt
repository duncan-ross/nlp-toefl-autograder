I think this is different people have different rights. When the state that most people do not smoke. And smoking is hazardous to health legislation is to protect people, mostly non-smoking. However, any deprivation of their right to smoke at the same time People who smoke now almost no place to stand and sit in smoking. But still polite. Not come out mad as other groups. In addition, most people who smoke, I understand that where appropriate Or is not appropriate to smoke. In addition they made in the know. Who do not smoke, do not think that The smoking violation of their rights. Not thinking back, how those who do not smoke. Supported. From the state who smoke Lose his rights. But just as smokers do not want to build up conflicts. Because I understand the restaurant Building a non-smoking. A small garden outside. PC to smoke out those who sit Smoking in restaurants. Whether it is on no-smoking signs. Whether or not smoking is not already. No restrictions. Or request But a legal ban Smokers will be fined 2, 000 baht and the owner of the place may be fined up to 20, 000 Baht When people do illegal up. A function of the shop. Whether owners or managers that employees must attend. To remind people that know, otherwise the shop would be wrong as well I see from the side of those who do not smoke. I will give fair with What they do is not wrong to smokers out of favor do not smok.
