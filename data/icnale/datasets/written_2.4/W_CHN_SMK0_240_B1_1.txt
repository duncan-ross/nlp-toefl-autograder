Smoking in public places is immoral and even illegal in some cities. So I can see it's harmful to us. This kind of action must be stopped. Some eldership doesn't think highly of its harm, so they just carry on smoking in public places. Smoking is normal and necessary when meeting some old friends or relatives to them. Smoking helps them feel more relaxed and comfort. And some teenagers also smoke in public places. To them, smoking is cool; so they smoke to draw other's attention. People referred to above are selfish and foolish, they never think about other's and themselves' health. So I can't agree to their action. Knowing smoking in public places is harmful to others and themselves, why are there still so many people do like this? Smoking has become cultural in China. So even I think it must be stopped, but in recent years keeping the status in quo is somewhat acceptable. People must try to stop it and decrease this action. In the end, I manna to say that if anyone want him and his family to live longer and healthier, he just have to stop smoking in public places. Anyhow, smoking in public places is acceptable now; but it will disappear from china in the future.
