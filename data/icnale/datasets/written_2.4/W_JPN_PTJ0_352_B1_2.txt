I think it is very important for college students to have part-time job. This is because if they have not had part-time job by the time they entrance companies, they are probably confused than people who have had part-time job before. You can know how to work by having part-time job. Most of college students are employed by companies as soon as they graduate callege. So college students should have part-time job. Also, college students rarely meet people who not go to same college. This is the chance for college students to meet various people. For example, if you work in a supermarket, you will make friend with people who go to other college. You can make many friends like this. What is more, if you have part-time job, you can earn money. Almost all of college students do not have much money. And thier parents pay the money they use. They should be independent from thier parents some more and pay some money themselves. Having part-time job is the only way for college students to being independent from thier parents. By these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have part-time job.
