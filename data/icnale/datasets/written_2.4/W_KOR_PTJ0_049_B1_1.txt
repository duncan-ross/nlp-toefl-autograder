After graduating from high school and had hamburgers and pizza at the store part-time job. Most of the women responsible for the counter in the kitchen, but I was responsible for a burger. In the kitchen and everyone except me was the man. More responsible in charge of kitchen counter and helped me, but a lot of men. Working one month and earned 640, 000 won. But the money disappeared in less than one week. I'm making money as a gift to my parents and my grandfather gave to the allowance of 50, 000 won. Although little money, really pleased with my grandfather looked at me proud. For the rest of the money spent to buy my clothes. I will bring this summer, but is also part-time. I really like a cafe called peulyirago. I want to work there. Nice and bright personality, because I can do well might wonder. And I bet the boss is because it is precise and calculated. Again, the money earned will be gifts to the family. My dad is a part-time job, but I do not like haneungeot. I hope to concentrate on my studies. But I do not think so. I've learned many things, even if the first byte. Part-time in my life would be very helpful, I think.
