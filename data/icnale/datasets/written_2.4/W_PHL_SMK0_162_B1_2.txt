Smoking is the most popular bad habit of people nowadays. Advertisements about smoking which says that smoking is very dangerous to your health is everywhere and we can see them everyday but still people especially teenagers continue to smoke. Others say that smoking is cool; it is their way of relieving stress, and mostly influenced by others. Sometimes when friends want to talk to each other they stay in a place where they can eat, drink, talk at the same time, surf the net and smoke. This is why smoking in restaurants must be banned, because others who want to eat only and spend the time with their friends or family or considered the secondhand smokers breathe the same air that the smokers breathe. So once the smokers smoke the smoke that comes from the cigarette combines with the air we breathe so when other people breathe they can be classified as smokers too or worse cause smokers smoke with filters secondhand smokers inhale the smoke without filter. That's why smoking in restaurants must be banned cause instead of destroying the smoker's health only it destroys everyone's health in the restaurant. Smoking must ne banned not only in restaurants but also in public places where most of the people in a certain place stay, walk, meet etc.
