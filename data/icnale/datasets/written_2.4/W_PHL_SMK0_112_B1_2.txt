I Believe people have the right to smoke and do whatever they want. However, there is a limit to how far people can go when practicing their rights. I am an advocate of the J. S. Mill's Harm Principle that states people's actions should only be limited when they infringe on the rights of others. From this principle, I can firmly say that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. This ban should extend as far as public areas of restaurants go. It should still give leeway to prescribed isolated smoking areas that people consent to enter. Why do I believe in this? It is a known fact that second hand smoke from cigarettes and cigars have very detrimental effects on humans. If smoking was allowed in public areas like restaurants, people who do not consent to be exposed to such harm will be affected by the externalities smoking brings. In this scenario, we would be depriving the general public their right to breathe clean air and enjoy the food in their favorite restaurant. The only solution here is to remove the smoke, and this can only be done by banning the act of smoking in public areas.
