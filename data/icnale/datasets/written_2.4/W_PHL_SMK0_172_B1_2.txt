The number of tobacco smokers around the world is continuously and rapidly growing. It is extremely disturbing and dismaying. Currently, there are about 1. 1 billion smokers worldwide. At this rate, that number is expected to increase to about 1. 6 billion in 2015. Nevertheless, around 6 million people may die each year worldwide because of tobacco smoking and diseases related to it. How can one fathom in preventing these increasing figures to smoke in restaurants? A smoke-free dining is very ideal and delightful. Majority of the customers will feel comfortable in this kind of dining. But the smoke ban can greatly positively and/or negatively affect the food businesses. It all depends to the customer. People, mostly non-smokers usually lose their appetite when they sniffed a cigarette smoke nearby. The smell of cigarette smoke is not only displeasing but also unhealthy for a non-smoker and asthmatics. It is called secondhand smoke, which can cause various diseases worse than a smoker may get. However, smokers typically like their alcohols matched with cigarettes or smoke every after meals. It is a bad habit that is too hard to break. With these odds, most restaurant owners decided to make a smoking and non-smoking sections but alas, it is not always effective because smoke travels through the wind and can break through the barrier of these sections. The smoke ban will not only be beneficial for non-smokers but also to smokers as well. It will be discouraging smokers to light cigarette for a few hours in a day. It will help them cut down or even quit smoking. Regardless of how essential it may seem, smoke ban in all restaurants and food establishments is regrettably impossible and majority acknowledges that but unity can surely make the impossible possible. Therefore, is everyone ready for this mission?
