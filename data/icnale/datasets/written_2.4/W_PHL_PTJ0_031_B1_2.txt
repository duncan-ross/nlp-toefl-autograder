Studying for college after years of studying grade school and high school can be a monumental task for some. The less-fortunate may drop out of school or not even begin studying at all because of their financial difficulties. This creates all sorts of problems for society as more youth have no decent education. Some of the less-fortunate turn to part-time jobs as their way of alleviating their financial problems. They study while working to earn money just to pay their school dues.. One of the main reasons for a college student to have a part-time job is financial problems. Some college students have difficulty in paying their school dues and are forced to take on a part-time job; however, I still believe that they must not take on part-time jobs. There are scholarships available for less-fortunate yet deserving students. Some scholarships even give out stipends or allowances. A part-time job for a college student has advantages like, having financial support in their studies, job experience and knowledge; however it has its disadvantages like, less time for studying and more fatigue. College students should be concentrating on their studies, not on looking for ways to pay their tuition. Paying their tuition should be the job of the parents or guardians of the student. I believe that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it deprives them of their energy and time that should be allocated for their studies.
