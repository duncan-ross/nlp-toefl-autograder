Being a college student means you have to take some responsibilities. And most people consider it is necessary for college students to earn their school fees and ordinary life expanse. Therefore, many students in Taiwan have experiences of taking a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job not only helps student earn some money but also teaches them how to prepare for their career in the future. It is important for college students to have a part-time job because it has many benefits. A college student is almost regarded as a grownup, so they should walk away from the shelters of their parents. Actually most western students think they must take care of themselves after graduating from high school. Because in some case, a person who reaches at the age of being a college student has already had the basic ability to live in the society on himself. Besides, only when working for the expenditure of living will understand we cherish any little amounts of money. Although it is important to have a part-time job, some people still think it could influence school performance even make student flunk their some subjects. It is undeniable that some students in Taiwan encounter those situations. But I still think a mature college student can handle their schoolwork and jobs simultaneously.
