After entering the college, many students want to find a part-time job. As far as they are concerned, having a part-time job they not only can earn some money to pay their expense in the university, but can develop their ability to communicate with others. What's more, it is a good way to gain some society experience. There are also some people disagreeing with them. They think that as a university man we should make a good use of our time. Time should be used to gain more knowledge rather than to make money. Part-time job is totally a waste of time or compared with leaning it is inferior at least. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is of great significance to a university man who can benefit a lot from it. To start with, I would like to start with the question that what are the things that a university man should do. Is it just learning not participating any activity? I think everybody will say no. In the university, on the one hand we should acknowledge what we should learn from the books, on the other hand, we should how to become an independent person and how to enter the society. To many students, the part-time job may be the first job in their life. It is a start of an independent life. Then let's move on to some material gain. With the income that we gain from the part-time job, we can do something we like as well as pay our expense in university. I think it is a different feeling compared with that using the money asked from our parents. University is not only about knowledge, it is also important to gain some society experience. It is important to take a part-time job.
