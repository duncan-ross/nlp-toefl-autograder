I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. As I said before, I am very conscientious about my health and my fitness, and smoking has absolutely no place in my life because of its power to destroy the body. Another thing that many people don't know about is the ability of smoking to destroy the mind. Smokers can become very nervous and fidgety if they do not have their nicotine, and I think this makes them weaker as people. If the only time they can be very cool and collected is when they are smoking a cigarette, they have an enormous disadvantage as compared to people like me who consistently work to become naturally more focused and energetic. Japan has always struck me as a country where the people are very Zen, and so I would think that they're not particularly keen on tobacco use. But at the end of the day I don't really know. Therefore, if the Japanese people would like to be like me and would like to become more conscientious and better to their health, they should ban smoking at the restaurants in order to achieve this goal. If they can do that, they will take a step towards being more healthy as a country.
