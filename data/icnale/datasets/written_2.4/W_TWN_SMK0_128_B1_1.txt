I think I will completely agree in this topic that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In recently years, our law-making officials had made the law concerning people who want to smoke should not smoke in the public place passed, and at that time, some people were happy, some were not. Because the law may help some people escape from the second-hand smoking, but it also makes people smoking very inconvenient and shops selling smoking will lose some customers. Although there are something argued by the people want smoking, I believe the benefits will much better than bad. Because it maybe help some people who want to stop smoking make a determination to quit smoking, and maybe it can save more people from getting lung cancers. And just as the topic says it is necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants, because when we are having a meal, we are also enjoying the tastes and smelling, but if someone start to smoke, then the smoking fogging will be full of the space, and needless to say, it is hard for everyone. So I hope there will have more people to quit smoking.
