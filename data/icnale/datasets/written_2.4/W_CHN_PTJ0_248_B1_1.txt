 Nowadays, a problem that whether college students should take some part-time job has aroused people's concern. The view points vary from people to people. Someone think that taking the part time job will take up a lot of precious time which should be utilized for one's subjects. While others hold the opinion that part-time job does more good than harm. As far as I'm concerned, taking a part-time job will have a deeply influence on one's life. To begin with, salary strikes when it comes to job. As the tuition and price of commodities increase dramatically recently, it could indeed reduce our pressure from economics. In addition, compared with the substantial income, the acquired working experience deserves more attention. There is no denying the fact that the fast way to gain knowledge is read books. However, books from library may be outdated, giving you useless knowledge. Knowledge gained from experience may be firsthand, direct, and unforgettable. Everything is changing and so is knowledge. If you go out to make on-the-spot investigation, it is likely that you may be pleasantly surprised. Last but not the least, it is likely to make good friends, who will help you in your career after you graduate. Part-time job will broaden our circle of acquaintances. No amount of ordinary school-work or lessons can take place of friends acquired in the job. Since part-time job benefit us in many aspects, we had better put our schedule in good state, and make full use of a proper part-time job.
