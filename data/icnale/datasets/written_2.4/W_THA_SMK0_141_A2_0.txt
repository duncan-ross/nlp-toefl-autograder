I think that not agree smoking public places because it will interfere with other people and cigarette smell. When they are inhaled very dangerous to life, the smell of someone smoking is likely to life, the smell of someone smoking is likely to cause headaches. They should be pumped to where provided for those. Who want to fight smoking in public places are not good people looked at us as bad people do not have self- discipline may be other people that gossip. Indirectly harm other because not enough to hurt themselves to hurt anyone and if the smell when we inhale tobacco into a life threatening, such as newborn children could chock on the smell of cigarette smoke. Some people, just could not breathe and we feel that these dense cabinet a good way, we should not be smoking at all of our health is strong. When the smoke would have to pay more money to buy cigarettes. When we are install a lot more to lose money by when we went to sit and eat food where it should not smoke at all. It will negatively affect those around you. Some time offensive to people who are eating, standing, waiting for bus or other people. We should think of our minds heart. People may not like, smoking in time. People who smoke do not like that's not known. This happens a lot and everywhere. There should be law to smoke in public places. Most disturbing to others may not able to enjoy the smell of cigarettes.
