I do not think that it is of vital importance for college students to have a part time job, but having one would be rather beneficial for them. I feel that in the tertiary education of our lives now, the priority we should take up is to focus on learning in our educational institutions. Surely, having a part time job would compel us to become better at managing our time as we would then have to plan our schedules properly, and the additional allowance we get from working gives us more purchasing power for things we would like to enjoy. For the more financially fortunate, their aim of having a part time job might be more for the experience, and through part time positions such as being a waitress, they are able to learn to interact with people and manage situations, picking up advantageous social skills. Yet, if one turns out to fail at successful time management, the consequences would be severe, as the cost of undergoing college education is pretty much exponentially more than the pay a college student would receive from a part time job. Also, if one sees the life in a tertiary education not merely fixated on studies but also enjoyment, by taking up a part time job the student loses a part of his or her experience in college, which will never be found again once the student graduates, converse to a work experience that the student will be able to go through again upon graduation.
