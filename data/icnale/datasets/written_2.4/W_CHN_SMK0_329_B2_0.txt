 Smoking is a serious social problem in modern times. And it has been a widespread habit all over the world. It's a very serious problem because not only the old, the youth, but also middle school students have been engaged in smoking. A large amount of people, you know, die from smoking each year. Therefore, smoking is forbidden in some countries. However, some critics hold that it is not that necessary. They suggest it be allowed to smoke in public places. But in my opinion, smoking should be forbidden. As is known to all, smoking is greatly harmful to people's health, which, as several researches conducted in many countries has indicated, may cause lung cancer, heart disease and various respiratory illness. In the cigarettes hide something dangerous. Meanwhile, not only will smoking damage the health of the one who is smoking, but it will also do harm to other people around even further. Besides, forbidding smoking in public will give us back much fresher air. Meanwhile, smoking is totally a waste of money. In addition, careless smokers may cause dangerous fire, which will be a great problem to the society. To conclude, smoking is quite necessary to forbid in public.
