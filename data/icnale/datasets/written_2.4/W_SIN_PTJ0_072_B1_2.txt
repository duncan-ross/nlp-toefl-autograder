I do not agree with this statement. Firstly, the main role of students is to study. The most important thing for them is to do well in their academics and graduate with a good degree. It is not exactly necessary for them to have part-time jobs because this will only add burden to the students' workloads and might affect their academics. Of course, it might be good to have a part-time job to gain some working experience before stepping into the workplace. Nonetheless, this is not deemed to be extremely important or necessary. Secondly, I believe it is more important to develop themselves through CCAs and other extracurricular activities rather than part-time jobs. While the main point of a university education is to obtain a degree, it is not merely that. It is also important to explore new areas of interests and to participate in all sorts of activities because these are the last few years of being a student and opportunities to have fun will be sorely limited once we graduate. If students are not in desperate financial situation such that they have to find a part-time job to pay off their school fees, then I believe it would be better to enrich themselves via CCAs rather than part-time jobs. All in all, I feel that while a part-time job might be good to have, it is not extremely necessary or important.
