College students or university students should work part time. There are many reasons why they should look for part time jobs. First of all, they can help their parents reducing their living cost. Their needs, since they are still in college or university, are still being provided by the parents., by doing part time jobs, they can make their parents' expenses lighter. If college students are doing part time jobs, it means that they are earning additional money by themselves. The money they earned can be used as their pocket money. They do not have to ask for more money to the parents. Secondly, it can reduce the chance of misused spare time. College students tend to be free from their parents because they have already gone into a campus world. Beside money, they use their time based on their own minds. They may want to go out every weekend with friends or want to spend their time alone in the house or boarding house. However, working as a part timer can help them spend their time not only for entertainment such as clubbing and shopping, but for something that is very useful in life. Finally, the most important reason why college students should do part time jobs is because doing part time jobs can improve the students' personality. Since they are enrolled in certain colleges or universities, they still have to attend classes in the campus. if they really want to apply for part time jobs, they have to manage their time wisely. Thus, the students will learn how to organize themselves through schedules or plans in order to balance the campus life and the working world. Although it is still a part time job, they must obey regulations and rules given by the place where they work.
