To some extent, we can say that it is very important part time job are necessary in this sense that the education has become expensive now a day. The present scenario of our country has forced the people to earn more and more money. Our feces of education are touching to the skies, so it is very difficult for the people to survive in this situation. The problem for the student is that in the morning they usually attend there college and take classes, so in order to continue there education, they have to earn money. So part time job helps the student to pay there dues. Our people are facing so many problems. There energy crises, food crisis, financial problems, etc. in these circumstances people are unable to educate their children especially sons more and more. But they are helpless before there harsh circumstances. I think government is responsible in increasing the education dues day by day they should pay attention to this side seriously. If they do not think about it, they will have to pay it in a long run. There is another problem of the private colleges. There is a hell of different dues between government and private institutes. Private colleges are taking a big amount of fee. Mostly the rich people are taking admission in those colleges but the middle class people also take admission, then in order to continue their education they have to do a part time job. So the synopsis of the above discussion is that part time jobs are very important for students in order to continue there education.
