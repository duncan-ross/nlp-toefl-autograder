Education is the most important key to success. Quality education is a right and not a privilege. However, this right is not always granted to those who truly need it. To remedy this dilemma, students of the Philippines, rally to the Department of Education to negotiate with the department's chairperson a solution to benefit all. Quality Education is expensive, was the reply to the students.   There have been many great efforts to provide quality education for those who cannot afford it. The greatest effort (other than those of the parents ') made is that by the students themselves. They take it upon themselves to find jobs in order to finance their education and to meet the costs for their living. Students search high and low to find jobs, sacrificing their precious time and energy which could have been utilized to study for their upcoming exams or to finish their projects which could be due the next day. As exasperating as having to take on a part time job while studying for college is, it does have its importance. Not only does taking on a part time job help the student sustain him or her but it also teaches him or her responsibility. Through earning their own money, students learn the value of thriftiness. They learn to be more self-efficient. They also learn to appreciate all that they have and all that is given to them.   Having to juggle a part-time job and the difficulties of college may not be the most ideal life for the college student but it does not mean that it is all bad. Quality education is a right and not a privilege. But it does not mean we should just sit around waiting for it to come to us. Quality education is something we must work hard for.
