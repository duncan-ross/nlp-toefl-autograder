If smoking can be allowed in the restaurants, I will point out some disadvantages for banning it. For example, when talking about smoking, we can imagine about the pictures in hospital that showing about people who died by lung cancer. The main factor is from smoking and they are very suffered. Smoking kills many people in each year and it seems that the number of people is increasing year by year. Even the government is trying to promote the policy to reduce smokers in the country but it seems that the policy isn't really successful. Not only smokers will get hurt from smoking but many people who smell the smoke also got effect. The results in many studies shows that the people who smell the smoke from cigarettes is taking risk rather than the smokers. They can easily die rather than the person who smoke. It is very interesting that the smokers can live longer than the person who got only smell. So, if it is possible, the smoking could be controlled in an appropriate places. All people should help the government to make this happen in order to save the world and people lives. One possible resolution is having a sign on the restaurants to tell all kind of customer that this place is not allowed to smoke, so customers can see and ready to act.
