Smoker is everywhere in our word, in restaurants, in park, in some public places. As we know, smoking is harmful for our body, so these people who do not smoke refuse smokers smoke in public place such as some restaurants. So I think it is necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants over the country. Firstly, there are many harmful things in the cigarette that can damage physical functions, at the same time the smog is more harmful. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. People who don't smoke can also be affected if they sit next to smoker. Therefore, there is no doubt that smoking does harm to the health of both the smokers and nonsmokers. Second, cigarette end can cause fire accidents. And we have also seen the cigarette ends and the smog can pollute environment that affect our life. Third, smoking in public places is a kind of impolite behavior in our society. It may affect people work or studying. Finally, no smoking at all the restaurants will provide a better environment for people enjoy their lives. So I think people will get benefits from it. We need to ask our government to do something from now on for it.
