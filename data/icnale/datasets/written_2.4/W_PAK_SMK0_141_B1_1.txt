Smoking, primarily of tobacco, is an activity that is practiced by some 1. 1 billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population. Research has generated evidence that secondhand smoke causes the same problems as direct smoking, including lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung ailments such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. Specifically, meta-analyses show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who smoke in the home have a 20 to 30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who live with non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke in the workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16 to 19%. The concept of smoking is largely found in our restaurants which we adopted from western culture; that is so much bad habit; this habit not only damage the smoker's health but also effects those people who are sitting around them. The enemy can defeat the people of a country without firing a shot by making them to fall into drug-taking habits. we are also affected by this secret war of westerns by adopting this habit as a fashion in our hotels and restaurants which develops bad habits in our adults. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans favored a complete ban inside of restaurants, 34% favored a ban in all hotel rooms, and 29% favored a ban inside of bars. Another Gallup poll, of over 26, 500 Europeans, conducted in December 2008, found that "a majority of EU citizens support smoke-free public places, such as offices, restaurants and bars. As we can see from above that the western country's public are completely in favored to banned smoking from restaurants, as it is our public should also mustly participates in smoking-ban activities and mustly co-operate with governments to end this bad activity from our restaurants. It is the high time that government of Pakistan arranged a total prohibition of (ban on) taking-smoking in our restaurants with the co-operation of all countries. At least in this field, there is international agreement.
