The pros of banning smoking especially at restaurants in Japan far outweigh any temporary dissatisfaction that may be felt by the smokers who feel that they are being persecuted for their lifestyle. To begin with, smoking is in every way a very dirty habit. Not only does it make the homes, clothes, and possessions of smokers forever tainted by that terrible smell, it also increases litter and trash on the streets. For some reason, smokers seem to think that it is okay to throw cigarette butts anywhere they feel like, and nothing makes a street look more dirty or poor than thousands of cigarettes strewn about. Furthermore, I hope that smoking will become banned at more than just restaurants but in all public places. At the same time, I think it is only fair to provide the smokers with a place to smoke, so I think designated places should be established. However, many cities and governments are not willing to expend the effort or the funds that would be necessary to accomplish such a feat, and if this is true for the Japanese, it may be a long time before smoking is banned at restaurants. Therefore, nonsmokers will have to be patient while the gears of government slowly grind and the red tape and slowly unravels.
