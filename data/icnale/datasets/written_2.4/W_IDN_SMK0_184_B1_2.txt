I agree with the statement smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. Why do i agree with this statement?. There are many reason why do I agree with this. As we know restaurant is a place to eat and there are many people come to restaurant to have lunch, dinner, or breakfast. Not only for one person. Smoking in the restaurant will disturb other people around the smoker. The people will not enjoy the food because they smell a smoke. A delicious food will be undelicious food because they are disturbed with the smoke. Beside that smoke make the restaurant room will not fresh and always smell smoke. Although the owner or waiters give fresh spray to the room, the smell of smoke still stay in the room. It will make the consumer who do not like smoking will lazy to come to the restaurant. Last reason is the effect of the smoke from the smoker. As we know smoke from smoker will give effect for people around the smoker not only for the smoker. Or we call passive smoker and active smoker. Passive smoker is a victim from active smoker. The effect from smoker is lung diseases, asthma, and cancer. So, if smoking still allow in all restaurant in the country I very disagree. It mean I agree with that statement.
