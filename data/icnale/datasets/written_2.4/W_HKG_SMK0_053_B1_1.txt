The issue of banning smoking in all restaurants is one of the hardest topic need to solve in the whole world. For those who are not smoking always argued that we must ban smoking in all restaurants. One of the most important reasons is secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemical which are known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. All of them are common diseases and kill a lot of people in the world. They said that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke and it must be ban. However, there are some voices came out and argue that smoking cannot banned in all restaurant, like restaurant manager. They are afraid that it would hurt business and it is difficult to control. They think that if there is no smoking allowed, some smoking customers may not come to the restaurant again. Moreover, there are many arguments occur when the restaurant waiters try to dissuade a customer not to smoke. The restaurant waiters do not want to be hard to the customer even if they have the right to stop the smoking customers. They do not want to hurt the relationship between the restaurant and the customers. In my point of view, I agree banning smoking in all restaurants. In addition to the secondhand smoke, smoking has no advantages and what I am try to say is even banning smoking in all restaurant is not about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with.
