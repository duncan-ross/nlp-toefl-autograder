Students in university sometimes have a part-time job, they do this because of certain motives; they want to get a money to pay their tuition, just for fun because they don't like to study, or do part-time because of influence from their friends. Part–time job certainly affects the students' performance in the class by making them cannot concentrate in the class, sleepy, and tired. Most of students do part-time job because they want to get extra money to pay for their expenses in university. As a consequence, they spend more time to work, means, less time to study. In addition, part-time job usually requires students to work physically. Human body is not a robot, it has a limit, so, after a day of part-time, they will feel tired and use the time in class to sleep, even if they are not sleeping in class, they will follow the subject painfully. As a result, they get nothing from the class. It is good if students can control themselves to do the part-time. But, usually when deal with money, students will sacrifice more time to get more money. So, I think it is not good to have part-time job while studying in university. For the financial problem, it is better to ask for financial help from university, so students can concentrate more in their study, and have a better future.
