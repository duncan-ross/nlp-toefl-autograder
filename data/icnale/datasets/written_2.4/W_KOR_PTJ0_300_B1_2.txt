In Korea, college students have a hight level of dependence on their parents about economical matters, and responsibilities of parents for their children also continue until the college education. Even many parents should pay the college tuition. Although there are many diffrent considerations, I believe that the college students should have a part time job because of several reasons. First of all, the college students have accountability to make their own spending money. I know they can not economic independence completly in college, but they can fully make money for small expense by themselves. For example, a regular income from the part time job will come in useful to you when you want to buy dresses, cosmetics, books and refreshments, etc. Next, the part time job gives you the chance when you want to experience your future job. For example, if you hope to be a curator when you graduate from college, the part time job in a gallery will be helpul to your job. It will be a career just not the part time job. In the last thing, the part time job is a good way of learning valuable social skills. In my case, I often felt difficult to meet and talk many random people, so I decided to get a part time job in sales. Later, I finally overcame my problems as meeting people in a shop. To summarize, I think accumulating a variety of experience through the part time job helps you in whatever you choose to do later in life. Therefore having part time job will be important process to collge studen
