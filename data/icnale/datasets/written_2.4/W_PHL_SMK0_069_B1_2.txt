n my opinion, yes it should be banned in the restaurants because no one wants to smell the cigar smoke while eating, I 'm a smoker myself but I see to it that whenever I 'm in a public place like the restaurants I avoid smoking, because not all people are smokers and not all people like the sight and the smell of people smoking near them specially while eating and also I 'm a strong believer that second-hand smoking is far more dangerous than smoking it by yourself because at least when you are smoking there is a filter that can lessen the toxins that enter your body but if you're a second hand smoker then you don't have any filter that can block the toxins that you smell in the cigars. I may have my right and I do have the right to smoke if I want to, but my right ends when the right of others begin, so I 'm really into the banning of smokers in the restaurants, maybe then restaurant manager can designate a smoking area for the smokers a little too far from the people who are not smoking. It will be a great idea if all the restaurants will have a special-place for the smokers.
