In many countries, smoking is bad behavior, if who smokes a cigarette then he will be looked badly because smoking can kill a person who smokes it and also it can kill people who stand around smoker. So, there are many groups anti smoking in any places. Currently, smoking will be banned completely at the restaurant in the country for many reasons. For example, if smoking is allowed in the restaurant, it can cause some disease and the image of the restaurant will be bad. So, many groups of people will be fight for their personal and public rights. In my personal opinion, I strongly agree I think that it is true to do that because the restaurant is the place that many people go there for fantastic food, romantic dinner and finally the restaurants can make the customers happy. Sometimes there are babies, children, and pregnant women in restaurants; smoking will be bad for them because it can damage their health. In addition, if the restaurants there are people that smoke cigarette, it will be looked that it is dirty place. It is not attractive placed. Also, if someone is smoking in the restaurants, it can make the air bad then it will destroy the customer's health. So, I reason that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country exactly.
