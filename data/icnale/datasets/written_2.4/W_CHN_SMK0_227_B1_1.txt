I consider that smoking in the public is having a worse and worse influence on the society. Although cigarettes help a lot on the economy of a country, I still suggest that it must be banned in public. Many people around us have developed the habit of smoking and some of them are even addictted to it. However, as is known to all, smoking influences ones' health, and always smoking is just like killing themselves. People who smoke are more possibly to get a cancer and some related diseases. So, for the sake of one's family, people should learn to quit smoking right now. Moreover, the tobacco will produce lots of harmful and poisonous smoke. The gas has an unpleasant smell and make people feel unwell. There is no denying that the inhalation of second-hand smoke is harmful to people health. Furthermore, environment will be affected by the smoke realeased by cigarettes. The air quality in the city would decline. You can always find that many cigarettes ends was thrown on the streets. It was not good for the development of the city. In a word, smoking in the public may meet the needs of some people, but it has many disadvantages to the whole city. People should consciously do not smoke.
