As an undergraduate student, I strongly agree that it is Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking in inner place will impact someone who hates the smell of smoke. Smoker may pronounce that it is their right to smoke; however, it would ruin other people's right. Second, as everyone knows, smoking will damage your health. Second-hand smoke will be even more harmful. You may not care about your own body and think that it is nothing, I just want to do what I want, but I think it is just show your unrespect to your body. Of course, your free to do thing like that, nevertheless, you can not bother other person who does not want to be like you. Taking me for example, I am afraid of the deceases which caused by the second-hand smoke like cancers and tumors. Males' sperm would become ill and females would become sterile. That's just horrible. Third, a burning cigarette may cause serious disaster. For example, many fire accidents were caused by the cigarettes which was not be put off completely. Many restaurants are decorated by very beautiful carpet and cloth which are tend to catching on fire. In short, I firmly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
