Life is quiet difficult for some people, financial problem is always a hindrance to their needs and happiness in life. Part time job is the answer to their problems, having a part time job while studying is a big help to their financial needs especially in their school fees. Even though it is only a part time job it is has a big part in the life of the person. I used to have a part time job for 8 months; it is difficult to study while working. You have to manage your time well for you to be more productive both in school and work. It is not that easy for a working student to focus on their studies, you have to sacrifice many things like joining or attending activities in your college because instead of going to the activity you will just used your time to work. Another thing is having fun with your friends and classmates, as a student it is normal to have parties and other gatherings with your friends but it's not the thing with the working students, they have to missed things like that. It's hard to have a social life when you're working, schedules are very tight or if you have time you will just decide to have a rest or do things that needs to be done. Part time job is a good experience if you can manage things around you but if not it will be the other thing around. You can learn good things from it and it will be a lifelong lessons that you can use in the future.
