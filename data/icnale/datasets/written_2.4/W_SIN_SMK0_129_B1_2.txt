I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking has no benefits at all while having many disadvantages. Smoking has detrimental effects on a person's health. Smoking contains harmful substances which break down the lining of our lungs, cause the production of mucus which blocks the airways and cause one to become addicted to smoking. Visible effects of these harmful substances include blackened teeth, shortage of breath, black fingernails and getting tired more easily. Furthermore, smoking not only affects the smokers themselves but also passive smokers. These passive smokers are passer-bys who inhale the smoke given out from smokers and do suffer the same consequences of smokers themselves, albeit to a lesser extent. Completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is a step in the right direction to discourage people from smoking. A substantial population frequent restaurants and banning smoking in these places may be a strong push for smokers to quit smoking as they may find that being able to enter the restaurant may be greater than the pleasures they get from smoking. Moreover, with no smokers in restaurants, other patrons of these places do not need to suffer from the passive smoke. This benefits all parties going to the restaurants and improves the health and living environments of the population in general.
