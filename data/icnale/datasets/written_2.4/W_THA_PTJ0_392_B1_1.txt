Sons and daughter s have to focus on studying. But many college students are going to find a part time job to do now. It isn't important thing for them. They should empathize their studying. If they work for part time job, they maybe no time to read book. Most of part time job is limited; they have to do at least 6 hours per day. Actually, the college students have learnt for 3 hours a day. So they don't have enough time to prepare or review their daily lesson. It's OK if you don't review it regularity but for Mid-term test or final test. You must have time for reviewing. If some college students do part time job, surely they must be tired from their working and they can not attend the class in the morning.
