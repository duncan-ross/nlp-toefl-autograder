College is indeed more expensive than high school in terms of expenses. It is not always the case that all students can afford all the expenses, especially for Filipino families. Their parents may support them somehow but not all parents can. Some might not even have parents to support them. And some students are faced to be the only hope of the family to leave the poverty. Not all of us are lucky enough to be born from a rich family. Since college students are still on the process of getting their degrees and professional titles, they could only be qualified to apply on part-time jobs. Therefore, students, who really wants to pursue their education with insufficient money, take part-time job a major source of income. College inccures a lot of expensess, from tuition fee and books to projects and requirements, which requires giving off money. Some students are even self-supported. And in their case, they have to get all the possible opportunities to earn money in order to support themselves. Some students apply as Student Assistant(SA), like here in Adamson University, where the school pays half of the tuition fee in return of working part-time for them. Other part-time jobs may be in fast-food chains, mall, modelling, or if you're talented enough to apply as a singer on coffee shops or somewhere related. Part-time jobs are usually taken seriously by those from public colleges or private universities who happens to be unfortunate financially.
