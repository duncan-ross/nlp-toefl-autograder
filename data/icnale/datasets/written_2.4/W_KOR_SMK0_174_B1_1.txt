I perfectly agree this topic to respect all people who are in restaurants. I have been suffered this bad problem from smoking when I eat out with my family at restaurants. Everywhere I go, there were many people who make me angry. It can be expanded the meaning scale of place in which it is called public place. Now, public places are created around us. I went to the park near my boarding house when I have a time to play badminton with friends for health. At there, I played just about few minutes because a person smokes close to us. That stimulates my nose and can't play more. Also, I played basketball after the school in next to the play ground. At there, my friend smokes. In a sudden near me a person who talks with another said Please, stop smoking while resting. In this reason my friend said I'm really sorry that I will stop it right away. Like this instances, just one or two, so many non-smokers can be pain with breathing when they go there. Just think about it what you cause. Smokers should know if they are no smoking but who smokes in the public place besides you or your family. If so, you must be anger that because of the bad smell. So I strongly insist that smokers go out and smoke where be notified to smokers.
