Have you ever seen people who smoke in the restaurant? Most people in Korea do not like a person who smokes in the restaurants, so smoking has been banned in most of Korean restaurants. However, there are still some restaurants where people are allowed to smoke. In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in this country. The reasons are below. First, other people in the restaurants can feel uncomfortable because of its smell. The smell of tobacco is not good to everybody who is in the restaurant, so some people can feel unpleasant. If you make other people uncomfortable, it is not a good manner. So, you have to stop smoking in the restaurant not to bother other people due to its smell. Secondly, smoking is not good for people who are in the restaurants. If there are some people in a restaurant, smoking can influence other people's health. None of them want to make their body unhealthy due to your smoking. Especially, if there are some women who get pregnant. Smoking may be serious health problems to them. For these two reasons, I think that smoking in the restaurants should be banned. If smoking is banned at all restaurants in Korea, we will be able to enjoy the dish more at the restaurants.
