I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants due to the following reasons. Firstly, smoking is not just harmful to smokers, but also to other people because of second-hand smoke. If someone in a restaurant smokes, all the customers of the restaurant may be forced to breathe in the second-hand smoke. There are numerous people inside a restaurant so the harming effect of the second-hand smoke can be serious. Also, a restaurant without smoke usually gives a better impression to the customers, including tourists. If smoking is not completely prohibited at all restuarant, tourists may dislike eating in those places, affecting their impression to the restaurant, or even the city being visited. After they have shared their experience in travelling that city, there will be less people willing to travel to that place. This greatly decreases the revenue in both tourism and catering services of the city. Some people may argue that restaurants will suffer a loss if smoking is banned because they loss a large number of customers who like smoking. However, on the contrary, restaurants can attract many people who dislike eating with any second-hand smoke. Therefore, it is also possible that a restaurant can earn more after banning smoking, making the change in revenue remains indeterminate. Smokers can enjoy smoking, but they should also take the health and feeling of other people into consideration when they smoke. I do not think that a restaurant is a suitable place to smoke since many people will be affected, so smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
