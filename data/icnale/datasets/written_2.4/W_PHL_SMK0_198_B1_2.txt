As a student of Adamson University and a citizen of this country, the Philippines, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, because, first, as people said smoking is bad for our health and it shortens our life span it extremely hits our lungs and it may lead to lung cancer or directly to death, second, It only not affects the smoker but also other people who are inhaling the smoke they are called second smokers, it harms their health especially the lungs also they can occur illness like asthma etc. Smoking should be banned in restaurants because it is a public place and there are many people in their, especially they are eating and it also affects the food. It may obtain a small amount of nicotine in a given food. Not in just restaurants but also in public places like mall, sari sari store and other places that consider public. My opinion for the smokers is if you are a smoker now, I am telling you to stop it and stop it at once because it may be a reason for your death and also a cause of air pollution. Instead you are smoking, you should help our environment.
