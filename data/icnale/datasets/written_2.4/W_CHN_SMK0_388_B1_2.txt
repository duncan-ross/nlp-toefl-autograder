It is of great significance that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When I was young, I was taught with a picture that lungs were covered with soot. The statement that smoking is harmful to our physical health has been deeply rooted in my mind since then. There are many poisonous elements such as nicotine in a cigarette, and when it burns, it may produce carbon monoxide. Now, when more and more people of my age start to smoke and persuade me to smoke, I just smile and refuse. However, there are also some advantages of smoking regardless of the side effects. Smoking can help one to calm down when facing difficult situations. A famous example is the detective Sherlock Holmes, he always hold a pipe in his mouth while thinking about the case. In public places such as restaurant, however, despite the advantages, smoking should be banned furthermore. To some people, they do not like smoking, and they will absorb poisonous smoke passively and unwillingly if someone smokes at restaurant. To pregnant women, smoke is even more harmful. Since not all smoke, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
