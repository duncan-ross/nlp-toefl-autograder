Today, many college students have a part time job. Because they need a money for their allowance and so on. Above all, they work for their expensive school fees. Likewise I have been worked part time job for 4years. I get a lot of social experience and met many various people through that. Also I felt delight and despair during working. That experience and feeling will be the part of my growth. Then, is it important for college students to have a part time job? I think that case by case. Because I feel that Korea part time job's environment is very bad. The first reason is that pay is very low. Many people can't receive their minimum wages. Me too. This is not fair obviously. And the second reason is bad employer. They often ask to the student employee sexual claim delicately. So employee can't send employer to police. Though I can't see them, I am very displeasure. Of course every employer isn't bad. Also student employees can get a many valuable things. Selection is they'. I hope that they get a good experience through part time jobs. And I wish that part-time job's environment is improves better than now.
