Whether are not smoking should be banned at Japanese restaurants should be decided by the people who it affects most, the Japanese. Nonetheless, I feel that I can offer some perspectives on the situation which may not already have been brought up. I am sure that everyone else is writing about how smoking is bad for people and how it is rude to these people and the restaurants staff to smoke at restaurants. What some people may have not considered, however, is that when it comes to the end of the day, many smokers are really not in control of their smoking habit. This is to say that nicotine is so addictive that these people literally cannot control their behavior. There is also a strong emotional connection to having something in the mouth, which comes from our time as babies. This is why so many smokers are successful in quitting by chewing gum, using toothpicks, or chewing sunflower seeds. All of these can serve as good replacements for the feeling of having something in your mouth, and so I feel that more than banning smoking in restaurants, there should be more opportunities for smokers to quit smoking effectively. This solution stands to solve the entire problem of smoking and not only the problem of the nuisance in restaurants.
