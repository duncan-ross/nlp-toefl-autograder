I feel that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. The most important reason is that smoking is harmful and there is no advantage of smoking. Not only does smoking cause health problems, breathing in second-hand smoke is much more harmful than the smoke originally from the cigarettes. Not only does smoking in restaurants affect the other patrons who are there to enjoy their meals, it may also cause their meals to be unpleasant. To non-smokers, the smoke is smelly and may cause their clothes and personal items to absorb the smell of the smoke. I feel that having a meal at a restaurant should be an enjoyable one and it is an opportunity for people who are stressed to relax and have a good meal. By banning smoking at all restaurants in the country, it creates a pleasant place for people to enjoy their meals with their friends and family. The dining atmosphere could be severely affected if there is a patron who is seated behind you and smoking at the same time. In addition, if someone with medical history asthma inhales the smoke, it may cause an asthma attack and the consequences could be disastrous. Thus I feel that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country because it is harmful to breathe in second-hand smoke and it creates an unpleasant dining experience at the restaurant.
