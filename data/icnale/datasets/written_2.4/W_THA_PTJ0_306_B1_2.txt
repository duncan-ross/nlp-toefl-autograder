I think the past-time job that it is important for college student because nowadays situation in Thailand is not stable because conflict of the government and about colour group, so it has change many things. Economic at the moment that make decrease salary of people in Thailand so some students must find part-time job for they will get some money, help family, and increase income within family of them. Some student have to working hard for they do not have the parents that will give some money to him. Therefore, they must work for tending themselve. Some students must do part-time job because the parent of them have low incom and not enough for buy or pay something in each month that make them must do this for being curtail the problem of families and take some money for them's life in each day. Especially, working the past-time job will make them get new experience and use it in the future of them. Lastly. I want to say if your parents have enough money for take you into the college so you should pay attention the best in class and for the future of you and you will get a good job. Moreover, your parents will proud that you can graduated from anywhere.
