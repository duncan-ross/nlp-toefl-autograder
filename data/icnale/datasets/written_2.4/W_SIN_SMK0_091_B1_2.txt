Public smoking is becoming an issue that is widely discussed at all levels. This is because of the higher awareness of the negative impacts of smoking including damages to personal and other people's health, high cost of cigarette, large restriction of smoking areas that made smoking inconvenient and sometimes, social isolation. As far as smoking in restaurant is concerned, it should be completely banned primarily due to health concerns, regardless of whether the restaurant is in an air-conditioned environment or an open Al Fresco concept. Although smoking areas have been demarcated to allow smoking activities in some dining areas, the fact that air circulates will transport the toxic smoke particles to non-smoking area as well, thereby causing irritation to other diners. It is proven scientifically that inhaling second hand smoke is much more dangerous that the actual smoking itself. Besides that, there is also the third hand smoking, which refers to smoke particles sticking on clothes, or food, which eventually gets into a person's digestive or respiratory system. Another reason why smoking in restaurant should be banned is that it will affect other diners' dining experience. Smell is an important factor that affects the enjoyment of food. If the cigarette smell is so strong, it not only covers the natural aroma of the food, but also adds on to unpleasant cigarette stench that can possibly turn away customers. It is therefore important to ban smoking completely in all dining areas, especially in restaurants where consumers pay a higher price for better dining experience. This is the only way to do justice to non-smokers as they reserve the rights to enjoy clean air.
