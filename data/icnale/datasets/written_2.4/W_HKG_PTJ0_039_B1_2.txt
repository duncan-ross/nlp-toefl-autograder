I think there is no definite answer because it depends on different situations. The purpose of doing a part-time job and two groups of students with diverse economic backgrounds will be discussed as follows. To most of the students, doing Part-time job is a means of earning live expenses or tuition fee during each semester. The high university's tuition fee is not affordable for the poor students. They have to spend extra time to work for money in order to reduce the economic pressure of their family. In contrast, those wealthy students are not worried about the expenses. The most important thing in their mind is to broaden their social network by joining different gatherings or concentrate on their studies. Some may argue that there are different financial assistance schemes provided by the Government for the tertiary students. For example, the Non-means-tested Loan Scheme and the Student Travel Subsidy. Those aimed to help the students to meet their tuition fees and basic living expenses. Besides, there are lots of different types of scholarship from the university and the Government for the students to apply. However, the borrowers have to pay back the loan after the graduation and it is noted that scholarships are awarded to the outstanding student only. Therefore, it is understandable that the poor one have to do a part-time job. Besides, some may say that working experience is necessary for future career, so it is better for the university students to have part-time job. However, the working experience could be gained from the summer job or internship program during summer or winter holiday. During the study period, I think the most crucial affair for a student is to concentrate on enhancing the academic performance and personal soft skills rather than being enslaved to money except the one who is really in poverty.
