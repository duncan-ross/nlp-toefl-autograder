We have debate in the class about Should Government Ban Smoking In The Restaurant. I as the person who contra or disagree about intervention of the government to ban smoking in the restaurant. Actually the majority of people know about the dangerous of smoke and they know what is the best and worst for them, however the majority of them are smoker. I think if the government want to reduce the smoker can use other ways such as give elucidation and more information about cigarette or ban smoking in the hospital, etc. As we know that restaurant have management that manage it in order. I am sure that each management in each restaurant will give the best for their restaurant. When the government ban smoking in the restaurant, the management of the restaurant will have difficulties to get a lot of guest and because of this the restaurants will bankrupt because they have no income for manage and regulate the restaurant. Furthermore, it will increase a mount of jobless that made a new problem for government. I assume that the management of restaurants will give the best for their guest in order to they feel comfortable and convenience with their serve both of the smoker or passive smoker, such as provide a room of smoking area for the smoker. The guest who have behavior to smoke after eating will be enjoyable because they have special place to do it without disturb other people. In conclusion the government should not ban smoking in the restaurants because restaurants have management that can manage and give the best for the guest. Other options for the government to decrease that bad effect of smoke are give more information to public and ban in some important place such as hospital.
