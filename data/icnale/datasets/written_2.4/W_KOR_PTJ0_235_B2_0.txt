I don't think that having a part time job is important for college students. It would be good to live economically independent from their parents. However, as a status of a student, there are a lot of things, especially related to studies, for students to do. For some students, it is hard to live by the money from parents give, they manage to earn money by doing a part time job. It is understandable, and for me, I also do a part time job, but I sometimes find it hard to manage both studying and working at the same time. I cannot fully concentrate on my studies because of my part time schedules. The best way is to get a scholarship with good grades. Then, it could help my tuition fee, but I still need enough money to live on my every day life. There's saying, For the young, it is grateful to have a hardship. In the early 20s struggles may help us grow up and be mature relatively. However, there are so many struggles not only in 20s but also for one's whole life, so the old adage doesn't apply to these days anymore. By doing a part time job, one may learn how to make a harmony with others in workplaces, and find what kind of jobs one prefers. Let's look into what kinds of part time jobs college students these days work for. Few of them have part time jobs which they eager to do, considering their future career, as I believe. Most of them work as private tutors, probably it is the fortunate case, cashiers, servers A part time job doesn't mean anything but the quick way of making handy money. Therefore, I don't think it is not that valuable for students to have a part time job.
