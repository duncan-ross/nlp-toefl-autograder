As college students, our primary role is to complete our course in the institution, for purpose of education and for purpose of the certificate. These are essential for us to move on to the later stage of life which entails living and working. If we consider our ultimate goal from college to be to get the qualifications for a future job, there are two perspectives to explore the questions. One, we have to excel in what we do and be focused in our role of learning, so that we can get the qualifications required and know it well. That is to say, we should not have a part-time job while studying for it might distract us from our goal. However, on the other hand, having a part-time job would give us work experience and this is something that are not taught in the textbooks or lectures. Hence, the part-time job is as essential as the learnings from class in preparing us for our goal. Of course, there are no hard and fast rules about the question, and surely there are its pros and cons. If a student has excellent time management, and a part-time job would be beneficial to him, why not? If he is cash strapped and has to hold a part-time job to finance his study, it is also reasonable to have the part-time job. For some students, they may not have the need to do part-time jobs, because they put other priorities like sports, or school commitments and if their family financial ability allows, it might be better to spend their time on other activities, because the benefits they derive might be more than what they get from working. Hence it varies across individuals and it depends on their needs and wants.
