Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? In my opinion I think it is important for some of students who is quite a poor or be lack of money. They need money that can solve their problems because nowadays money is very important in daily life, so they must do the part-time job. That is the way to help get money. This case show us the importance of part-time job for the poor student. For the wealthy student I think it may important or not for them because they can do it if they want or not if they do not want to do, money is not important for wealthy man. Doing part-time job is one way to get the social experience. You might meet new friends, maybe good or maybe bad. You will have a good training such as leaning to be patient with many bad situations or trying to be optimistic with something that you can not stand. Even though you are the wealthy man or you are very rich but money can not buy you everything you want. You need to find something you want like the experience by yourself.
