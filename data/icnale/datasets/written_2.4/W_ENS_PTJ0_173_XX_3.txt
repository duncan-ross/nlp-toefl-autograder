I agree because it teaches students to take on more responsibility, gives them some extra income and allows them to get some very real work experience. It is important that students learn that they have to earn sooner or later and I think that having a part-time job gives them the perfect introduction as to what life will really be like when they enter their new jobs on a full-time basis. If I were in college, I would be getting as many part-time jobs that I could squeeze in, because I want to have many different experiences. So, when and if I travel, I have more than one set of skills that I can fall back on if I need to get some type of job while I'm away. I guess it can't be easy though, because with all the study and all and loads of other students also looking for part-time jobs, it must get frustrating for them sometimes. Then again though, if they experience a lot of problems at college, then they get better at dealing with them which have got to help them later in life. I mean, because they have faced some challenges, then they get better at dealing with them and stronger mentally.
