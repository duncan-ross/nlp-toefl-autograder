The idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country is good for health and environment but it is nearly impossible because nowadays smoking is one of a life style especially in Indonesia. It's true that some restaurants already have banned smoking at their place, the restaurants who done that must be the elite one, so the customer won't have problem if they don't smoking, but for the middle and low economical restaurant, they will lose some customer if they banned smoking in their place. Even though I am not a smoker but I know some reasons why smoking is very important to them. Some of them said that having conversation while smoking make them more enjoy, open minded and think clearly, and they usually do that at restaurant. Another reason is because smoking after eating makes some special pleasure for them which also take place at restaurant. It's funny actually to believe that kind of excuse but some research say that the chemical things inside cigarette make the smoker tense more relax and stabiles their mind, another experts say that smoking can make angry people to relax and think more clearly. We all know but smoking is a bad habit and dangerous not only the smoker but people around them, but since it is a life style now, it is nearly impossible to rid all of them instantly. So, the all the restaurants should prepare some smoking area for them. Some restaurants already applied that, for example at airport lounge, and many else, most of them run it successfully.
