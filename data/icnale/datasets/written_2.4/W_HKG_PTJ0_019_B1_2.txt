Nowadays there is a heated discussion among the public about whether university students should take part-time jobs. Someone are for it, while others claim that it is a waste of time. From my point of view, I agree with the idea that part-time jobs is important for university students. First and foremost, part-time job provides university students with a good opportunity to apply what they have learnt from classes to the reality. It is widely acknowledged that the final goal of education is to solve practical problems. Therefore, none of us can ignore the importance of the precious experience brought by part-time jobs. Furthermore, taking part-time job can help build our social network in advance. Being in this society with so fierce competition today, network is becoming increasingly significant. So building a network before stepping into the real society will bring much more advantages without any doubt. However, there exists a problem about part-time jobs that cannot be solved temporarily. It indeed cost a lot of time and energy. What's more, the part-time job we take is seldom consistent with other major program in university. All in all, the advantages of part-time job overweight its disadvantages. As a consequence, I restate my opinion that it is a wise chose for university students to take part-time jobs.
