Part-time work can play an important role in the development of any up and coming person and can play an especially important role in the development of the average college student. If there is one thing I have learned from sociology, it's that children on average are not inherently motivated to do things that are difficult or can induced stress or pain. This is also a basic concept of psychology. Therefore, I think it is necessary to sometimes give younger people a gentle push in beneficial directions. This is to say that even if an 18 or 19 your old new college student is ready or not for work, they may stand to gain by finding part-time work. Ironically, the people who for whom this will be most beneficial are the people that are least ready to work. These people have a lot of growing up to do, and they have a lot to learn about responsibility and the value of a dollar. The other side of students who are already mature enough to want to work on their own may pursue more advanced positions such as internships or other opportunities which will directly benefit their major and future career. Clearly, having a part-time job has a variety of benefits which are different for different people.
