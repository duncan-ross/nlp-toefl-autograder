Many college students have part-time jobs, so do I. Though according some people, most of them from Asia parents, they disagree with it. A lot of Asia parents think their children only need to do is study, having part-time jobs is waste of time. In my opinions: as a person, if we have chance to study, we should try our best to get it, but I also think having a part-time job as important as studying. There are some reasons: First, Not all the knowledge from the books, in the reality, most of knowledge from our life and this world. Having a part-time job can help us to know more things than studying. Second, if you didn't move your body at a long time just sit and read or write, you may have the health problems. Doing some part-time jobs like answering the phones, delivering the flys will make you sweat a lot and move your body. Third, having a part-time job make you must to learn how to manage your time. How to balance studying and part-time job need your wise. If you don't have a good plan, your life would be a mess. Make a long story in short; I think as a student it's important to have a part-time job. Although, not all the part-time jobs are good, we still can use our wise choosing the better one and learning from it. At all, studying can't give us everything, having a part-time job is one of ways to realize this world.
