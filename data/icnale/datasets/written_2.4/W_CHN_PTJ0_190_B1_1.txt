There is no doubt that more and more university students look for part-time jobs. However, people argue whether it's beneficial to our college students. In my view, there are more advantages for college students than disadvantages. My reasons are as follows. First of all, it's an opportunity to strengthen our ability. As we all know, now competition becomes heavier and heavier in our society. We should be equipped with knowledge and training skills. And part-time job can give us more practical knowledge. In addition, if we only study unless we study, we may be shifted out by our society. Nevertheless, you can experience what you can't learn during your academic pursuit when you take part in part-time jobs. What's more, the skills you acquire through taking part-time jobs will benefit you even more your future career though now you think it's useless. In university, we have much spare time and feel very bored. Sometimes, we may lose ourselves. So we can make full use of time to take a part-time job. I believe you feel useful and happy. Last, we can earn money from part-time. We can help our family by this. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Try to have one if you have time.
