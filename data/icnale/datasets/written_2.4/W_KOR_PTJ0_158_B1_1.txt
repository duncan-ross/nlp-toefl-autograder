I think that Korean part time job culture should be changed. Because, the minimum wage system of our country is due to be very lower than the other country. In addition, it is very low the service of them. In the case of the near country Japan, the service is good with the compensation for the part time jobs. So, in our country, the opinion about the part time job and thought has to be changed. There will be lots of the person work the part-time job among the college students in our country. In addition, the high school students experience many part time job experiences. However, there will be more lots of the effect that the idea after their experiences is bad than the good Positive Impacts. This shows the present condition of the part time job of our country. Therefore, the government in our country has to enhance the part time job improving of environment and minimum wage. In this way, the part time job culture of our country develops only when installing. It will be equal with the part time job culture including the other America or Japan, and so on. This is sure to when being the technical goal of the invention to install, and then it is the intractable problem. The we, moreover, it has to be the awareness about the part time job good and the more developmental method has to be thought.
