I think that taking part time job is very good. Because we learn correct manner and words to the adult. If we taking part time job, when we develop adults, what we learn part time job may helps me sometimes. We earn a lot of money. So we learn importance of money. Although we may spend a lot of money in vain before we take part time job, we think it once more and will stop it. Also we spread relationship. we make friends that we we can't make in school life. After that, we eat and drink with them and we really enjoy. But there are bad things. For example, we are too hard to go to school in the morning and go to school in the afternoon. We guradually are patient and may leave school. Also we are cheated. When I read "town work" and call a company, there are wrong information written on it. Also, we go home late and it is dangerous for us, especially women, to walk the dark street alone. Thus, there are a lot of good and bad things. But, I think there are more good things than bad things. I started part time job the other day. Now I am anxious but I expect. I will exprience a serious ploblem. But then I will develop. So I agree with what taking part time job.
