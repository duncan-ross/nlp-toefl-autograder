I strongly believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants because it is really unhealthy for peopleto inhale smoke which is very hazardous for their health; However, if smoking is totally banned from restaurants, I believe that there will be a human rights violation so I would suggest that there should be a designated area for smoking. Most of the Filipinos are not aware of the smoking ban especially those in rural areas unlike in other countries, it is highly implemented and imposed penalty for the violators. I had interviewed some Overseas Filipino Worker s regarding smoking and most of their answerswere YES and it is strictly implemented but there's also some who violate the rules but penalty is highly implemented like in Singapore and United Kingdom as far as I know, smoking in non-designated areas is stirctly prohibited so why can't we also implemeent it and for our good health as well. Our senators have passed a bill on smoking and it was implemented but not applied throughout the country so I would like to suggest that there should be a designated smmoking area for smoking outside the restaurants and this bill should likewise be implemented effective immediately and there should be dessmination campaign for the good of the people and the country as well.
