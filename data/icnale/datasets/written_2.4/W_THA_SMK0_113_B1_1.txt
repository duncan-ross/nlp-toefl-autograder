For me, I think that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of two reasons. The first reason is smoking may cause many troubles for the people surrounding the smoker. In the restaurant, if someone smokes the cigarettes, the other people in the same place may become to the second-hand smoker. Personly, I think cigarette has not any advantages. But it has many disadvantages that's no good for health. Some people was addicted by the cigarette. In the smoke of cigarette has substances that can cause the cancer cell, especially lung cancer. In that case, you will have more risk for lung cancer. The second reason is smoking may cause many problems for the scenery of the restaurant. In my view, I think that the consumer expect to see the good sight-seeing on the restaurant. If someone smokes the cigarettes, the sight-seeing of that restaurant may be bad, and consumer may disappoint. So, I think that all of the restaurants should be the no smoking district. For the end, I hope that someday the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People will think about the common advantages. And that day is a better day for everyone.
