In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, we are not living in the country where people are not smoking. Once people who are not allowed to smoke in the restaurants really want to smoke during dining, where can they go? Just go out side of the restaurants? Do you think it's really a great way to leave the restaurants? If doing this, their parents will be left alone in the restaurants, and this is not a safe behavior for their children. When the person who are eager to smoke, there is no place for the person to smoke. Someone who thinks smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country may say that the smokes may do harm to another people who are dining in restaurants. What can we do about this? I think we can ask the owner of the restaurant to set a closed place for the people who are smoking. Because of the closed place, other people will not be harmed by the smokes. Besides the inner side closed place of the restaurant can let those people who are eager to smoke need not to go out, and they can look at their children in the restaurant. I think we can do this to protect other people who don't smoke; therefore I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
