 Nowadays, college is not only a place for us to study, but also a place where we can learn how to communicate with others and prepare to work in future. So, in my opinion, it's important to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows: First, it's a good way to relieve some students' financial pressure. For some students, their family can't afford to pay the tuition every year, and it will be a pity if they drop halfway. Faced with this problem, some of them turn to their teacher for help and get some money from the school. However, the money is usually not able to cover all of their expense, as a consequence of which, they try to get money by doing a part-time job. For example, a senior used to open a small store in Taobao and find a part-time job near the school at the same time. Therefore, he can pay the tuition by himself and afford his family some money. So doing a part-time job is able to help relieve students' burden coming from financial problem. Second, doing a part-time job is a great chance for us students to improve ourselves. My part-time job is to work in the piano room, which makes me meet plenty of new friends and know how to work with other fellows. Cooperating with people I'm not familiar with is truly a challenge, and I gradually realize that the skill of communication is really important. What's more, doing part-time job makes me understand how important it is to get along with friends as well as strangers, and that making money isn't easy at all. So, you can guess how happy I was when I was paid for the first time! To conclude, a part-time job is surely of great significance, though some of them may take much time and energy. Just manage your time and try doing a part-time job, and you may benefit a lot from it!
