Nowadays, when you are in a coffee, a hotel, or a restaurant, you can always see that someone is smoking. As is known to all that smoking is a form of self-battering that those who must sit by, occasionally joke or complain, and hopeless watch. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. To begin with, it is harmful for public health. The restaurant is the public site. There are always many people eating. If there is someone smoking, all the people sit around him will breathe in the smoke. It does harm to not only himself but also the others. Moreover, it influences others' regular meal. There is no doubt that there is no man is willing to have a meal in a place which is full of smoke. The restaurant is the place intended for eating. All the action which will do harm to the guests' eating should be banned. Last but not the least, smoking is not being encouraged among the public. On the contrary, the government is advocating the citizens to abandon smoking. Smoking at the restaurant is in contradiction with this. As far as I am concerned, banning smoking at the restaurant will build a harmonious situation for meal. And it is also beneficial for the ones who want to quit smoking. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants immediately.
