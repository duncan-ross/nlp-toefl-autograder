I disagree because I believe that smoking should not be banned in restaurants. In the ideal world, restaurants and customers would dictate the restaurant policy and customers would choose their preferred restaurants accordingly. The patrons would decide, without any assistance from the Japanese government, whether they wish to spend their time in smoke-filled restaurants or to even sit in a non-smoking area if they choose. I don't believe that governments should be controlling restaurant owners in so far as telling them what their own patrons can and cannot do. I just do not feel that is right and is stepping outside the boundaries of government. I understand that one of the jobs of government is to protect citizen's general well being, but some research has shown that the affects of passive smoking have yet to be agreed upon by the medical authorities and therefore, claims that suggest that passive smoking kills everybody may or may not be true. Until the government knows for certain that this is so, then they need to demonstrate some restraint before making hasty decisions. Even then, I still do not believe that they should interfere in this particular issue and should leave it to the public to resolve.
