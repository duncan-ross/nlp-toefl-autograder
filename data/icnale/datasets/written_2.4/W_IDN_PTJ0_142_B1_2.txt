Aside from making you more employable after college, having a part-time job will help you financially. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including food, books, gas, and clothes. Since you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. This way, you are not overwhelmed with your monthly payment when you find yourself working a much lower playing job than you had hoped for right after college. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of your parents shoulders if they are helping you with your expenses. Your parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner you begin this process, the easier it become 100% independent financially. Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. If you have specific bills that need to be paid every month, such as cell phone, you will learn to budget so that you have enough money for them. This will make independent living less of a shock later on, when you have multiple bills) to pay monthly. Having some if your own money also makes you appreciate its value. You may think twice about a purchase that you do not really need if it is coming out of your hard-earned paycheck. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the job available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future.
