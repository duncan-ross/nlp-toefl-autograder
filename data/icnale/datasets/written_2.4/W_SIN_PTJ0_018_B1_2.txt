Part time jobs are jobs that people do just for quick cash within a short period of time. People who go for part time jobs are usually students who are on holidays, they look for part time jobs to gain some experience before they step into the society. Part time jobs allow students to not only have gain experience in the working environment, but also allow us to know the hardship of earning a living. It is also a good avenue for us to pass time, and not just hang out with our friends during our holidays. Through these jobs, we can not only make friends, but also form alliance with people in the company. This way, should we be interested in working for the company again, it would be easier for us to get in. However part time jobs have its disadvantages as well, companies offer us a lower pay due to our lack of experience, even though our work capacity is on par with the experienced workers. This is unfair to students, as jobs should be paid based on capability and merits, and not experience. I say so because, even though an experienced worker has many years of experience, it is us the newer generations who are better with things like technology.
