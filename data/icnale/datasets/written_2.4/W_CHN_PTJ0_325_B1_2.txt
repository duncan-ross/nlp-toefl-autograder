Nowadays, more and more college students will apply for a part-time job during their study. Some people think that it is just a waste of time. But some people take an opposite attitude on this problem. I think the latter is right. I believe that it is necessary for students to have a part-time job. It is true that students cannot focus all their attention on their subjects because they should spend some time on their job. But that is not to say that the former view is totally decisive. In my opinion, no one can deny that the part-time job can many benefits. Firstly, college students can learn how to get along well with others and obtain working experience when they adjust to the new job. Secondly, they can understand the difficulty of earning money and learn to save money. Thirdly, college students may realize what they are interested in and which way they long to choose in the future if they are at sea. What is more, students will understand the meaning of taking the responsibility and become a mature man. Only they experience it, they can grow up. Students today should keep pace with the development of the society. The young must strengthen the sense of competition, the sense of being independent and the sense of self-fulfillment. In conclusion, it is essential for college students to hold a part-time job. I hope that students can adapt to the society more easily and quickly.
