Have you ever smoked? If you say No, you cannot stand the smell of smoke. I am non-smoker, so I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking in the restaurants is not good for other people's health because of second-hand smoking. Even outside of building, smoking occurs second-hand smoking. In the restaurant, it is really small place. If smoker smokes in the restaurant, the damage can be much bigger. For non-smoker's health, smoking at all the restaurants in the country should be banned. Next, smoking in the restaurants can have a bad effect on the foods. Especially the smell of smoke reduces the taste of other people's food. And also smell of smoke makes people lose their appetite. As a result, the restaurants can get damage by smoker. So we need to ban smoking in the restaurants for enjoying the taste of food. In conclusion, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of preventing the second-hand smoking and stopping the bad effects to food. I want to enjoy the meal in a pleasant surrounding at all restaurants in the country.
