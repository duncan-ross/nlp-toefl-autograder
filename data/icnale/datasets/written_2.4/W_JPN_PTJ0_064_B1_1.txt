I disagree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think college students should do what they want to do. We, college students, can do many things; studying, love, club activities, volunteer work, studying abroad, making good friendships, etc. If you want some money to enjoy such as activities, you can have a part-time job. A part-time job is a good way to get money for us and it tells us many important things. Getting new friends, your supervisor's anger to you will make your life more wonderful. But if you only want much money or want to buy very expensive clothes or CDs, you should watch your behavior and yourself and think carefully. Actually, we are happy to make a lot of money and spend them. But to do so, we have to spend a lot of time for working, giving up studying and many other activities. Think again why we come to college? Is it the most significant thing? No. We have many things which we can do only now, during college students. Working part-time should be the way to make our campus life better, but mustn't be the purpose.
