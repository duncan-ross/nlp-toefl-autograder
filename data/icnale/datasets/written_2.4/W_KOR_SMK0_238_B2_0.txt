I know smokers often enjoy their smoking after eating, but I think they have to go out of the restaurant when they are smoking. First of all, if someone smells smoking while he or she is eating, it can be very unpleasant experience to him or her. Because people also feel the taste through the nose, if they smell smoking, their eating will be greatly interrupted. I have similar experience before, and it is extremely terrible. Secondly, smokers always have to consider non-smokers. Smokers can smoke in other place, but non-smoker can not avoid when smokers are smoking nearby them. Thirdly, already smoking is banned at many places, like bus stops or subway station. Restaurants are also one of the public places, so smoking can be tolerated at the restaurants. Finally, smoking can be harmful to food. Indirectly smoking is even more dangerous than directly smoking. If the food is made while somebody is smoking near the food, it can harm people who eat the food, especially when they are non-smoker. That's why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
