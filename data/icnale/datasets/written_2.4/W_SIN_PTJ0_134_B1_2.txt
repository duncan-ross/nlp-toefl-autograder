A college student may take on part-time jobs for different reasons and generally, I do not think that it is good, but not important for college students to have a part-time job. For some of my peers who come from more economically disadvantaged backgrounds and who are not on scholarships, they most often will choose to take on part-time jobs while in college to support themselves. For others, they may want to take on part-time jobs to supplement their incomes even though they can get by comfortably without it. For another group of students, taking on a part-time job during college, or during the summer break, is a good way to gather work experience and explore their interests. This stint will help them tremendously in their career planning and it is in this context I believe college students should take on part-time jobs, albeit not during the normal semester time as this might have an adverse impact on their studies. Having said all that, the nature of the part-time job is also an important consideration to take into account when debating if taking on part-time jobs is important for college students. It would certainly be a waste of talent and time if a college student were to take on jobs like waitressing, but would definitely be extremely helpful if he or she were to take on a banking job and the like where they can apply what they have learnt in college and value-add to the organization. While taking on a part-time job during the holidays is desirable, I also believe strongly that students can gain relevant soft skills and experience which will help them in their future careers by taking up leadership roles in the various co-curricular activities offered in college.
