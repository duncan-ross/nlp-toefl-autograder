Smoking has been a serious social problem for a long time. In our country, several millions of people smoke every day. What is worse, everyone on the earth suffers the air pollution. We should take immediate measures to forbid the smoking before our earth is destroyed thoroughly. Every day, a large amount of people have died of lung cancer because they smoked a lot when they lived. As we all know, smoking kills our health gradually so that our bodies become weaker and every organ come down until we can not breathe and walk. Smoking is such a horrible killer that we can't see. Smoke is not only harmful to person, but also plays a much worse effect on our environment. When one person is smoking, people around him will have the second-hand smoke at the same time, which can leads to serious disease like cancer. On the other hand, smoke contributes to the greenhouse effect which makes our earth become hotter and weather is changeable. Maybe it seems to make no matter as we see today, but in 10 years, we must regret and can only cry to hate ourselves. Look the dying people, look the declining animal series, and look the grey environment. I strongly propose that we mustn't smoke any more.
