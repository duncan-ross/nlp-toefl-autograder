I can not agree more that smoking should be completely forbidden at all the restaurants in this country. First of all, smoking does not only harm the heath of smokers but also affects people around the smokers, especially for pregnant women, children and the elderly. Smoking has been causally linked to cancer, heart and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, passive smoking has been associated with lung cancers, allergies, eyes and skin diseases and so on. Restaurants usually have an enclosed environment where the air is not fresh; smoking will bring more damage to consumers' health. Secondly, smoking is usually considered as a potential cause for fire. Poorly placed cigarettes are very likely to start a fire in a restaurant where many of the furniture are inflammable. On the other hand, as most of the restaurants are equipped with fire alarms. Smoking will trigger fire alarms and will cause problems for the other consumers and the workers in a restaurant. Lastly, smoking are gradually considered as a bad habit and banned in most public places, such as airport, MRT and schools. Even though the restaurants are supposed to be places where people consume foods and get relaxed, there are non-smokers than smokers and it would surely benefit the smokers a lot if smoking are banned in the restaurants.
