I agree if smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country, because the smoke can make the passive people have a bader health than the active. Many doctors have launched that information long time ago. Nowadays, many restaurants have put no smoking icon at their places. This is for keep fresh air in the place. And for the smoking people, don't smoke near the passive. In some restaurant, they have some rooms for smoking people called smoking area, with good circulation air in the room, so the smoke cannot be breathed by the passive. And I think not at restaurant only that smoking should be banned, many public places have to ban smoking too. Like at the bank, airport, mall, and other public places. They have to preserve smoking area for the smoking people. And add some security men for keeping the place free of the smoking people. If they find some smoking people brake the rules, they can warning the people so the people cannot smoke again in the public places. The last trick we should do is put the danger of smoking can make us cancer poster at the public places, so the smoking people can think twice before they do smoke.
