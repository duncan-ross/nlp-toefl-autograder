For the past two years, I have been working part time with an international non-government organization named One Million Lights. Although it's technically a part time job, I perform and operate under the capacity of the Country Head of the Philippines for the organization. My involvement with the organization has been very fulfilling, and has also been very beneficial. First, this part time job of mine keeps me sane. My schedule is always very hectic. Aside from the demands debate and football varsity impose on me, I also have to deal with high expectations in and out of my family. My part time job takes me to another world. It helps me forget about all my problems and channels energy into something new and productive. I guess by taking me out of my usual environment, my part time job at One Million Lights has helped me relax and view new perspectives, especially as I go through college. Second, my part time job allows me to learn new things and hone my current skills. It exposes me to new environments and situations every week. Every encounter is a new experience that I have to learn how to deal with on my own. I guess in this light, my part time job has taught me how to adapt to new things and has helped me become a better person.
