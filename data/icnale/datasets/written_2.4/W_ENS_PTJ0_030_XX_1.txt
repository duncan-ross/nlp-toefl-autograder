The benefits of having a part-time job far outweigh any consequences on studies that having a part-time job may have. Many adults are worried about whether having a part-time job will negatively impact the performance in school of their children, but I think that most children nowadays are good enough at multitasking to be able to handle the stresses and demands of more than simply one primarily use of their time. Having a part-time job in college has taught me how to be a good employee of a company as well as have to be more professional in interacting with other people whose ideas I do not always agree with. I have found out that you do not necessarily have to like someone in order to be able to work with them, and I think it is a good thing if other students can figure out this lesson as well so that they don't simply spend all their time doing any group work that arises with just their friends. I am also to make a small amount of money, but it is enough to have fun on the weekends as well as help my parents pay for some of my school expenses every semester. I feel very proud and very responsible to be able to contribute like this.
