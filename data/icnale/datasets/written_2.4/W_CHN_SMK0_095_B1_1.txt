Smoking, which is a cruel killer for our healthy body; it's not serious to regard it as a fierce monster at all. As a result, smoking itself brings no good anyway, and being smoked is more dangerous and the more important is that we should take an active part in voiding this unnecessary damage. As the first step, I think smoking should be completely banned in public, especially at the restaurant, where so many people gather to have a rest and lunch. For one, smoking itself is not a beneficial thing, we shouldn't allow it to exist in principal, but the fact is, we can see smoking here and there. Under the circumstance, for another, measures should be taken to forbid the smokers smoking at all restaurants for the sake of most people, like the older, women and children, it is our duty to keep them far from smoking. In addition, our country has our special situation: first, we burden the heavy pressure of a large population, and then, we couldn't deprive the life of smoking for the smoking-industry still contributes greatly to our GDP. But even this, our government should make policy from the essential benefit of people, and firstly partly ban smoking at all restaurants, as with the deep development of our country in future, we will get the smoking out of our land completely and pay back a clean air for all of us. Last but not the least, for every person of our country, we should do all we can to build a comfortable atmosphere, and stay away from smoking, which is not only a kind of care for people around us, but for ourselves.
