A person who is not smoker, is also disturbed by smoker. Now days, it has become fashion to smoke. The young generation is especially becoming victim of this. This habit usually comes from bad company, especially friends. Media has also contributed in it. Media show the heroes smoking and some boys impressed from them. They follow the same thing that they see. It is the duty of ours to remove this curse from our society. The children should be educated how to make away from smoking. There should be held seminars to awake people. The cigarettes should not be saled to the teen ages. The advertisements of smoking should be discouraged on TV. The taxes should be increased on cigarettes so they are more expensive. So the people may not buy them. Other things should also be done to prevent smoking.
