My opinion I agree with the smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is very disturbing others. I think that the smoking is not good both healthy smokers and people around him. Although people around you will not smoke but it is too dangerous can cause cancer. Some restaurant have lawns that the smoking ban which I think is correct because the restaurant is for eating, not smoking, so if the smoke is probably out to smoke outside or not disturb others. If I eat already have people smoke near me would not be satisfied and research smell cigarette may spoil the atmosphere and the feeling that food dose not taste at all. The law prohibited not smoke in restaurants, but some people are violated and make others extent. Some people may think that smoking is a personal right but they should know that should smoke where. The smoking in the restaurant make other suffer so stop smoke, please. Therefore, completely banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is good thing and everyone should follow. Although no fear of punishment but should think around you because smoking not harm smoker but also harm people nearby.
