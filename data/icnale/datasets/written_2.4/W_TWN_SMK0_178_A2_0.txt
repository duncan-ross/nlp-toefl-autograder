I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, according to the following reasons. First, the restaurant is a place that people meal. A good surrounding is an important thing of restaurants for the customer. Certainly, people want clear surroundings that they can eat their food joyfully. However, the smokes must make the air that in restaurants bad. Second, many people do not bear the secondhand smoke. The secondhand smoke makes other people hurt their body and health. And the smelling of smokes also makes the people's food bad. Customers want their food delicious, and do not want to smell the smoke. Third, everybody knows that smoking is a bad behavior in our life. There are many compositions in the smoke, and the compositions let people have addiction while they are smoking. For a long time, they cannot help smoking at all times. What is more, smoking often must hurt the body and make people have sickness. To make a long story short, smoke not only bad for their health but also affects other people meal in restaurant. In order to make the quality of restaurants perfect, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.
