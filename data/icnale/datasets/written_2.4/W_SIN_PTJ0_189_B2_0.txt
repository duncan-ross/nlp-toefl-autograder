 I agree that a college student should have a part time job to a large extent. College students should be exposed to real-world situations and experience working life before they graduate. The practical experience will teach students new knowledge and interpersonal skills when they meet different people. Personally, I have worked at Starhub Telecommunications Company as a telemarketer. It was not an easy job but it taught it how to handle rejections and resolve conflicts. In addition, college students should learn to be financially independent by earning their own allowances. This will allow them to learn about the value of money and also help them in their future financial planning. Furthermore, a part time job will be particularly useful for students who are from less well to do families as they can contribute a small amount to support the family as well. However, a part time job might not be advisable for a student who participates in numerous school activities. If too much time is committed towards the part time job, a student may neglect his studies and perform badly. This will be undesirable for his future employment opportunities. Conversely, a student can actually gain from a part time job if he can balance both school and work well.
