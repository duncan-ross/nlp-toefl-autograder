I think to have a part time job is somehow good especially for us student. It's a big help to our daily expenses, especially in our educational needs. We may be able to earn money through our own hands and we will be able to know the significance of having or earning money. Having a part time job has a big help in our daily needs, we will not just expect or depends to our parents to give us the allowance but in our own hands we're expensing our need. But somehow, for the part of our parents, it may be hard for us to handle and balance our studies while working. For them, we need to focus first to our studies for us to get a high grades in school and so that the outcome of it will have a great job in future. For instance, if the child will have a schedule of his/her school at morning until afternoon and his/her work schedule is on evening, the child will have a hard time to do his home works, projects and even he/she will not have time to him/herself and to his/her family. The time for her/himself will be limited and so to his/her studies too.
