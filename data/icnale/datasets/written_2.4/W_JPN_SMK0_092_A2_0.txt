I agree that separation of smoking area is done in the restaurants, because smokers have a right they can smoke without troubling any nonsmokers. In addition, today not only separating smoking area but also using a machine that can sucking smoke and deciding smoking time are done in some restaurants, so nonsmokers can go to there without feeling any smoke. Secondly, if I see from a restaurant side, I think that it should be done for more smokers' coming. Smokers will not go to the restaurant by the over no smoking, so the restaurant have to make smoking area even if it costs some money to make smoking room or machines that sucking smoke. Finally, I am a nonsmoker, but I think that we should defend smokers' rights to some degree. If the restaurant doesn't do separation of smoking area, we most consider entering it. In a word, not only restaurants but also smokers and nonsmokers should face smoking problems. Smokers have a right that they can smoke, and nonsmokers also have a right that they don't smoke passively. To defend rights each other, I think that not no smoking but separation of smoking area should be done in the restaurant.
