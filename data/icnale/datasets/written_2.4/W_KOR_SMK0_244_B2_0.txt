I definitely agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in the restaurants could harm the non-smokers, especially little children, and could distract the joy of eating. First, smoking in the restaurants can make many victims of secondhand smoking. It is well known that secondhand smoking is very harmful to everyone. Especially children who are very vulnerable can have serious influence from secondhand smoke. Many parents accompany their children to have food in the restaurants. However, if smoking is allowed, they would not really want to eat out since the harmful influence will be given to their children and family. To make healthy environment for the family and the customers, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. Second, many people are easily distracted by smoking. Restaurants are often places where the families or friends gather and have fun. However, if smoking is allowed in this kind of places, many people who hate the cigarette smoke will be distracted by the smoke they had from the smokers in the restaurants. The joy of eating food will also be distracted by breathing smoke from cigarette. Smoking in the restaurants can not only have potential fatality of secondhand smoking but also distract the joy of having good food.
