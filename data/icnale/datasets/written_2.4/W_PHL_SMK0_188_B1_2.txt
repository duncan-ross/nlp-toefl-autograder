Global warming is now an alarming issue not only faced by the Philippines, but by the whole world. Smoking is one of the many contributions to the increasing effects of global warming. An effort the Philippines can make in order to slow down the irreversible effects of global warming is by banning smoking. The Philippine government should not put a total ban on smoking at once; however, it should start somewhere, and someplace. One of these places could be restaurants, very public places where people coming from all walks of life gather for numerous reasons. Starbucks, a coffee franchise that has found a developing popularity in the Philippines, has now banned smoking as part of its efforts to save the environment. Ethically speaking, I believe that smoking in restaurants and other public places should be banned in the Philippines because not everyone smokes. Some people, such as myself, think that it is rude to smoke near someone who is aware of the health risks brought by smoking and second-hand smoke. I have experienced eating at a restaurant where I was seated beside a smoker. I found myself losing my appetite as the smoker exhaled his foul smelling smoke in my face. Moreover, smoking does not have any proven positive effects on a smoker aside from the relaxation it brings; however, relaxation could be achieved through other activities that do not harm the environment and other people.
