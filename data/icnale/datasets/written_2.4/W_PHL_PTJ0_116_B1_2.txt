In modern society, it is very common to see teenagers working everywhere in the city. Whatever part time jobs they are doing, they are preparing for their future. School may be the best place for proper education but not for preparation for the outside working world. Indeed, teenagers learn a lot of things through the jobs they do when still being students. To start with, teenagers learn how to arrange their time. For example, an employee needs to work at 7. 00 in the early morning. This means, he has to present at the company by 7. 00 no matter how late he stayed up last night. Moreover, as a student, he has to take use of his time and spend it properly on both studying and working. He avoids bad habits such as going out late at night and get up late in the morning another point is that teenagers will appreciate the value of money. They work hard and realize how difficult to make money. They also understand that Money does not grow on trees. Before buying an expensive clothes or shoes, they remember their parents ' hard work and think more carefully whether they should buy those or not. But the most benefit to teenagers working is that they get some useful experiences which they cannot learn at school. For example, after leaving university, Bill Gates worked outsides and gained valuable experience on what does and doesn't work. From the time starting his career in a garage, he now becomes the most successful man with the modern development of computer technology. Although teenagers have responsibility to concentrate on their academic studies, part-time jobs are also important for their future work. For me part-time jobs are not necessarily essential yet having one is better.
