A part time job for college students is something that I think they have to experience. It is because having a part time job can make students to be more independent, teach them to manage time better, and also prepare them to enter work field. The first reason why I agree to it is because part time job can make students become more independent. They can learn to do things by themselves because in their job, they also have to do things that are being asked to them. They don't only depend on people to get what they want. Secondly, part time job can also teach students to manage their time. It is because when students have a part time job, they have to divide the time for working and studying carefully. They have to use their time effectively, so that they can work and also get good scores in their study. The last reason why I agree to the students to have part time job is because by working part time, students can be prepared to enter work field. Although students only work part time, they still experience the real work setting. They know what to do in the real work situation, to perform well, and to be responsible for the things that are being trusted to them. Thus, based on the reason above, I strongly agree that students, especially college students should have part time job, because it can make them more independent, teach students to manage their time better, and also prepare them to enter work field.
