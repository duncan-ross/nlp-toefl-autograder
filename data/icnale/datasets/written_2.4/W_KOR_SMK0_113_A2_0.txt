I agree that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. One of the major chemical components of cigarettes known as nicotine causes people's addiction in smoking. Once you get hooked on to the habit of smoking it is extremely difficult to quit. It is not hard to find people around us who try to quit the habit of smoking and the process is just not that simple and easy. The longer you have smoked it is harder to quit. In Korea, since early 2000, the government had already started to ban smoking in public areas such as bus stops, subway stations, and some of the indoor restaurants. They also have raised the price of cigarettes few times as an effort to decrease the number of smokers. It is scientifically proven that smoking causes numerous types of cancers. And even more shockingly, second hand smoking causes more damage to non smoker's body than actual smokers. Smokers are putting non smokers in great danger by exposing them to smoke. It is true that non smokers find cigarette smoke unpleasant and they do not want to be around them. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it will not only protect people's health and their well beings but also it may help to decrease the number of smokers in the country.
