Smoking is always bad for non-smoker people because it has a very bad smell and it will cause the lung cancer but some smokers never cares about this, they smoke wherever they want. Therefore, there's a rule for forbidding smoking in some places. I think it is very good if smoking is completely banned in restaurant but it is quite impossible. In my opinion, there is a solution for this issue, all the restaurants should provide the specific areas for smoking such as the room or at the corner of the restaurant, and these areas must have the property that when smoking occurs, the smoke must be protected so that other people can't see or smell it. But if some smokers still smoke at the general area in the restaurant, they should be fined. Finally, the government should release the new command to the restaurant about the smoking area. If the restaurant has no area to do this, the owner must make his restaurant completely ban for smoking or tell the customer to smoke outside the restaurant. In conclusion, a restaurant is the place where many people visit, there're both people who smoke and don't smoke, for the happiness of all people, smoking should not be completely banned but must be taken in the proper area in the restaurant. If this could be done, everybody would live happily and non-smoker people will not have a lung cancer anymore.
