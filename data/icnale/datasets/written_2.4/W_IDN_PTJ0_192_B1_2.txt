It is important for college students to have a part-time job and I agree. Actually it depends to themselves. Human use two side of brain. Left brain for intelligence and right brain for creativity. Maybe students who mostly use their left brain, like to focus on their study, so, we cannot force them to have a part time job. Different from left brain users, students who mostly use their right brain, like to use their creativity. Pouring creativity can be in many ways. Maybe in sport, music, cooking, etc. Many right brain users like to study while have a course outside college, or have a part time job for their creativity. But, I suggest left brain users also have a part time job. Maybe they can have a part time job in an office, be a part time teacher, etc. If they like science, they can be science teacher for high school students, etc. Part time job have many positive effect. They can earn money, apply their knowledge which they got from their college at their work place. The most important effect is, they can earn life experiences. So, right after they graduate, they already have visions about their job in the future.
