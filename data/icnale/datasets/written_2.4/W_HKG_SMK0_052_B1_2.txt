Smoking is a bad habit which causes negative impacts to our health, but the numbers of people who smoke stay high, leading to a debatable topic on whether or not smoking should be banned in all restaurant. Before giving my standpoint, I would like to define the term 'restaurant'. For me, restaurant refers to an indoor place which provides meals. Thus restaurant doesn't mean bar or café which only serve snacks and drink. As there are less people from all walks of life, and I don't see a big impact in these places. On the other hand, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants, as there are many different kinds of people having meals there. They may be children, students, pregnant women, and many other non-smokers. Smoking causes second-hand smoke which surely harms the other's health. It would be unfair to those who don't smoke, as they are forced to "smoke". No one has the right to harm the others. Thus the smoker should not have to smoke around the non-smokers. Some people may say they also have the right to smoke, but I think this stands only when they are not affecting the others. I think the law is powerful enough to prevent the second-hand smoke from harming the non-smokers' health. Hope that by restricting the smoking venues, the number of smokers will decrease and more and more people will get rid of this bad habit.
