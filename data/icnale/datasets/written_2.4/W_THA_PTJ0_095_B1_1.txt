It is important for college students to have a part-time job? I think a part-time job can provide both positive and negative ways for college students. It is depends on an attitude of each student, if student who would like to live as luxurious live, then a part-time job is not going to be a good thing because those will spend lots of money, but for students who parents does not have that much money, then a part time job is quite important. There are two benefits is that reducing expenditure of their family, and increase work's experience. First, a part time job can reduce expenditure of a family because the students will have money for their living cost, so they do not have to ask for parent's money. and also can help parents out by pay some part of university fees. Moreover, parents can save money for other expenditures of a family, too. Second, a part time job also increases work's experience. They will learn how to make self-discipline because in a future these students will have to go working for a company or anywhere, so this is a good way to train their behave to be an adult. As you see I have mentioned above, a part-time job could reduce social problems because the student who get a part-time job will have responsibility on their duty, and they will not have much time for hang out around at night with their friends as much as they could. Therefore, I think a part-time job need to be supported by a government and family.
