I think it is not important for college students to have apart-time job. I have three reasons why college student should not have part- time job. Firstly, College students have parents to support them about cost of study. They should only concentrate on study not doing part-time job. In my opinion, their parents want them to pay attention to study m ore than doing a part-time job for sure. Second, if college students do part-time job, they could not have enough time to study and do their homework. In addition, doing part-time job is not good for their health, because they have to study at day time and do part-time job at night time. They might be so tired. When they were in class and could not pay much attention to class. It is not good for their health and it is too hard for them to do two things in the same time. These are reasons why it is unnecessary for college students to have a part-time job. They have parents to support them a cost of study, it could make them pay less attention to study if they do part -time job and it is not good for their health.
