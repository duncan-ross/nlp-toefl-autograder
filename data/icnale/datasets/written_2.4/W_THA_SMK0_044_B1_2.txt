Today, the rate of smokers is increasing. We can find them anywhere even in restaurants. They are harming people's life. They can't stop because smoking is like a drug addict. In restaurant, people want fresh air to breathe when they eat. Person that smokes in restaurant has no manner. We can only hope that there will be a decreasing of smokers. Stop-smoking campaigns as we see today can decrease a little. If we want to decrease the amount of smokers, we should help together. Smoking should be banned at every place not only restaurants. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is impossible to make people stop smoking. This world will be better and many people will be healthier if we can decrease the amount of smokers. Finally, smoking will harm yourself and other people if you don't stop now.
