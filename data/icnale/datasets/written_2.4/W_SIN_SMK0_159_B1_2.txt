Smoking is a vice in today's society. Governments also introduce many policies and laws to discourage people from smoking and to promote healthy lifestyles. These days, we also see many places banning smoking within the premises. However, I feel that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It takes time for smokers to quit smoking. If they are completely banned at all the restaurants, it will cause much inconvenience and difficulty to them. They will need to look for suitable places to take a puff and this may be a hassle for most of them. Hence, this may cause distress and smokers may be less motivated to quit smoking because they feel that they are discriminated against by society. Moreover, it may lead to decreased sales for some restaurants which cater mainly to smokers, which may be situated near night clubs and pubs. There will be fewer people who patronize these restaurants and hence, these outlets may close down in the future. Thus, I propose that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. Instead, a small smoking zone could be set up outside the restaurants for smokers, away from the non-smokers who dine in the restaurant. This way, it will make the dining experience a more memorable and relaxing one.
