Many people don't like smokers smoke around them when they are eating and they think smoking should be completely banned at restaurants. I partly agree with this opinion. For instance, if a person eats alone in a small room in the restaurant, he has the right to smoke. Eating with your friends together in a small room in a restaurant, you also can smoke if you friends don't mind. But in most situations, smokers frequently smoke in restaurants and don't care other people's feeling. Even smoking is more harm to people who sit around smokers than smokers. Because smoking produce nicotine which is harm to people's health and people who are forced to intake nicotine have a second smoking, professionals say people who have a second smoking intake nicotine more than smokers by about 13 times. In this case, it's necessary for government to make a policy that people can't smoke in public restaurants. Take Chinese smokers for example, most smokers don't listen to waiters or waitresses' suggestions when they keep smoking in restaurants. Generally speaking, different countries have different problems in the aspect of smoking. Whether or not completely ban smoking in the restaurants should depend on different situations.
