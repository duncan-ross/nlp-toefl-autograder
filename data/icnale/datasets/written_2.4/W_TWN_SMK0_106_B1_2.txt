I think it is good to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Because, for the first thing, the smell of smoking is really annoying for the people who are not a smoker, so if I smell somebody is smoking when I am ready to enjoy my dishes, I will be not happy. Second, smoking is bad for health, if all restaurants are not be allowed to smoke, maybe it is helpful to reduce the volume of smoking. Third, for the people who are not smoker, second-hand smoking is more harmful to them than the smokers especially for children, so don't smoke in public is a way to show respective. Although completely ban smoking may arise some disagree from somkers, it should be taken because of the strengths of doing this. In sum, smoking is not a good thing, and I always encourage my father to take less or try to quit it in consider of his health. In my opinion, we should encourage quitting smoking and we will be more healthful and the air will be more clear than before. Because of my reasons listed, I think it is good to completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country, and it should be taken as soon as possible and have to be taken strictly.
