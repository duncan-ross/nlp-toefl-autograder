Now the government in Thailand try to promote a campaign for stop smoking in public areas and restaurants. Even in the pub, bar, nightclub, there are many signs to warn the smokers that these places are not allowed them to smoke. It's very campaign because the government support that and there is punishment. They will be fined for 2000 baht. Anyways, the campaign is good but in reality, there are still many places that they allow people to smoke in their restaurants. There are air condition and non air condition rooms in the restaurants, some people still smoke in air condition areas. The smell is around the room. It's very bad pollution. One thing I notice, servers don't try to tell the customers if the customers are not Thai people. In fact, most of Thai people respect the rules if the restaurants say that 'no smoking'. They try to not smoke in that area. But in tourist places, many foreigners smoke in the restaurants. I don't want to blame them. The owners or servers have to tell them to stop. If we don't tell them, they don't care about that. Finally, I agree about the statement to now allow people to smoke in the restaurants.
