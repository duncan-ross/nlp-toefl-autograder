Normally, when you happen to eat out with your family or your friends, what you'll look for is just a fine restaurant. Suppose that you are eating a very yummy dish in the finest restaurant in town but, you can smell smoke form cigarettes instead of yummy food. What will you do? And do you think that smoking is ruining your dinner? In my own view, smoking should be banned everywhere. In other words, every exception for smoking should be abolished as well. Firstly, I can not see any advantage of smoking. Instead, smoking only cause health trouble no matter who is smoking or whoever who happen to be near a smoker. Nicotine in the cigarettes just makes you addicted to it, and hard to stop smoking. Secondly, the smoke from the cigarettes pollutes the atmosphere. Lastly, you will never be good-looking with a cigarette in your mouth. Due to the fact that smoking never gives us any benefit moreover, bad smell, diseases and ugliness are the things left for people after smoking. Finally, smoking should be banned in every way. It is not just in the restaurants but in every single place for the better appearance, the better place and the better opportunity in one's life.
