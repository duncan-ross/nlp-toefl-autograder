I think that in general it is a good idea to ban smoking at restaurants. I have been around long enough to see many of my friends as well of my older relatives suffer the harmful effects that smoking can bring such as cancer in the worst cases, and just a nasty smoker's cough in other cases. I do not want to see any more of my loved ones suffer these kinds of consequences, and I know that there will be a direct impact upon the health of people with banning smoking at restaurants. I think the Japanese people are smart enough to realize this too, and so they should make haste in passing some kind of law or rule that would ban smoking in their restaurants. If they do this, they will be doing a favor to the current generation as well as to the next generation of citizens, and that is what a government is supposed to do. Finally, we have to remember that everything these days is all about money, and so we will need to find some way for the restaurants and the tobacco companies to keep their profits if we want to ban smoking in restaurants in any short or foreseeable time frame.
