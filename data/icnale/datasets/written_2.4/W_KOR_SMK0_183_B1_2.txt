I agree. Smoking in public places that would inflict damage to another person. We smoke while in others physically and mentally to the damage. A place with me because everyone else should have manners and can be used together. Tobacco is the cause of cancer in the world. There are also addictive. In addition, for the other party is known to cause cancer even more. We begin to think that smoking in public places would not think it is not good? So, most restaurants do not harm others in order to create a separate smoking area. We know. Smoke than those who do not smoke a lot of people are dying of lung cancer. What these words mean? We always drink the smoke of smokers are living proof. Smokers breathe in the smoke through the filler, but we unfiltered cigarette smoke, but we make than prohibiting smoking that makes people off the premises. In other words, we not only restaurant anywhere else in the smoking area to prevent damage to other people should try to smoke. But we all live alone and do not forget to live together. And then I care to others is a habit. Ten kinds of behavior always occur when one kind of behavior should remember that.
