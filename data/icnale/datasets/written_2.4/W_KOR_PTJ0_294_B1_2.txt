I agree that college student has part-time job. I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. The first reason is money. Tuition of college is very big money. Because of this, parents is so hard. so, it is nice that you make money with part-time job to earn own pocket money. secondly, it is great for socialization. having part-time job, you will meet many person. so, it is a good plan to have part-time job to learn social life. next, you know difficulties of making money and advisedness of spending. you will learn that you spend money economically. because you are very hard to make money. last, you will great at time management. With having part-time job, habit of lastness can be cured. and because of shortage of time, you will learn the value of time. so, you will spend time worthily. Of cause, having part-time job for college student has weakness. For example, a shortage of time, frequent accidents, etc. but, advantage of having part-time job outnumber disadvantage. and having part-time job is very good experience with your college life. so, i agree that college student has part-time job with above reasons.
