We usually eat outside at least one meal and we can see smoking people in that site. If you are a non-smoking person, you can eat cigarette smoke instead of the food. Recently, the article that people around smoking people are higher the risk for lung cancer than smoking people was announced. At least, if we are considerate people that think others than me, I think that we must not smoke at the public site like restaurant. Also by globalization society, there are a lot of foreigners in Korea. They have to eat Korea's food at Korea's restaurant. There are also people that don't like to smoke near them. If they who comes Korea because of love for Korea see smoking people at Korea's restaurant, they will think all of Koreans are impolite. And there are also children come with their parent. If we smoke in front of them, children weakened immune systems can be more harmful their health. And it can be impacted children's education purpose which improves Korea's future. I think you already know smoking is not good all aspect in our life. Although it is hard to quit smoking, why don't you stop smoking than to undergo hate eye?
