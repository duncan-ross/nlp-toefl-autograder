 The saying: Smoking is killing yourself. , in my mind, must be seen in everywhere. I hate smoke, for the smoking brought me many terrible memories. My grandfather dead of smoking, the lung cancer that caused by years' smoking took him away from me when I was just 12. I just don't understand that why such many people who know smoking is harmful are still smoking. And the number of smokers has been larger when the age of started to smoke has been younger! It feels so bad that the people live with you are all smokers. But the truth is that China has the largest number of smoking people in the world! Smoke was used as a kind of medicine at first. Because of its unusual addiction, smoke was sold as normal goods by companies to make exorbitant money. In this way, smoking has many similarities with taking drugs. You spend money and health on smoke, making everyone who loves you to be worried. I hate smoke. In my point of view, smoking should be allowed only when you are alone. As the secondhand smoke which referred to as passive smoke can cause more serious health problem, people who do not smoke also are in risk when someone smoke around. It is unfair that you smoke cost other's health. So, smoking must be a private action and must influence in personal too. At last, I have something to say. To those smokers, you should love yourself, your family and your own live. One less cigarette a day means more love to everyone. To those who do not smoke, please tell smokers around you to quit smoking if you really love him or her. In a word, keeping away from smoke, as a result, long and happy life you will have.
