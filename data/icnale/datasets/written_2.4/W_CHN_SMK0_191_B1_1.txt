More and more people have been addicted to smoking, even in the restaurant. In my opinion, I'm against this opinion to smoke and it is unacceptable, unreasonable to behave like this. People should not smoke in the restaurant. But we can do something to solve the problem. However, some people think that it is common and even enjoyable to smoke in the restaurant because they do have their own freedom and they have rights to do that. In addition, to some extent, smoking has been becoming parts of their lives. What's more, no smoking during the dinner may make them feel unhappy. On the contrary, other people argue that smoking should be banned in the restaurant. The reasons are as follows. At first, smoking not only does harm to their own health, but also others'. Moreover, it is undeniable that smoking is not suitable for the environment of the restaurant. We need good environment to have a meal in the restaurant. Last but not least, every customer has the same responsibility for protecting the surroundings during meals. Something must be done in the restaurant to deal with the problem of whether we can smoke in the restaurant. In my opinion, we can set up a public place especially for smokers. Thus the problem will not exist.
