Smoking is one of the most deadly silent killers, yet millions of people pretty much unaware of this sad reality that plagued our world. It brings harms and diseases to the active smoker and worse consequences for those passive smokers. Even worse, the younger generations nowadays started to smoke, thanks to those advertisements that depict smokers as macho men, adventurous men etc. and the lack of government's interference to restrict underage people from smoking. Smoking is okay but only in limited places, and the governments recently build smoking rooms in public places. But the only few the smokers who ever used in this facility and still smokes in everywhere like they are the only people who live. It is clear that smoking should be banned from the public places, especially restaurants. People who smoked at the restaurants will pollute the air with their smoke, not seeing the harms they brought to other non-smokers. Who non-smokers who would like to enjoy their feasts with the aroma of tobacco smoke? Smoking in the restaurants is egoistical actions that took the rights of the non-smokers for being healthy and breathe fresh, clean air by force. In my conclusion, smoking in the restaurants should be banned in all restaurants across the country since it brings nothing but diseases and sickening smoke.
