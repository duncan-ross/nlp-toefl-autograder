Smoking is a bad habit in my point of view. On our society, the person who smoke is detest or there is nobody need to stay near him or her who smoke because the terrible smell and a danger from the smoke. So, in our country there are the low or the discipline that do not allow people smoke in the public place and the restaurant also in order to protect others people who do not smoke from it affects. If there are a people who break the low, they will be fined. However, I think that the sentence that they get is a light thing. Because smoke can cause many diseases such as cancer, allergy, and etc. that lead to dead. Therefore, to cope this trouble we must completely ban at all in any public place, especially restaurant in our country for the better quality in the people life and better quality of people mind and can make our society to be place that we can live safely without the health problem from the smoke affect any more. Finally, I hope that in the future Thailand will be the first country where smoking is be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
