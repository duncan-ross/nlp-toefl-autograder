I strongly agree with this and feel need. Especially in Korea, the tuition fee is very higher than the other countries and the parents obviously can't afford it easily at once. What is more, the students have an ability to live their own life by themselves. They are adults. Of course, it's difficult to work all day taking classes. And now, I'd like to explain why it is important to have a part-time job. Firstly, it doesn't need much time, disrupt university life during vacation, or your rest of time except for class, you can work without disrupting your study because you can choose the time you want to work. It's an advantage for students. Lastly, these days, many companies want you to have many previous jobs before they give you a position. They want you to be adapted to the position easily. So, it means that you can make experience which can be benefits for the future as well. Besides, if you have certain ability, For example, if you can speak English well, the pat-time job in restaurant near where foreigners live will give you the chance to practice or enhance it. This is why I think to have a part-time job is important for students.
