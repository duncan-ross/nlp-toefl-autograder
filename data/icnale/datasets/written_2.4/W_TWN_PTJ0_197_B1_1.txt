Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Yes, it is very important thing for college students. Why do I say that ? Because the students working hard to earn more money before they realize their parents for their hard work over and over again. Although the part-time job will reduce the time to learn lessons, but why do I agree with students working. Because the students working hard to earn more money and then learned that the hard work of parents, try to cut unnecessary spending to reduce the burden of parents. Not only in the working period can make many new friends to also improve interpersonal relations, but also can become a broad view of self, but also learn a responsible attitude and understanding of the importance of division of labor, as a gregarious person. Take myself as an example, I had been to restaurant waiter, but also because of this I can appreciate the staff's hard work, and in the working period I also learned how to deal with customers, how to meet with colleagues and how to get along with the ephors and so for. There are many other skills, which are not be teacher in school. Therefore, I think college students working experience of life is an important part.
