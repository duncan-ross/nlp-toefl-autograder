I think when you are college students, You should concentrate for study. If you have a part-time job while you study, you do it not extremely. You shouldn't do two things in the same time. If you have part-time job, you could have enough time for reading or free time for relaxation. Although you have much money but you haven't life while study. You could have not time for your friend and family. You won't do something, you want to do. You could try for studying and part-time job. Do you think ? if you have much money but you don't have friend. Are you happy? But if you think more. When you have part-time job, you have experience more many people. There are advantages and disadvantages, we should be very selective and careful to choose. Part time give you experience and money but you may lose friends in the university and you may fail the study because you don't have time to revise the book and do the homework. Studying only, you may study very well, concentrate to the study, classroom. You have interactions with your teachers and your friends in the university, you may have good friends, close friends but you don't have experience for working. But for me, studying only is better in this time.
