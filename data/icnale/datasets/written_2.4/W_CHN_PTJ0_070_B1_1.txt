Recently, more and more college students have a part time job when their time is vacant. I partly support that it is important for college students to have a part time job. In my opinion, college students become more independent and have more free time. Some college students spend a lot of time in online games. Instead of this, students could look for a part time job. It can make most use of their time and their lives could be more interesting. Finding a part time job can also let us know the difficulties from employment and adapt ourselves to society. And when we are working, we can learn some special skills and knowledge which we are not able to get access to in our college. We could develop our ability through the part-time job. For example, we can become considerable and careful if we take a job as a waiter or waitress. Personally speaking, as college students, we should try to get into the society around us, because we become adults at the same time. So there is no doubt that taking a part job is a shortcut. We can gain some unforgettable experience form it. So if you have time, try to look for a part-time job.
