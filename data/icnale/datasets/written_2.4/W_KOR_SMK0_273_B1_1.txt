Smoking doesn't have to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, as the right of smokers has to be guaranteed, the right of non-smokers has to be protected. Also, when it comes to a case of restaurant where people eat dishes and enjoy the smell and taste, people have to be prevented from exposing to other bothering smell or mood except that of dishes itself or that of the restaurant itself. For it, all the restaurant owners have to make separated places for smokers in their restaurants. If they can't afford to prepare the separated rooms for smokers, smoking has to be completely banned inside. Because smoking is a thing of preference, but being healthy is an essential thing for all people. There have already been prepared separated rooms in each restaurant for smokers, and this movement have to be prevail. It's a good phenomenon to respect both of smokers and non-smokers. At first people didn't recognize the right of non-smokers. Society left them exposed to the cigarette, and it seemed that smokers also didn't care about non-smokers. Time passed by, as the discontentment of non-smokers was getting bigger and bigger, excessively coercive regulation have been occurred. Surely, exposure of smoke to people is really bad and unfair thing. It must be banned. However, as society respects non-smokers, smokers also have to be accepted in a proper way.
