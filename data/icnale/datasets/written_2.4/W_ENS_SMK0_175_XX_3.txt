I agree. These types of bans have already been introduced in many countries and quite a lot of them in the USA have included restaurants. Everybody knows that anybody that smokes is taking a significant risk, what is still being debated though are the affects of second-hand smoking which is more popularly referred to as passive smoking. In theory, the arguments should e the same as those that apply to direct smoking. There is a lot of convincing research that shows that second hand smoke is just as deadly and this has been tested and upheld in several court cases. We do know that cigarettes contain chemicals that are toxic and not natural for human consumption. Based on this fact alone, it says a lot about the deadly effect of smoking whether you're a smoker or a naive non-smoker. These chemicals are deadly and harmful to all who inhale them. If a smoker makes a choice to smoke then they should be willing to accept the consequences of their actions. If these consequences also include restrictions, bans or isolation, then that is the price that smokers have to pay for the privilege of smoking. Non-smokers though, don't always get to choose when they are not aware, until the last second that they have just smelled/inhaled smoke.
