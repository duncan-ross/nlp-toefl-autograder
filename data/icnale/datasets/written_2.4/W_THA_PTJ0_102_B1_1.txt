In my opinion. I agree for college students to have a part-time job. Because they will have income and they make their free time benefit. They drill to take time out for future. They have a lot of experiences from working. They help parent for subside expenditure. At present economy is bad so people fight for good life. Life is a struggle for existence they said. And a job is really hard to find for work. Many people have no jobs to work, they are very poor. Some of them are very old and no one want them to work. But for students, we strong so many jobs want us to do. we can do everything and we can do very long. A part-time job have many profit. Such as they have much money, they meet friends, who like a same thing, they get a new experience, and they have new friends. In the future the college students have to have a part-time job everybody. Because a thing is more expensive. Such as cars, homes, computer, mobile phone, cereal, food. Cause there's a famine in the world. People fight for food and drink. Most people is nutrition deficiency. So the college students to have a part-time job for future.
