Part time job is convenient work. This is for student, office worker, etc people that have deficient time. Student can make tuition with part time job; Office worker can make living-expenses too. I'm working to part time job too. I'm working at meat restaurant. I work to wash many hot grills for 8 hours. I'm so hard but in payday I'm very happy. The pay is used my pocket money. So I don't receive pocket money from my parents. Also sometimes, office workers work to part time job. They are usually low income salaried employee. Because of inadequacy living-expenses they work to part time job. Part time job is finding of fantastic form to work for them. Also for employers is good too. They sometimes need to employ person at weekend, holiday. Because like the day, many restaurant is very busy. Therefore they employ the part time job worker. If there are a few workers at weekend and holiday, they are obstinate. Thus for employer as well as employee, part time job a useful form of work. I agree the part time job. It is a convenient work form. If part time job disappear, worker is poorer, employee is harder. Part time job is helpful, valuable in various ways.
