As a college student, we have a lot of choices to fill our free time. Some students just study in the library, some join clubs which they are interested in. Also, there are a number of students who choose to get a part-time job after class. According to some graduates' experience, having a part-time job is really important. Firstly, we have a lot of free time in our college life, and we all know that we have no excuse to waste it. As a result of it, besides study and clubs, getting a part-time may be a wise choice. Secondly, we can get some money from the part-time job, although it is not much, it can help to afford our cost of living in the campus. Thirdly, a part-time job is beneficial for us to improve our ability of communication and increase our working experience. It is universally known that they will be very useful when we graduate and need to find a stable job in the future. Finally, when we are working for the part-time job, it gives us a very good chance to build friendship. We will earn some unforgettable memories from the job. Even though a part-time job cannot give us a lot, it is still important for us to have it.
