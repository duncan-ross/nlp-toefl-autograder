When I first came to college, we learned in orientation that only 15% of the student populace on our campus admitted that they were smokers. On the other hand, almost 90% of the student populace on our campus said that they thought that smoking was disgusting, and that they would never date a partner who smoked. I thought this was funny because it means that if you want to have a boyfriend or girlfriend on our campus, it basically means that all you have to do is not smoke. I don't know what the percentages are in Japan, but I do know that smoking is disgusting no matter where you are in the world, and it makes your clothes smell very bad. Also, it is very bad for your health and smoking can decrease the number of years you have to live. I want to live as long as possible so I take the health and fitness and eating healthy foods very seriously, and it is really a slap in the face when you go to a party and someone is blowing smoke in your face. The same thing is true at restaurants, and if Japanese people feel the same as I do, they should ban smoking in their restaurants.
