I agree with this statement, part-time job are important for college students because college students should making some money for their living cost by themselves, beside their parents keep helping for finance. At least we can help our parents with having a part - time job. On the other hand we can practice our skills too before we really do a job after we graduate. So we knew how the fields are and how far our skill does. Part-time job. Sometimes some parents do not want their children do a job, because they do n ot want their children suffer. For some reasons too parents do not want their children work. Far beyond parents thought, we as a college students need some extra money for our living cost for hang out with friends, for daily needs and for some entertainments. I have some experience having a part - time job, I work for my grandma's restaurant at Bali selling fried chicken, that is a lot of fun. I have paid too even that's my grandma's restaurant. They appreciate what I have done. I am at cashier counting some money and receive customer's order then give it to the kitchen. I thought that would be difficult, but it doesn't, it is fun. Having a part - time job for college students are so important, that because many of college students do that, just to fill their boring day at campus and it can make money of it, that is a lot of profit.
