Some people may think that university students should focus on studying; they have needed not to work yet. However, I think having a part-time job is one part in university life. There are my points of view. First, having part-time job can gain working experience. As everyone saw the news that a Chinese University master cannot get a job, we should need to build up our resume in order to show our quality to persuade employer to hire. We must accommodate to be a worker so we need to have a part-time job first. Everything needs buffer, we may face difficulty if we suddenly change own life style. As a result, we need to work partly, and then we can work successfully. Besides, students can earn some money for daily life. All of us know that the tuition fee costs $40, 000 a year, and travelling fee is not cheap too. It may be a burden for the family. Thus, having a part-time job is a very good way to reduce the stress caused by the extra expense. University students are mature people, so we have responsibility to control our personal finance, try to decrease the expense which is less than income. Thus, we can be a successful people in the future, avoid facing financial problem. In conclusion, having a part-time job is important and will not waste some much time. Students must balance their time and spare some time for working.
