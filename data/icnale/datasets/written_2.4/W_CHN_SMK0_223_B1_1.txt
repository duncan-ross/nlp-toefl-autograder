That's what I think of upon seeing the word smoking. Tobacco contains a lot of poisonous substance. So it is universally acknowledged that smoking is not a good habit. Smoking alone is equal to suicide, and smoking in public is equal to murder. It's very impolite to smoke in front of people who don't smoke. Smoking will make people around feel terrible. It will destroy your impression left to others. According to some research, secondhand smoking is more poisonous. This is one of the reasons why we shouldn't smoke. Another reason is because it is dangerous to surroundings, too. A cigarette can cause a huge fire if not dealt with well, which will ruin all your properties and even end your valuable life. And the factory producing cigarettes is also dangerous to the environment. The factory will produce poisonous gas and water. To some degree, this is also harmful to human beings. Have you realized that there are not any good results if we continue to smoke? We will destroy our environment, our friends, our own life----as long as we don't stop smoking. What a terrible thing! Cigarette is not a good invention. It has murdered millions of people. It is our duty to stop smoking from damage more people, from now on!
