I totally agree this statement. Because each college student had accepted his parents' fund and supply for20 years at least, he should become economic independent since he entered college life even though the son or the daughter of Bill Gate. By doing part-time job, the student also learns how to act with people, it means part-time job makes students become braver in front of the strangers and maybe learn the soul of service. This is a great pre-job practice and as well as helps the development of the society. If a college student doesn't have a part-time job, he may be accustomed to depending on his parents or others. Or we can say, he needs to take money from his parents so maybe he can focus on his study and get great marks, but indeed he just practice the school skill only, and until the moment of graduation he doesn't realize the really life outside the college. No matter how excellent his marks are, he just wastes an opportunity to learn more in the college life. But I have to remind that being a college student at all; he can not put too much time on part-time job than the time for study anyway. If a college student does so, he must effects his study at college-his responsibility. And it not an appropriate behavior for a student and may also harm his parents' hearts. In short, a college student should try to have a part-time job but not to allow the time exceeds the time for study.
