 At present, it becomes a trend that college students go in for part-time jobs in their spare time. As far as I am concerned, it's important for us to do proper part-time jobs. Entering college means the first time to be really individual to most students. And after all we will sooner or later walk into the real society and face many challenges alone. Definitely, while in college, it's quite a good opportunity to enhance our ability to cope with many difficulties that we probably come across later. For example, how to deal with the interpersonal relationship properly how to face the huge tasks that your boss set and above all how can we be confident. Doing part-time jobs can make us know more about the society and teach us how to be engaged in it. It is the golden time to learn new things at this age, especially this process of learning is like bury the seeds from which we can harvest a lot in four years when we formally enter the society. On the other hand, doing part-time jobs can teach students a very important lesson, namely how to make money and how hard to make money. For a long period, most student may have been accustomed to asking money from their parents. It cannot do any help to shape a correct attitude toward money. Whereas, part-time jobs can solve the problem. Through the work, students know it impressively that No pains, no gains. And they can also enjoy their own gains. Seeing their own efforts paid off, it must be a great joy. So, from where I stand, it is quite important for college students to do part-time jobs, which is of great help to their life, both present and future.
