Teen smoking is on the rise more and more. And teens are smoking much more than ever. Teen smoking affects everyone, not just the teens that do it. If teens don't stop smoking, they should get cancer and die. That could affect a whole entire generation. Also, secondhand smoke could be a problem too. A couple solutions to this problem are to stop the media promoting and to educate teens about smoking and how it's bad for you. The public image of smoking is making teens think it is cool to smoke. Part of making the public image of smoking better is to ban the ads on billboards, and in magazines or anything else that advertises smoking. The teens see those ads and see the people with lots of luxuries like money and friends in the ads and think that if they smoke, they will get those things. If they stop those ads, teens will not think that smoking will help their self image. Another solution would be to stop apparel that promoting smoking. The teens see people wearing those shirts, hats and things and they think that they'll be mature and respected if they start smoking. If the tobacco Companies stop the promotion of smoking on apparel, then they won't see it as something cool. Finally, the action smoking on TV and in movies make smoking look good. If the action heroes and actors stop smoking, then when kids look up to them they promoting smoking. Not as many people will do it.
