Part-time work is an activity that can help a person in everyday life even in the future. For example if someone has done his part-time job at the young, he can easily blend in to his original work later and already accustomed to work, other than getting the experience he can also get extra money for himself. Many part-time job that can be done as become employees of restaurants or shop keeping. Usually part-time work is done during the holidays, but some also work part time during college years. Part-time job could also add insight. In part-time work is a good idea if the same field of profession you can do well in college because it can lead to increased insight into the world of jobs. Part-time work also forms the character of a person starts from the leadership, or team work in a world of work Therefore especially young men and women do not just stay quiet when having a lot of free time. They need use the free time it was to work part time because we can develop the characters and also add insight as well and experience. I believe that part time job is necessary for college students because the experience they get will be useful for them later.
