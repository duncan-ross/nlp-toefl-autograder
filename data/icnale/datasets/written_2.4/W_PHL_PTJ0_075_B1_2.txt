Some schoolmates I know have part-time jobs. Most of them don't. Personally, I don't have a part-time job, but I still think having one is important; which is why I plan to apply for one in the near future. Having a part-time job has its ups and downs. The main downside is the student's difficulty in handling a very time pressing schedule. But once the student is able to handle it, the rewards can be very satisfying. For one, it puts a good amount of green papers in your wallet. And with that amount, it makes your financial responsibilities a little easier to handle. Another is the experience you gain from having a part-time job—I mean, yeah, it's obvious that part-time jobs for students are no brainer jobs, but it gives you an idea on how the business industry operates. When you get out of college, you won't be the work-virgin that's asking obvious questions all the time. And last, with experience comes confidence. Given that you've used your time wisely when you were at your part-time job, when you get a real job, you won't be the guy who's always walking hunchbacked in the hallway. You'll be one of those who stand tall and walks with confidence on the experience that you have. Choosing to have a part-time job should be made freely. You're going to have to be willing to be exhausted when you go home at night and still open your books to study for your next class the following day. You're going to have to make sacrifices, but in the end, the rewards will be great.
