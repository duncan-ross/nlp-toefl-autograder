I don't think it is "important" for college students to have a part-time job, but it could be a good and useful experience to learn. Before one being hired for a part-time job, he/she needs to know how to search a one, like surfing on the internet, the wanted ads in the store, or introduced by friends or families. This is an experience. One can also learn that what kind of jobs is suitable for him/her how's the possibility of being hired, and so on. When one is hired for a part-time job, one can earn money for himself/herself; this is indeed an "income" not from parents. Other than money, there are also many things to study and to gain. If it's a clerk in drink-selling shop, one can learn how to make a cup of drink by adding different fluids in a specific ratio, how to deal with customers if they have special needs. Or if it's a teaching assistant in cram school, one can use his/her knowledge of English or math to help students in learning. When students have learned the concept or solved the questions in exam, he/she would also be very happy in this process. Part-time jobs can provide different experiences besides money. However, one can also spend the same time doing other things, like clubs in school, courses like learning language, camps helping residents living in distant areas, etc. If one is still learning, his/her college life will not be meaningless. So I say it is a good experience to have a part-time job, but not a necessary thing to do in college life, especially if one is not short of money.
