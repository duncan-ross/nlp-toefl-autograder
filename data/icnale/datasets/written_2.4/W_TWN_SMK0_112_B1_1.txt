Smoking is not a good habit for all ages of people, but there are still many people just can't quit it. There are some reasons I think why they can't quit it. First, they have smoked for a long time and it becomes a regular movement in their daily lives. Second, some of them think smoking is a charming behavior and a real man should know how to smoke. Third, some people think only if they smoke can they make friends and be more convenient to communicate with others on business. But they don't see the shortages of smoking. For example, they have to pay much money on buying cigarettes. In addition, smoking will hurt their own and the surrounding people' health. Thus, our government starts to make laws to prevent those smoking lovers smoking in a public place. They can't smoke inside or outside if there are more 2 people. By the way, there are many ways to help them quit smoking. We can find some products which can help people decrease the desire to smoke. Also, we can get some information from the hospitals. All in all, smoking is not good for us. We should quit smoking and also urge our friends not to smoke anymore.
