Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is a bad habit. It is full of harmful effects and affects the individual by causing illness such as cancer and lung problems. By allowing smoking at restaurant, smokers have less of reason to not smoke and there is a higher probability and a tendency for them to take a stick. This leads to more health problems for the smoker and therefore is indirectly causing harm to the individual. Secondly, there is also the possibility of second hand smoke whereby innocent consumers at the restaurants will be exposed to the harmful effects of smoking when they are not smoking themselves. This is because the harmful smoke from smoking can spread to another place and in this case another whereby other consumers are sitting. Therefore, they are breathing in the second hand smoke. This leads to harmful impacts to their body. However, there is a benefit of allowing smoking in restaurant. For certain hardcore smokers who can't live without smoking, they will eventually still find places to smoke. Therefore by banning smoking, these people will just find another place to smoke. This may instead lead to a decrease in people eating at the restaurant and hence a decrease in the revenue earned. There will be less profits and in some cases, the restaurant might even have a loss. They may have to retrench some workers and there may be social impacts that result from an increase in unemployment rate. Hence, in conclusion, banning smoking has its benefits and adverse effects. However, the adverse effects outweigh the benefits since benefits are very limiting. The smokers eventually will still have to obtain food and perhaps go to restaurant to eat eventually.
