Whether smoking should be completely banned at restaurants has certainly risen a controversy. Recently in Taiwan, our legislative Yuan has passed a law in order to ban smoking at restaurants and other public-open places. I personally support the law with my whole heart and strongly believe that smoking should be banned. In numerous medical reports, many evidence suggested that not only cigarette addicts but also people that breathe in the polluted air may die from respiration system related cancers. To be specific, people may be forced to die in an unpleasant way just because other's bad habit. I think anyone with consciousness will not allow this to happen. Furthermore, with fumes filling the atmosphere of a restaurant, harmful particles can possibly land on our dishes and travel all the way through our digestive systems. Some people might cough or sneeze when inhaling the fumes and thus spreading viruses or bacterium into the air. People go to restaurants to enjoy the great food and happy time, not to tolerate other's selfishness and get sick. Maybe those who hold different perspectives may not agree with my statement. However, I think for the sake of everyone's health, smoking should be banned not only at restaurants but every inches of land.
