I can't agree this title anymore, and I am a hate smoking, so I very agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At first, the restaurants is opening area not anyone's, so we can't do anything we want to do! As well as, smoking is not personal heath that can be hit other one not just the restaurants which is anywhere opening. From my family, anyone do not smoking I have handle the no smoking condition, so I can't acept any about smoking and my family also hate them. As little as my age, my mother teach us can't smoking that is bad and hit our heath and others. I know the smoking can cause many disease not just hit lump and the lump could become bark and in the end maybe full water that is not good felling. We stay in restaurants not just min time, maybe we buy something go out spending 5 m maybe we eat in there spending 1 hr, so we could input many bad thing. If this title can really to do, I think many people is happy as me, just in restaurants we can free! So, I am very agree.
