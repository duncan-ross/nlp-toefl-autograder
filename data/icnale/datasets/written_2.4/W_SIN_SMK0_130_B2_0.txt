Being a non-smoker, the natural stand would tend to deviate towards a complete ban of smoking. However, a significant proportion of our country's taxes are derived from the tobacco industry. Banning only bring about revenue loss and generates unhappiness within the affected population. Smoking should be not entirely banned at all the restaurants in Singapore, lest the smoking corner. An isolated room could be allocated to provide smokers with an alternative, besides, smokers tend to show less concern with inhaling second-hand smoke as they are doing it concurrently while smoking. We achieve both objectives of creating a smoke-free environment for the health-conscious and a bother-free environment for the smokers. The basis behind the suggestion is to induce social-awkwardness within the smokers, quitting must start from within. While it may seem like an unfriendly proposal, we must realize that these smokers possess the ability to control their habit and stand align being considerate in a social manner. Non-smokers have to bite the bullet and tolerate their smoker friends and counterparts. We do not ban smoking completely in lieu of preventing social unrest, but we strive to create a more considerate society. An entire ban would also result inconvenience for the smokers, they are limited to few eateries and this creates a double-edged sword situation. Restaurants will lose business, which is undesirable, a majority of Malays are smokers, picking up smoking from young. Muslim restaurants will fold up in a matter of months, smokers would be forced to take-away their food and soon be irked by this practice. While banning smoking is beneficial for the general health in Singapore, social unrest stemming from a single race could result in conflicts due to multi-racial unhappiness. Quitting is from within, not condemning.
