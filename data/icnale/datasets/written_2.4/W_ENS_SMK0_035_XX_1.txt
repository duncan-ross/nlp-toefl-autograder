I disagree with smoking being banned in restaurants, whether it be in Japan, the U. S., or any other country in the world. Smokers have a right to smoke at restaurants, but unlike some other inconsiderate smokers, I don't think we have the right to smoke at every restaurant. Some restaurants market their cuisines more towards the adult crowd, and as such an establishment, I feel that smoking is not only appropriate but rather in an enhancement of the mood and atmosphere. Conversely, family restaurants where there will often be small children should be off limits to smoking. Finally, restaurants that have no particular target group for their clients should separate their facilities into a smoking and a nonsmoking section. This way, everyone has a restaurant to which they can go comfortably, and there are also restaurants where both smokers and non-smokers can enjoy themselves. I don't have much experience with Japanese culture, but from what I do know, I know that they stress harmony and relationships and all aspects of life, so the solution would seem to be very fit for their use. Colorado, my home state, has already banned smoking in restaurants, so I would hate to see the rest of the world go this way.
