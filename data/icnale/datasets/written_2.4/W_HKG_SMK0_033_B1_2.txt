Undoubtedly, to the benefits of the smokers, the banning of smoking in restaurants would serve as a warning of care from the government and the public. To the non-smokers, the law means the protection of their rights from breathing second-hand smoke. In making our decision, we should take account of weights of both sides to voice our support to ban smoking in restaurants. The fact – smoking can cause cancer – is well documented and well-known for years in our society; the sad fact – no one seems to care – is so common in Hong Kong. The owners of the restaurants give one reason: the ban scares off their customers (smokers). Therefore, their other customers (non-smokers) have to accept breathing smoke passively. In the meantime, the vicious circle goes on. A chronic smoker might go into coughing and spitting. Some might up in hospital. Some might pass away with cancer. The non-smokers might for the medical bill to treat for their allergies due to inhalation of foul air. However, the smokers might believe smoking as their right of enjoying their time – even having dinner in the restaurant. On the other hand, the owners of the restaurants might believe their rights to run their business. Who has the authority to mend the wrong? It seems there is no answer. Our outcry for the protection of the restaurants from smoking is ignored by our leader – the government and its official members. In fact, it does not even protect our health and the public benefits. In all, no matter what, I would say: Ban smoking in the restaurants!
