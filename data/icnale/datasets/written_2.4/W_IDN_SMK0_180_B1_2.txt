Many people still smoking even though they know that it is not good for health. They burn their cigarettes in many public places, including restaurants. They do not realize that their habit gives disadvantages to other people. Smoke of cigarettes is compounds of poison that can make people in the restaurants suffer from many diseases, such as lung cancer and pharynx infections. It can also reduce quality of the food and drink served there, because the smoke flies through the air and stick into the food. It is also impolite for us to smoke in front of other people who have their lunch. Further, it is easier for the people who have their lunch at a restaurant where other people smoke, to get disease from smoke than people who meet other people smoking at the bus stop, because usually when people have lunch or dinner, they open their mouth more frequently, so it is easier for the poisonous cigarette smoke to enter their body and start infect their lung cells. In my opinion, smoking should be banned, especially in the restaurants, because it disturbs others, make people unhealthy, make food served there become not good for health, and it has no specific benefit.
