I agree this opinion. I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Recently, smoking is banned in public place. Especially, it trend to prohibit smoking in a place where gathering many people. Stop smoking in public place will be common sence. I think smoking at all the restaurants has two problems. Firstly, smoking erase smell and flaver of meel. Smell and flaver of meel are important components of meel. Smell and flaver of meel relate taste of meel. So, smoking breaks good taste of meel. Secondly, smoking causes sub smoking. Sub smoking injures surrounded people. There are many young and old people at restaurants. Smoker should think about sub smoking. Smoking is no good for non smoker. To separate smoking and no smoking is spread recently. However, it is busy to separate smoking and non smoking completely. Because, it is impossible to separate air and smoke completely. Many smoker might insist that smoking is public permitted right. That is true. But, I insist that the right of refuse smoking is as much as important the right of smoking. Of course, I don't insist that smoking is illegal. I want smoker to protect these two rights in public place.
