We can see people with a cigarette at every corner of the world, and many governments have taken measures to deal with the problem. There are several reasons to do so. At first, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and health of people surrounds us. Some experts say that second-hand smoking is more harmful than smoking. So people smoke will do harm to non-smokers in the restaurants. It is unfair for non-smokers. So it is reasonable to ban the smoking in public places. In addition smoking shows a person's attitude. If a person smokes in the restaurant; it means he doesn't respect other people's feeling. Many non-smokers feel very uncomfortable when they smell the smoke in the restaurants. What is more, when someone is smoking around a pregnant woman, it can be very dangerous for the baby. Although many smokers say that banning smoking in the restaurants is a influence towards human's freedom and privacy, in fact, facing the death which is caused by smoking or second-hand smoking, the freedom and privacy mean nothing at all. But people do have the right to choose whether they want to have this kind of lifestyle or not. So it is really hard to ban smoking completely in all places in the country. But restaurants are public places. Thus, what we should do now is to ban smoking in the restaurants for all people's health. In a word, it is correct to ban smoking in all the restaurants because smoking is only a bad thing.
