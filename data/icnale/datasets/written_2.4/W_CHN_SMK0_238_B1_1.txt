As we all know, smoking is bad for our health, but most men and some women even some young person still smoke. Most smokers smoke for calming down themselves, but young person do this just for being cool. And there is a big problem of smoking in public places which is that smoking can not only effect smoker's health but also be bad for others'. So I think it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to survey, people who smoke indirectly will be harmed much more than smoker himself, and smoking more will cause cancer. So people who smoke in public places are threatening the other people's life safety. It is equal to crime! When one is smoking while others are having their dinner, the smoke will fill the whole restaurant and at the same time, people who are eating will swallow much smoke and it is very bad for their health. On the other hand, the smoke will destroy the environment of the restaurant and reduce the customers' appetite. There is another problem which is of great importance, the cigarette ends that are not extinguished completely in the public will likely cause a fire. It's very dangerous. Above are my opinions. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
