I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because having a part-time job will enable a student to experience what real life is like, and not be molly-coddled in the safe academic world. The point of going to college is to get an education, while academic knowledge is important, street smarts should not be neglected too. A part-time job is a good way for students to be more sophisticated about how the world works. Part-time jobs let the students earn pocket money too, which is a good way for students to learn about finance and also, lessen the financial burden on parents. Therefore, with the two main benefits explained above, gaining more experience about the world and earning pocket money at the same time, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, the statement is not clear whether it is important for students to have a part-time job at all times or just sometimes. The latter position makes more sense. While having a job will no doubt benefit a student in terms of expanding his or her horizons, the basic duty of a student is still to academics. Hence it is better if the student only works at a part-time job during school holidays and the less-busy time of school, but focus on studies during exams.
