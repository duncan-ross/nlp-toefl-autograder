I don't think that part-time work is important for college students. I also don't think that work is important for adults. We were put here on this earth to serve and worship the Lord Jesus Christ, and everything that gets in the way of that is just a waste of time. It is only a matter of time until he comes back to save all of us, and the people who have been frittering away their time an ungodly pursuits will not ascend to heaven. This is what I was taught to believe. But since I have come to college, I have learned that some of the things that my family taught me may have been wrong. The more I learn in college the more I have come to realize that whether are not you are a religious person, you do have time you're on the earth, and you have to use that time to do good things. I think that if you do that, then you can go to heaven any ways. It has taken a long time for me to learn about this, and has taken a long time for me to shake the bonds of my religious upbringing. So, now that I have a new perspective, I think that it is good for college students to have a part-time job.
