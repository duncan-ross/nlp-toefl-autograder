Smoking has gradually become a common habit to somebody in the society. The government constantly promote that smoking is harmful to our bodies, but there are still many people don't want to quit it. To keep air clean, then the authority concerned make a law that people cannot smoke in public, but the effect seems to have not been good. The signs can be saw in many restaurants. In my opinion, I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because it violate the right of people who like smoking. Everyone has its own habits and the things what they like to do. Although the habit, smoking, does harm to them and others, restaurants are supposed to set places that can smoke for people who love smoking. The best way is to set the smoking section outdoor, it will not influence the atmosphere and air in restaurants and it can make addicts more comfortable. Smoking is not a good habit, and it is also hard to quit. That is just as everyone can't give up the thing what they like immediately, it need much time to change. We can't promise when people love smoking will have desire to get rid of this or decrease the times, but we should give those addicts some spaces before they quit it.
