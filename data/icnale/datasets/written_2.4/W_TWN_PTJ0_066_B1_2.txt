I think it is important for university students to have the experiences of working in part-time. Working before graduated from school can provide a wide perspective of life and a right thought about using money and the value of money. Also, it can train our minds, patience and bodies. Make us be strong and thankful for all we have already had. We can know what kind of environment and treat we will face when we work for a full-time job from working for a part-time job. Besides, we can learn social skills and grow the ability of coping with difficulties. We would understand that this big society is more variable and complex than we thought and been told. The money we earned by ourselves will be used more carefully than those getting from parents absolutely. Having different part-time jobs can let us understand that which job is really fit us and we want to work. Though part-time jobs are generally hard, challenge and exhausting to us, may also have some unfair treat, we should try for an experience, a chance to change us to a mature adult. See the short of ourselves clearly and learn the good personalities from others. Go and get the part-time job now!
