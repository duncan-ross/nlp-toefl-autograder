Smoking refers to the lighting of cigarettes. Smoking should be completely banned because of its harmful effects on other diners who are more conscious of the detrimental effects of cigarette smoke than the smoker himself. Not only is cigarette smoke harmful to our health, it leaves an unpleasant smell on others around the smoker and may be irritating to other diners. This is an extremely inconsiderate behaviour of the smoker and thus smoking should be banned in restaurants. Moreover, lighting up in restaurants would deter other diners from dining there and thus, affect the business of the restuarants. As restaurants are family-friendly venues, young diners would be affected by the smokers as they are more susceptible to negative influences around them. This would worsen the issue of younger smokers in the country which is already rather serious. Banning smoking will also deter the smokers themselves from lighting up, playing a significant role in reducing health risk they are exposing themselves to. Banning it will also show the government's determination in stemming out the harmful act of smoking, sending a strong message to current and potential smokers. Thus I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in this country.
