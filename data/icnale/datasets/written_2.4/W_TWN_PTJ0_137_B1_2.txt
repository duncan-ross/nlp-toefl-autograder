In my perspective, it is truly vital for college students to have a part-time job. There are several points why I approve college students to have a part-time job. First, doing the part-time job can expand our horizons rather than limit our tunnel vision in the small campus. Second, it can strengthen our interaction ability with different kinds of people. Third, it can also accumulate our occupation experience as well as make us get used to the future occupation environment gradually. Fourth, it makes us realize that earning money is not an easy task. Last but not least, it shapes us to be more independent; after all we have to make a living by ourselves in the near future. It is no doubt that there are so many advantages when doing the part-time job. However it is pretty important that doing the part-time job shouldn't affect our schoolwork. When we do it, it definitely reduces our time and energy. We can't give up our schoolwork. We should strike a balance between the part-time job and the schoolwork. If we can both strengthen ourselves by doing the part-time job and have good performance in schoolwork, then we indeed create a win-win situation. Wish everyone have a golden harvest!
