Considering that restaurants are places where people relax themselves and enjoy good food, smoking, with its odours and negative health impacts, should indeed be banned in all restaurants. In today's increasingly capitalist world, people tend to have less and less time for relaxation. This is especially true in developed countries. For those working in developed countries, other than the time spent sleeping, most of the de-stressing happens across meal tables. Mealtimes are moments where people take break from work and recharge them for, most unfortunately, more work. Given the value of these mealtimes, it would indeed be prudent for smoking to be banned in restaurants. Besides the widely known hazards to health, the odour resulting from cigarette smoking would most definitely be a nuisance to any non-smoker trying to enjoy a meal in a restaurant. One might argue that smokers have the right to enjoy their mealtimes, and thus should be allowed to smoke over meal tables in the restaurant too. However, smoking is essentially detached from the act of eating, and thus could be done outside of restaurant when the smokers are done eating. This way, not only would non-smoker not be affected, smokers would still be able to enjoy the meal and their cigarette.
