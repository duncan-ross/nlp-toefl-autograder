Even though smoking has been a historical part of many cultures worldwide for many years, it is time for change. Long gone are the days when smoking should be seen as fashionable or cute because it no longer is, if it ever was at all. The medical evidence that has been gathered over the years has shown clearly that there is nothing cute about dying from smoking and I have never seen anyone with emphysema who looked fashionable to me. The jury has long been in on this one folks, it's time to cease and desist. There is nothing good that can be said about smoking at all, but we hear an awful lot of bad stuff. I am sure that if many of us were to think long and hard, we might recall somebody that we knew who had cancer, heart stroke or some other disease which they contracted from smoking and I don't believe that if we picture that person before their death or illness, that we would say that they looked fashionable or cute either. The tobacco companies continue to get richer while the people continue to get sicker. Time for a change and the time is now.
