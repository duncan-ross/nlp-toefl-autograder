Smoking is a common activity for adults and teenagers. For adults, smoking is a past-time even if they know what could happen to them. Today, teenagers smoke because it is the trend. They think that if they don't smoke, they won't be cool or would get left out. Based on my experience, some smokers that I know learned smoking from their friends because they were pressured to do it. And as time passed by, they got used to it and got addicted more and more each day they smoked. Another reason why teenagers smoke is curiosity. Since we are young we tend to try new things. Because of our curiosity, we try smoking even without knowing what could happen to us. Some get influenced by family, advertisements and especially by the media Restaurant is a place for people to eat and socialize. They go to restaurants to satisfy themselves with food when they're hungry. It is really dangerous for people to smoke in restaurants because of health risks to every people who might inhale the smoke. It can affect the food that we are eating. The smoke might give bacteria to the food and drinks we intake that might cause sickness to every people and also destroy the good environment that the restaurant is located to. I believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants because for me it should have a right place to smoke not in a restaurant. I personally hate smoking especially in restaurants I don't feel well when I inhale smokes. It's really not good to the health of every people. In a restaurant different people are inside of it adults, teenagers, toddlers and I personally have care for them. If smoking can't be banned in a restaurant at least put a smoking area for every restaurant so it would be fair.
