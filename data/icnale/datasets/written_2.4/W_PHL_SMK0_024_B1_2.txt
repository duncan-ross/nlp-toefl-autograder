I think that they should not banned smoking in restaurants in the country first of all this is a democratic country you are given the freedom to do what you want without stepping over others rights. Secondly if smoking is banned the cigarette industry in Philippines will be affected in bad way a bigger problem arises. Instead they should designate an area where customers who smokes can still smoke and other customers who doesn't smoke can still enjoy their stay. The national or the local government should help the business establishment in this endeavour because after all there are still more people who don't smoke rather than those who smoke. In that way customers will go to restaurants without the thought in their mind that they wouldn't enjoy because of the discomfort due to some customers is smoking. If there will be more customers who will go to restaurants their revenue and tax collection would increase. We all know that cigarette smoking is dangerous to our health and the government is spending millions for the subsidy for the hospitalization of smokers but banning smoking is not the way to stop people from smoking. The government should increase the tax for cigarettes and other vices and they should implement a program or seminar for teenagers because this is the stage that you want to try everything due to different reasons like peer pressure and curiosity. Once you're in to smoking it's almost impossible to quit because you know what it taste like and how it feels. You will only stop smoking once you feel its effects that's why the government should not target the smokers because it like talking to a wall because there is a little chance that they would listen. -
