I feel that having a part-time job is advantageous in many ways and college students should be advised to take up one. Part-time work can potentially equip students with many skills which books cannot give us. However, I do not feel that part-time work is for everyone, especially students who are struggling with school work. Firstly, part-time jobs teaches one to manage time better. As one is required to put in a certain number of hours at work, the amount of time left for other things are reduced. To be able to manage work and studies well would be a challenge. By taking up a job, one would be forced to learn good time management skills. Secondly, a part-time job allows one to better appreciate the things we have. Many have criticized today's youths for taking many things for granted. By taking up paid work, one could better understand the hard work behind every cent earned. In addition, one may even learn how to manage one's finances. Since a set amount of money is paid after working, one can learn how to spend wisely and save up for a rainy day. Having said that, it does not mean that part-time work is suitable for everyone. As students, the priority should always be to do well in studies. Those who are struggling with passing examinations should spend more time to revise instead of taking up a part-time job as working can be quite exhausting. In conclusion, I feel that part-time work should be encouraged, but not at the expense of school work. As students, we should always ensure that studies come first. For those who are coping well with their studies, it may not be a bad idea to consider taking up a part-time job as it would be very beneficial.
