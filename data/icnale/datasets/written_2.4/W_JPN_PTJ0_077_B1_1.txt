Part-time job is important activity for university students. It is four reasons for this opinion. First, it is a great chance for university students to experience society system and to advance communication skills. Students have little chance to work and to talk many people or to attend society rule if he/she only study in university. This is the practice to communicate with people after graduation. Second, we, students join club activity and have friends. We need a little money to communicate with them. I have money from parents. But that money is for study or for food. I think I shouldn't use the money for hobby. We should earn money if we play with friends. Third, I would like to learn special skills of many jobs. For example, typing register, cooking, operating machines, or PC skill. I would like to be an engineer, so it is important to learn operating machines and PC. Finaly, part time job makes us healthy because it is good exercise for our body. We, students have little chances to play sports in university. We are able to use body in part time job. From these reasons, I think Part time job is good activity
