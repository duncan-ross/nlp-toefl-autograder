I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is not only can earn some pocket money for self but also accumulate social experience for the future. Most of us have given pocket money by our parents since we were children. As we grow up, the desire is getting bigger and bigger. However, parents will not give us everything we want, the thing only we can do is try to make some money by ourselves. I think it is also a good way to prove that "We are adult". Most of people might think when we graduate from school and it is the time we have to face unemployment. "The chance is for seekers. " That is to say, if we need a chance, we have to create it. The best way is have as mach practical experience as we can. Part-time job is a good choice that we can learn a lot of experience from. It is really a wonderful experience to have a part-time job when we are still students. Especially, we can learn lots of that we may never known from cold books even our professors. That is a good way for us to associate with colleagues or customers. Everyone should get it a try!
