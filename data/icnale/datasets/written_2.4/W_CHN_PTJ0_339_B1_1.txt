Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs, which is criticised by many people for affecting academic study to some degree. Despite the disadvantage, I still hold the view that college students benefit a lot more from this experience. To begin with, taking a part-job helps college students make their first step into the real society. Every one ought to work for the society sooner or later. Early education equips us with primary knowledge while colleges act as a transition period, transforming us from students to social individuals. It's an appropriate and efficient way to aware us of the society and realize the transition. Besides, getting a job early helps us find what we really like. Look at Dell, one of the most successful businessmen in the world. He took up fixing computers during college, resulting in his leaving school and starting his own career. Jobs are what we are going to devote our whole lifetime to. Therefore, we should get prepared so as to choose one we are crazy about. In addition, working experience during college time adds to the possibility of being successfully signed by a prominent corporation. Take my sister as an example. With ample working experience in college, she was picked out from a pile of talented employees. When competing on the fierce employment battle, part-time job experience is a powerful weapon. Opponents say that having a part-time job may have a bad impact on one's academic grades. However, grade is not the single standard by which a person should be judged. It is the all-round quality that really counts. To conclude, I stand at the back of getting a part-time job during college. It is interesting, beneficial and worthwhile.
