Yes, I feel that smoking should be completely banned in Singapore restaurants. When compared to other countries such as the Netherlands where smoking weed is actually legal in some restaurants because the restaurant owners make a business out of weed and the customers that smoke it, I feel that it is justified to ban smoking in Singapore restaurants. This is because there is no such thing as smoking weed here. Also, it is because breathing in second hand smoke is really extremely unhealthy. I do not like the smell of second hand smoke because it gives me a headache and a stomachache. If I was at a restaurant and someone started smoking, I would be very irritated and hence be unable to enjoy my meal happily. A meal at a restaurant is also not cheap, so I think that I would be at the losing end if someone who smokes ruined the enjoyment of my meal. That being said, I also think that putting smokers into a smoker zone in hawker centres is a good move. Although the smoke sometimes wafts over to the non smoking zone, I can live with it because I usually finish my food fast in hawker centres. Also, I can always get up and move to another area where there is not much smokers or simply just order my food to be a takeaway. This is different from restaurants where you are made to sit at one exact spot throughout.
