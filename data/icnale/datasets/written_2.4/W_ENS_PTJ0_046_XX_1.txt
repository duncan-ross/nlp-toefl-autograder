A part-time job is a great way for any student to expand their skill set. This is an important part of developing as a college student anyway, so I think is a great idea for any college student to have a part-time job. Part-time work can teach are many lessons that you would never have the chance to learn if you spend all your time just doing the assigned class work. For instance, although a busy college class schedule can teach time management, there is nothing like the demands of several different activities to really hot new skills. Also, students can gain an appreciation for financial management and they can learn about what it really means to be a working adult in the modern society. I know that when I first entered college, I was somewhat immature, in my first part-time job taught me a lot about responsibility in what it means to be an adult. I would never have been able to stay in school pursuing an advanced degree if I have not learned how to work hard and manage myself effectively. Last, the money that students can gain from a part-time job is usually enough to cover any personal expenses that may have.
