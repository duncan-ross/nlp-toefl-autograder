As we all know, smoking is harmful to smokers and the persons who have to sit by. However, is it necessary to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants? I don't think so. After all, smoking is already a habit of many people. If the government suddenly ban it at all the restaurants, there seem to be significant impact on the people being hooked to smoking. We can't simply ban smoking only because we know it's bad to the health. Also should we probe the reason hided behind the phenomenon. Many people regard smoking as an effective way to alleviate the pressure. Others think smoking can bring them the inspiration. And in some places, offering a cigarette to the person you meet show your respect. With more and more people gathering in restaurants, if they are not permitted smoking, they are likely to feel embarrassed. Suppose people can't smoke in all restaurants, some smoker may intend to choose having meal at home. The number of customer may become small. this is the last thing the restaurants want to see. And it's not good for the economy. So still allowing smoking at some restaurants seems to be proper. To protect children, they can't get in.
