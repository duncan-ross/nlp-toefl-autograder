I have been employed as a part-time student helper in school for about six months now. I help out in the Publishing Technology Center to the photographer and student helper for the Student Affairs Office by doing different tasks from time to time. I think that it is important for university students to have a part-time job as this may act as their first work experience (if they do not have any), before going out in the society. Although having a part-time job make take away some students' precious studying time, there is much to learn from having a part-time job. As for me, because I have a passionate interest for photography, being a helper to the photographer has allowed me to learn a lot of skills that I would not be able to learn outside. It allows us to be involved in this'extra curriculum' other than just academic. If the job is within our field of study, it is even better as we would have a head start in our future job than other applicants who do not have this experience. We also get to experience the working conditions of an actual workplace. Students could also learn to be independent by earning some money as their allowance rather than taking from their parents. I would strongly recommend university students to have a part-time job.
