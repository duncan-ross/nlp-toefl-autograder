As more and more people have realized the importance of their quality of life, the issue of health has received increasing public attention. In my opinion, the government should establish a high-quality health system for the citizens. There are some reasons for this as follows. The first reason to be taken into account is being based on the premise that all men are created equal, which is generally accepted belief in most countries. Just like equal pay for equal work, uniform quality and quantity of health should be given to all citizens, who are believed to be born equal. Similarly, health care can be compared to justice, which is dispensed impartially by judges to all people, without reference to their social backgrounds. Therefore, everyone stands equal under health care system that is supposed to be provided by the government. On the other hand, smoking is bed for people's health. Both smokers and people around the smokers may get lung cancer. Therefore, smokers should respect non-smokers and not to make a dangerous environment for everyone. To conclude, health care is an issue that all governments cannot afford to avoid in their day-to-day running of the country. So, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
