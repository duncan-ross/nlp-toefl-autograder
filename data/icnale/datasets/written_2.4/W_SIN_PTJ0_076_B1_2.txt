In the present age, it is common for people from all walks of life to have a job. While the reason that drove them to attain a job may differ, this phenomenon is one that would stay. The issue of whether it is crucial for college students --- young persons within the age of 18 to 25 years old who are pursuing an education career in a tertiary institute --- to be employed to work for a relatively short period of time is indeed contentious. This essay shall attempt to illustrate that while working part-time benefits the student by allowing one to gain experience and become financially independent, it is not without its limitations, where is saps one's free time. It is important for college students to attain a part-time job. Through a part-time job, the student would inculcate valuable hard and soft skills. For instance, there would be enhanced communications between the student and one's employer and client that helps one improve on one's interpersonal skills. Technical skills specific to the job could also be quickly picked up by the student, equipping one with more knowledge that could create an all rounded individual. Furthermore, one would be able to become financially independent and learn to manage one's finances at a younger age. Hence, attaining a part-time job is important as it provides one with a range of skills that mere studying cannot achieve. Nonetheless, dissidents may argue that working is not important as the main focus of a college student is to study. Instead, critics may feel that working deprives one of leisure time, and in some cases, may even result in one being too busy, resulting in one's inability to concentrate on one's academics. This would be detrimental to the college student.
