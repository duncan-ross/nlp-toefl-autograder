I agree that important for college students to have a part-time job because students need to use a lot of money to spend in university. They get some money from their parent but it is not enough. So I think it has a lot of factor to make college students use money too much. I will show you some factor that why college students use a lot of money. First is food. In university, we have more time. Someday, we study in the morning and someday in the afternoon. If we study in the morning, we have breakfast and go to study. After class, we can buy some food from shop in university. If we have class in the afternoon, we can get up late and then we have lunch before go to study. In university has a lot of shop so we can buy food, snack, drink, etc. all the time. It make student pay money all time. Second is travel. We have free time in university. We stay at the dormitory and long time we will come back our hometown. We can travel on the weekend with friends, boyfriend or girlfriend. And in summer, student can travel to far away because they don't have classes and their parent don't know. The last is hang out. Around university has a lot of pub to travel. Student can go and hang out with friends. They have new society at pub and they will use alt of money to drink. All of this is the factor from me that why college students use a lot of money and they will have part-time job. Part-time job makes student get some money to spend !
