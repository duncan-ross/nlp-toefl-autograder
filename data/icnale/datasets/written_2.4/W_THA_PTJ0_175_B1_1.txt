It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, money is very important for our life. Everybody spends money to pay everything, no matter car, home, food, technology, medicine, education, etc. If you have no money, you don't have a comfortable in your life. Moreover, education is very important for everybody. Especially the modern people like me. If we have enough education, we will get the comfortable in our life. Although, I get an enough education, somebody doesn't have opportunity to study. They don't have opportunity to study, since they have no money to study. When I go to study in the university, I think I have to buy many things. These are example about things that I have to buy or pay; uniforms, textbook, computer, dormitory, the internet per month, cost of living in daily life, cost of register, etc. My parents have to pay for me about 80, 000 baht in the first month. However, I spend a lot of money; it's very important things in my life. My parents pay for me about 5, 000 bath per month, but I think it's enough for me. I never buy the brand name, since I think it's not important for me. I never eat food that so expensive. So, I think the part-time job isn't important for college students.
