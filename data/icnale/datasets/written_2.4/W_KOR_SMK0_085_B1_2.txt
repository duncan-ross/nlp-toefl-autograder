Recently, many people have been suffering from smoke. It means that everyone exposures smoke including babies and teens. Therefore, I'd like to say that smoking should completely be banned all restaurants throughout the country. This is because people who are used to smoke can't stay healthy when eating meals with smoking. To begin with, some people who used to smoke are eating meals with smoking. In other words, non-smokers are not free for smoking. Generally speaking, having meals with smoking is brutal to every people. It even causes lung cancer for people who used to smoke. Also, it might be hard to keep staying healthy. As an example, one of my friends is not a smoker. However, he often get symptom of minor cold even when it's summer. One day, he dropped by a clinic. At that time, a doctor said that you've got a minor lung cancer. It was strange to him because he didn't try to smoke at all. From that day on, he avoids having meals outside. In conclusion, I strongly support on the idea that smoking should be banned all restaurants in the country. Eating meals without smoking seems like everybody's desire. People who both used to smoke and are used to smoking cannot keep their personal healthy, as long as smoking shouldn't be banned in all restaurants throughout the country.
