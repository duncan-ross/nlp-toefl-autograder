I think that the college students need a part time job indeed. Because college students need more experience before they are members of society and they must do more experiences. Of course study is very important to the college student, but the college student must know the outside of society and must experience. When I was twenty, I first get a part-time job in front of my college. It was coffee shop. I haven't known about coffee, so I really worried about that can I do well? I tried to do well. About six months I nearly worked every day except the weekend. At first I was so hard that quit a part time job. But I thought that if I quit a part time job now I can't do anything after graduate the college. So I tried to work hard more. And then I was accustomed to a part time job. I knew about coffee and I learned patience. I realized how I can treat the guests. It will be precious experience in society. I will continue a part time job until graduating the college. I want every college student works a part time job and then they get a precious experience. In conclusion, I recommend a part time job.
