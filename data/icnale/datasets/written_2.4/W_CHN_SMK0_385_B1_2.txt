Now a considerable number of people(including some teenages)smoke, and many smoke heavily although they admit smoking do harm to their health. And it's bad not only for themselves, but everyone around them----According to a research, only 20% of harmful substance is taken up by smokers, and the other 80% is absorbed by individuals around them, thus an interesting noun is created: second hand smoking, meaning that people absorb smokes although they don't actually smoke. It is unfair indeed, and more than that, when you smell someone smoke in a restaurant, the unpleasant feeling may reduce your eppetite heavily----the restaurant manage won't be happy, too. Because they sell less food!Also, it's bad for smokers:they get more chances to smoke, and the more they smoke, the worse their health will be, and the greater desire they will have, making it more difficult to quit smoking. Some restaurants set a smoking area which is used by smokers only, but the problem is that smoke isn't solid standing stablely at one place, thus the situation won't change radically. So it's high time to ban smoking, especially in restaurants. Scientists tell us it's possible to quit smoking, all the smokers need is a strong mind and supervision. If all restaurants banned smoking with a firm hand, the number of smokers would be sharply reduced, and benefits would be amazing:an ocean of money would be saved, and the saved money could be invested to more meaningful areas such as education and health care;people would be heathier, and public health system would have lighter burden;air condition would change better as well as rubbish would be less; there would be less robbers and our society would be more harmonious.... This ban will especially do good to teenages. Raised in a enviroment fewer people smoke, teenages will have less opportunity to smoke, and smoking won't be a trend among them, and as a result, teenages will face a healthier future.
