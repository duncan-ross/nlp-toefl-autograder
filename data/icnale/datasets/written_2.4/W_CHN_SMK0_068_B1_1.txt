I don't suppose that it's a wise idea to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. But I'm in favor of banning smoking at some restaurants. On one hand. It's of great significance of banning smoking. Firstly, as we all know, smoking for a long time will change people's health; it might lead to lung cancer and other diseases. Secondly, you may feel annoyed when people surrounding are smoking and forcing you to take in the polluted air, it harms you too. Thirdly, I suppose that restaurant is place where the beauty of wonderful food culture can be showed rather than the place to show the unhealthy habits of human beings, also, the smoke of cigarettes may lead to the decline of our appetite. At last, smoking may also cause accidents, for example, a small cigarette may lead to a fire accident if meet the sofa, carpet. On the other hand, I am opposed to ban the smoking at all restaurants. The most significant reason is that the smokers also have their own right to make a choice, it's not that considerable of us to take their right away from them. Then, it's known to us that smoking is a culture of human society, usually, good cigarette or cigar can show one's taste for life and make a businessman distinctive. Smoking at table can also be one of reasons linking to their success of enterprise, especially in China. In fact, we can take other measures to create good environment in the restaurants, for an instance, draw a line between no-smoking area and smoking area. To conclude, smoking has its bad effects, it disgusts others when damages smokers themselves' health, but we are supposed to take some more effective and humanity measures instead of ignoring the rights of smokers.
