For college students like us yes it is important to have a part time job. Not every college students can afford the tuition fees and others needed in their course. It is important because in the first place our goal is to finish our studies and find a job in the future. A part time job can help not only you but it is also for your parents, so you can help them even you're a college student. You can divide your salary to your school fees also to give some for your parents. Having a part time job can be a distraction to your studies because you don't have enough time to rest. You need to study and work for you and your family. But if you have a goal to finish it you can. It is not only for your present but also for your future. Working students should have perseverance so that they can finish their studies and also by helping their parents. It is important because you can buy anything you want but you should limit yourself. As we all know that it can be a distraction to the students because they will become exhausted of doing their job then studying in school. Others will say that having a part time job is not important because they don't have any problem in terms of money. Rich people have their permanent job or somewhat a company. We're not a human being that is not becoming tired but we are a normal person wants to enjoy life to the fullest. Part time jobs can help a better result for our future.
