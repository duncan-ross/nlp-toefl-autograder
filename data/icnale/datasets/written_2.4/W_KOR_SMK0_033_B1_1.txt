<Why we should ban the smoking?> what do you think about smoking bans? It is quite long time since Korea banned smoking in public. However, there is still some concerned about smoking bans, because some smokers insist that smoking bans are devise and a source of aggravation and friction. But, I strongly suggest that we should ban the smoking in restaurant completely, Smoking bans in restaurant is right of nonsmokers. By this time, unless nonsmokers clearly don't smoke cigarette, they suffered from blowing smoke from smoker's cigarette. There is no more need to speak of harms of passive smoking. It is obvious that until now smoker don't care about nonsmokers' health and feeling. However, it is time to be aware of nonsmokers' right. Moreover, it is insanitary that smoking is restaurant. Let's imagine that all smoker smoke cigarette in restaurant. The restaurant will be filled with thick cigarette smoke and the food reek dreadfully of tobacco instead of smelling nice. The worst thing is cigarette ash in your dishes! Smoking in restaurant is really insanitary, so we must ban the smoking. Smoking in restaurant should ban, because we guarantee nonsmokers' right and it is sanitary. For other person's right and sanitary condition, smokers should try to take care of smoking in public. So we should make both smoker and nonsmoker can satisfy with their living environment.
