Recently, number of university students are having part-time job during their study and their main reasons for having part-time job is to earn money and to obtain working experience. Therefore, someone claim that it is important for university students to have part-time job. I deeply disagree with this statement and detail two reasons to oppose this statement. First and foremost, university students need to attend so many courses every day. If they spent some time to do part-time job, how much time did they have to rest, revision or exercise? And do they still have health life style anymore? The answer is almost not. Some may argue that university students can obtain experience from doing part-time job but that is not so important for students' future because the owner will not consider part-time job working experience. Second, to earn money is not so important to students because government have well system to solve students' financial problem such as grant loan to provide money to pay for tuition fee and cost of living. There is unnecessary to doing part-time job to earn that so small amount of money. To conclude, having part-time job doesn't give too much thing to students and that will cause too much pressure to students. Therefore, l does oppose university students to have part-time job.
