I agree with banning people from smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Some businesses now say that no one can smoke cigarettes in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. And I think restaurants are the place where people have meals and relaxation, smoking will have terrible effect on them. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. In public places, the harm of a smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous vapor off into the air. Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. All in all, banning smoking at all the restaurants is very necessary. I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us.
