Have you ever worked as part-timer while you study your major in university? A lot of university students have worked at various area of place such as restaurant, theater, store and so on. ]The majority of students worked after class or when they have enough time. As working, students can make money and experience regarding major or style of living. I think that it is important for university students to have a part-time job in several reasons. First, university students can make extra money except for pocket money from parents. I had worked a lot of place such as Masaya, Baskinrobbins 31, Crispy Crème, Mr. Pizza, save zone and so on. As working, I could have had installment savings and paid a charge of cell phone myself. So, I lighten my parent's burden. Furthermore, students who earn an own tuition have been increasing. Second, we can learn about style of living at working place. When I was part-timer at work place, I have to greet politely, face kindly and smile always to customers. So, I was changed more kindly and calmingly than before. Also, I could have patience for people. If you waste your extra time, challenge part-time job. You can lighten your parent's burden and learn about upright personalities. Summer vacation is coming. What are you doing now? Just do it!
