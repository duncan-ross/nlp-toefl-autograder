I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because I believe that it is more efficient to concentrate on studies solely and upon completion of studies, get a proper and well-paying job than to study and work at the same time. Firstly, college students' main job is to learn. This refers to gaining knowledge and skills that we assume to be useful and relevant to their work in future. Optimal learning can occur only if students pay attention and participate actively in class. Often, students holding part-time jobs do not ample time for both work and study. As a result, they end up tired or lethargic in both. Since few can manage their time so well so as there is still ample time for study, it is more important for students to focus on studying, their main priority in college. If the reason for students working is to gain work experience so as to boost their resumes, I think it might be better if they join co-curricular activities that can develop their interests and skills, or go on overseas exchange trips to broaden their perspectives and become more independent and adaptive adults. After all, quality is more important than quantity when it comes to resumes. Lastly, most students work for practical financial reasons to support themselves or help decrease their parents' financial burden. Although it seems like the right thing to do, it is ultimately unnecessary, unless they are extremely financially-disadvantaged. The onus is thus upon the government to ensure that these students are entitled to studying without having to worry about money.
