 Supposing that you are at a family reunion party in an elegant restaurant. You are eating delicious food, tasting the wine and fully enjoying the merry atmosphere. Then all of a sudden, the smelly smoke of a cigarette comes into your nose, drawing away all your sense of satisfaction of the night. Of course, the smoker is exactly what you are going to complain of. If I were the one who encounter such an unpleasant situation, I would surely hope to sweep smoking out of my country completely. Since restaurants are public places where many people breathe the same air, people shouldn't pollute the fresh air out of their selfishness. Also, it is a widely acknowledged fact that smokers do greater harm to people around them than to themselves though these people just take in harmful air. More seriously, smoking in public places like restaurants is likely to cause fire, which may at the same time claim a lot of other innocent lives and totally destroy the restaurant building, thus resulting in a huge loss. We have to admit that it's a too big price to pay! Taking all safety and health factors into account, I strongly suggest smoking be banned at all the public places, not only in restaurants in the country. Everybody has a role to play while being a part of social life. Whether we are able to create a safe and harmonious social environment or not lies in exactly what we are doing.
