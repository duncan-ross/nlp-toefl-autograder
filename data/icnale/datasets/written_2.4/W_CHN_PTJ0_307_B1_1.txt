 Recently, the topic on part-time job has been brought into focus and the voices from different people vary from each other. Some reckon that part-time job is necessary for college students while other people consider not. To my mind, part-time job is of great necessity though it may bring some inconvenience and clashes. To begin with, I think, part-time job can enrich our daily life. Since we have courses in weekdays, spending the weekends in doing part-time job instead of wasting time should be appreciated. Moreover, as is known to us all, college students should maintain some work experience, to some degree, and doing part-time job is a pretty fancy way to enrich students' work experience. Thirdly, we can get some extra money just by doing part-time jobs, which gives us both the happiness of striving and the hardship of working. In other words, we can not only get money but also gain the mental fortune. On the other side, however, the part-time job may cost us some time but we should not throw away a superb rose just because of its prickles. So at last I emphasize that part-time job is very necessary for college students.
