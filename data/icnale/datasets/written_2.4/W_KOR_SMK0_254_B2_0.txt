I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When someone is allowed in a restaurant, other non smokers' rights are hurt. Someone might claim that smoker has the same right to smoke as the nonsmoker has the right to do not smoke, but someone's right can be justified when it doesn't hurt another's right. It means that someone's right is confined until it doesn't intrude another's right. In these days, the restaurants usually divide the sections, one section for smokers and the other for nonsmokers. However, although they divide the sections, the smokes are easily escaped from the smoking area to nonsmoking area. It really bothers to the nonsmokers who don't want any smokes while eating their foods. Yesterday I went to the Seoul National University subway station to eat dinner with my boyfriend and we decided to eat chicken. We got into the restaurant and started to eat dinner, and suddenly I smelled smokes. Looking around, I found the guys next our table smoked, and then I was really annoyed from that moment. The chickens suddenly seem not delicious, and I just felt I wanted to go out there. In my opinion, there might be lots of people who experienced unhappy mood during the eating because of the smokers in the same restaurant. Therefore I would be grateful if the all the restaurant in the country completely ban the smoking.
