I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Or if the kids can give the parents the money that is earned by them, their parents will be very happy.

" A first-generation college student, Natapong came from a hard-working family who had little money to spare. As a student at Nanangpattanasuksa School, I had hoped to study engineering after graduation. That didn't work out, but a Kasatsart University scholarship allowed him to start college right out of high school. "The scholarships were really what kept me in school when I had exhausted all my own funds, " he says. "Thankfully they always came at the right moment. "
