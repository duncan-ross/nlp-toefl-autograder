In my opinion, it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job. Firstly, university students should focus on their studies because they are going to learn professional knowledge and the pace of university education is usually fast-paced. Handling school works is not an easy task already. If students has a part-time job while they are studying, they may not be able to handle both sides unless they make more effort and manage their time well. In the worst case, a student may have a bad academic result and even become unemployed from the part-time job due to poor performance, making him/her difficult in finding jobs after graduation since he/she has a lower competitiveness compared with those who concentrate on their studies and get a good result. It could be argued that having a part-time job can gain working experience which may increase the quality of a student. However, I believe that having an internship would be a better choice. The reason is that a part-time job such as being a private tutor may not provide any certification. However, internships provided by companies can give students official certification and also evaluation from the employer. These definitely increase the quality of a resume. In addition, students usually take part in internships in summer holidays, so it is easier for them to manage their time and their academic performance would not be greatly affected. Since a part-time job may affect the academic performance of a student seriously and there is a better alternative to gain working experience, I think that it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job.
