Smoking is not good. Cigarettes are a drug. Cigarettes are bad for our body. But we still smoke cigarettes because Cigarettes are addictive. My father smoke. Heavily and I hate my father smoke heavily. My friends smoke, too. I wish they don't take a cigarette. Cigarette is known is not good in the world. People know Cigarettes is not good. But people cannot seem to quit. The Smoker is addictive. Lots of people are getting cancer cause of it. We must warn everyone how serious smoking is and we must help them stop. It's been years since I heard that the government has raised the price of cigarettes. But they didn't raise it to make people stop. They did it to earn more profits. I mean why did they only raise 500won if they intended to make people stop smoking? They should have risen more and more. But there's one problem. If this policy really works, and no one buys a cigarette, Korea will get a big damage. Almost more than 5 percent of budget is earned by cigarettes. But if this stops, all of us could get in trouble. So it will be impossible to make them stop selling cigarettes.
