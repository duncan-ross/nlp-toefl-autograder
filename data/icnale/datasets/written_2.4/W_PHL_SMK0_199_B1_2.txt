Smoking, one of the vices Filipinos are largely engaged in, is one of the main factors which cause death in the Philippines. In order for the people living in the Philippines to have a healthier lifestyle, laws on smoking bans have already been enacted but not yet strictly implemented in all the parts of the country. It may also cause addiction which is an effect of smoking that is hard to avoid. What does smoking do to the lives of the people who are addicted to it? Banning of smoking must be implemented at all the restaurants here in the Philippines because not all Filipinos like the smell of the nicotine that is being emitted through smoking. It must not only be banned at the restaurants, but also in all parts of the country. Smoking is bad for the health, and is as bad for those people who are the receivers of the smoke being emitted by the main smoker. Smoking causes lung cancer, bad breath and other side effects that are bad for the health. If a person smokes at the restaurant, the smoke being emitted will be transferred to the food being cooked in the restaurant. This will then be eaten by the people at the restaurant which in turn will make them sick. Inhaling the smoke from a cigarette is bad for the health, and is as bad as drinking of alcoholic beverages.
