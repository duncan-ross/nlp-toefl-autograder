These days, many college students have a part-time job because of their school fee, allowance, or experience. I think it is important that college students have a part-time job for any reason. The most important reason is if they get a job after graduate school, students who had a part-time job are better at social life than students who didn't have a part-time job. I had a part-time job when I was a sophomore during summer vacation. My job was ticketing so I deal with lots of people every day. It was so exhausted and too hard. I wanted quit the job at that time but I endure at the end. I think it's very good experience for me. If I don't have any job experience, and get a job after graduate, I just quit work even I have a little difficult. Therefore it's good experience to have a part-time job for their social life. Another reason is for self-reliance. High school students are just teenager but college students are adult. Adult is old enough to be on their own. They feel more good themselves if they earn their allowance than they depend on their parents. Therefore I absolutely agree that college students have a part-time job if it doesn't affect their study.
