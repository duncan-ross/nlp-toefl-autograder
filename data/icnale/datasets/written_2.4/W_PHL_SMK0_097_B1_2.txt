Smoking is an act wherein the person smoking is actually slowly killing himself by inhaling those harmful substances that are in the cigarette. Its main target is the lungs where the substances in the cigarette will burn it and make it very weak. A place where smoking should be banned is in restaurants because it is where all types of people go to eat and it will not be a good sight for children to see adults smoking their life away where the children might think that it is alright for them to smoke because it is allowed in places like this. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because not only will it lessen the pollution in our environment but also improve the quality of life by reducing the places where people can smoke. I personally think that smoking should be completely banned everywhere since it does will only provide them with negative effects on the people doing it and the people affected by it. By banning smoking at the restaurants, less number of people will suffer the consequences of second hand smoking and children will not be exposed to it as much.
