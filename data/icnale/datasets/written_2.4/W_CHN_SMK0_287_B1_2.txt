 Smoking addiction among people has been a big concern, considering it causes great harm to people's health little by little. So, I must argue that smoking should be banned in public places, especially restaurants. There are several reasons to support my opinion. Primarily, smoking poses series health problems to the smokers themselves. Most smokers get lung diseases because of smoking. What's worse, smoking will decrease people's immune system, causing people get ill more easily. Although the cigarette boxes are printed smoking is bad for health, smokers continue to smoke. Since the number of people addicted to smoking is so huge and the number is still climbing, we can sense it is high time for us to stop people smoking. One of the efficient ways to solve this problem is banning smoking in restaurants. And the harmful air that smokers breath leads to immense harm to the nonsmokers' health. In restaurants', there are many nonsmokers eating, adding the fact that the air in restaurants does not flow quickly, the smoke makes nonsmokers suffer even greater. In conclude, smoking is bad for both smokers and nonsmokers health, we must ban smoking in restaurants.
