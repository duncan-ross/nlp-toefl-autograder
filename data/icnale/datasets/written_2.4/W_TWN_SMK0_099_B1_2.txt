I don't completely agree with this idea, though I hate second-hand smoking. In my opinion, Smoking should be banned at "most" restaurants, but a few restaurants should be allowed smoking. It is hard for those smokers quit smoking in such a short time; especially they have smoked for years or decades. So I think there should be room for smokers to smoke at meals. If there are restaurants providing two areas of smoking and non-smoking, and having totally apart air-circulating system, these should not be illegal. These restaurants would be a good choice for those smokers. On the other hand, how to define a restaurant? Like some restaurants in the night market, they would not be totally "indoor", maybe half-opened. And this would be a dilemma to define whether they are restaurants or not. If they are, why the customers can't smoke in an open area? Therefore it is hard to stick to the rule of no-smoking at "all" the restaurants. However, to forbid smoking at "most" restaurants could be difficult, since the smoking customers would not go to the no-smoking restaurants, and then those restaurants would lose income from these ones. So after all, all of the restaurants are completely banned smoking legally.
