 Nowadays more and more college students take up part time jobs in their spare time, as far as I am concerned, it does much good to the students and they should be encouraged to do so. The reasons are as follows. First of all, we students may get some amount of money by doing part time jobs. The money is important not only because we can purchase something, but also the fact that we learn how hard it is to earn money. Then we will understand our parents and make full use of our pocket money. Secondly, by doing part time jobs, we get a lot of experience that we will never learn about in our classes. As for our students, there is little time for us to know about the society. However, part time job provides us with the chance and we get the experience in time. Then we have the advantage over others who have no access to part time jobs. Last but not least, doing part time job is meaningful because we are able to put theories into practice. For example, for a student who is major in mechanic engineering. If he only learns theories, he will not have a good command of it. Only by doing part time job and explore the work on his own can he really understand his major. So in a word, doing part time job is pretty good and we college students should be encouraged to do so.
