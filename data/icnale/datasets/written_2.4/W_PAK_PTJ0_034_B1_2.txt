The student of new generation are unaware of the demand of modern age. They are involved in petty persuits and are living all lives. They hardly pay attention to their studies. And the education is the important factor leading to the success of the nation. I am really against the issue that part time job is essential for college students. The foremost responsibility of a student is to be well educated and acquire higher grade which is only achieved by hard work because hard work is the key to success. If the students start doing jobs. They will waste their time and would face great hardships. They would not be able to cope with their tough life and at last, will unable to attain their goals due to their stiff and tiring life. The students should pay their full attention towards their studies. Anyhow, if the students are deficit of their basic requirements and have a tough job to get hold of their family by their income, they should do part time jobs but only in that aspect that a light job which do not effect their health. And through it the students sufficiently fulfill his and his family expenses. But if a student does not falls short of any of his needs, he should avoid doing part time jobs and be confident that after being professional, he will earn his own income and would live independently.
