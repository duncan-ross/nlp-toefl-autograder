Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I can't agree with this statement. I intend to explain why I think so. First, I don't like cigarettes but I think that smokers have a right to smoke because smoking is permitted legally. If many smokers want to smoke while eating or after the meal, I think we don't have a right to ban it. Second, I think restaurants should promote to separate smoking and no smoking. There are many people who feel unpleasant to cigarettes, including me. Some of them don't eat at restaurants which don't provide not smoking seats. But if restaurants provide smoking seats and not smoking seats, they will eat there. If restaurants do it, they may make more benefit. And they cost little expense to provide their seats. Finally, if you think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I think smoking should be banned every places except smoking areas. Otherwise we can't explain to smokers why they must not smoke at only restaurants. Smoking is difficult problems for us. I think we shouldn't consider these problems with biased views. We must solve them for both smokers and not smokers.
