 Everybody needs a job, and someone need job. But what about having a part job? When we in university, did we need to and should have a part job My idea about this question is that it has to be decided after clearly know oneself. As we all know each people is different from others. Firstly, our dreams are different. Some examples, some want to be a normal worker, and some want to be a scientist. Secondly our experience is also different, some have known our society a lot, but some have not known our world will; some can communicate with others easily, but some can not. So we have to make our own decisions. Maybe someone around you has a good reason to get or not to do a part job, but you had better to think about yourself after know yourself really. On the other hand, we must know what a part job can bring to us. A part job can give you a place to work, can bring you some money. It also can let you have a good chance to improve your skill. And we also have to get an opinion that a part job would do harm to you at the same time. Having a part job, you would have less time to study, to play basketball, to read the books you like and you want to read and so on. To have a good knowledge of yourself and what you meet with is very important. A part job is a just a part job, do not let it bore you. And you only make your own decision. you should and have to do what you like.
