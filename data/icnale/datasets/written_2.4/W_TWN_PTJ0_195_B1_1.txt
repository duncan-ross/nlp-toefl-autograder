Nowadays, there are many college students in Taiwan have part time jobs. Why do so many students want to have a job and what kind of jobs do they work? Do they want to earn money or to have some special experience? I don't have any part time jobs, but I want to find one. In my opinion I think if I have a part time job, there is something I would get. First, I can earn money to afford my schooling and my daily expense. Second, through working, I can learn something that would not learn in school such as facing the customers and your boss. At last, I think part time job just like a small society, everything would happen. In my daily life, some classmates of mine also have part tome jobs. Some of them work in cram schools and the others work in restaurants. These jobs are most working students have. Some students also go to abroad such as New Zealand, USA, and England. They work in hotels or farms. I think that also special part time jobs. Not only earn money but also improve language speaking. There are so many jobs can students have, just find one in your learning age. But everything has to be careful.
