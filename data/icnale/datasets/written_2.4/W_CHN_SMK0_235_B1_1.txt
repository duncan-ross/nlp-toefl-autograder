Nowadays in some countries smoking is completely forbidden, and the smoking rooms are also closed. It makes some people who are opposite smoking very delight. They think it is so good a rule that must do great good to human health. But the people who smokes feels unpleasant very much. It is so inconvenient for me, when I arrived station I used to have a cigarette to keep myself awake, but now I am forbidden to do It. a smoker said. As far as I am concerned, I don't think it is right to completely forbidden smoking in public places. Though smoking will do damage to our health, we should deal with it properly. Knowing the disadvantage, there are still many people smoking. They do it with all kinds of purposes such as to keep awake, to remit pressure. We all know that caffeine contained in tea and coffee also have bad influence on health. We can accept that people drink tea and coffee, why can't we accept people smoking. What I said may be farfetched, but we should respect others' hobby. Many people may say we do it just because we want to protect others from bad influence. I think it is their excuse. Just what we did, we can make smoking room in the public places. We should respect others' hobby, even it is not healthy. We can persuade them to get out of the hobby, but we have no right to prevent them from it as long as it is legal.
