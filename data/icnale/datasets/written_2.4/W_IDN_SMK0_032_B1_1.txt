And cigarette has a lot of effects. Cigarette contains a lot of danger substances, such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxside, etc. For the active smokers, it can cause mouth cancer, impotency, liver cancer, pregnant and foetus risk, heart attack, etc. And for the passive smokers, it can cause asthma, cough, even death when they inhale the smoke. In this era, it will be very difficult to ban smoking, although the government and other organizations have published that smoking is banned or haram in Indonesia. So, the government should ban smoking in the public area, especially in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place that people have their breakfast or lunch or dinner or supper. Of course, while they are enjoying their food, they must not be disturbed with the smoke. To avoid the effects, restaurant's manager must supply a separate smoking area. So, the restaurant visitors will not be disturbed and the smokers can smoke everytime they want without harming the others.
