Smoking is harmful, whatever the perspective you choose to stand. So I think it should be banned totally in public places. To begin with, long-term smoking is extremely dangerous to one's human body. Research has indicated that a great percentage of cancers are aroused by the toxic substances in cigarettes. Things people inhale while smoking will go through the whole body by our circulation system, and then damage our cells. It is government's duty to help preventing such things from happening. In the second place, it is well known that people are actually being compelled to smoke for a bit when they are in a smoking environment. To be frank, this is not the responsibility they have to take. They are victims. However, if smoking is not officially banned in public places, things will only get worse and those people who do not smoke simply can do nothing to help. Last but not least, people will get addicted to cigarettes; no matter they are active or passive smokers. In addition to that, public smoking indeed poses a great threat to basic civil rights and that is awful. All in all, I think smoking should totally be banned in public places.
