Restaurant is a place you can relax yourselves, where i think should be clean and quiet. While if someone smokes there, he will definitely break this and deeply affect the customers around. As we all know, smoking is bad for our health. Nowadays, more and more people who never smokers are troubled by the problems caused by their lung. How could they do that? Once you breathe the smoke in the air from the smokers, you are equally having smoked. So, banning smoking in restaurants is both good for the environment of the restaurant and the health of the customers. Besides the reason above, smoking is also bad for the smokers, not just his health. If you smoke in a public place, the smoke you make may pollute the air around you, which make others easily notice that you are smoking. If I were one of them, I would immediately keep myself away from you, for the first feeling tells me that you are not a good person and you can but hurt me, because smoking is a bad behavior in most people's opinions. So you'd better not smoke especially in the restaurant, in such a clean and quiet place. In a word, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
