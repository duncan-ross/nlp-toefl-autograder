In my opinion, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students nowadays can easily study in college, even they don't study hard, and in other words, they don't need to spend much time in study. If they have a lot of time to choose what they should do, one of their choice should be do a part-time job, if they don't have this choice, I think they have ignored their responsity to be a son or daughter, a student and a person in this society, in my opinion (I have accepted a thought that a college is just like a small society), what college students has to do is to learn how to live in a college. College students can learn how to talk to different ages people, and they can learn many experience if they work at a place that many people stay. A part-time job can also help college students know different people work with them. Those people who have more or less life experience will let college students realize what a good world they live in. I consider that do a part-time job is a way to accept what this world realize look like, it's just a way, but use this way college students can learn how to live by their only ability, and know what they can do.
