To a large extent, I am supportive of a complete smoking-ban at all restaurants in the country. In the first place, efforts have been made to discourage the public from smoking. Banning smoking in a common social area may help in that goal. As a non-smoker, there is a strong discomfort to be near a smoker due to the secondhand smoke emitted. This smoke is also one of the reasons why non-smokers with a healthy lifestyle could be diagnosed with lung cancer. When people patronize a restaurant, what they look for is a pleasant time with their friends and family while having an enjoyable meal with a suitable ambience. Having smokers nearby would possibly disrupt this social time. Indeed, some restaurants do have specific spaces where they allow for smoking. These spaces are most probably situated outside the restaurant instead of within the restaurant. It is plausible that there are customers who are smokers that wish to smoke during a meal and some restaurants would like to accommodate to that. However, if they wish to portray a family-friendly image or even a classy one, allowing smoking will not be suitable despite the location. When patrons view the restaurant as a whole, the fact that smoking is allowed will come into the picture which may dull the restaurant's image.
