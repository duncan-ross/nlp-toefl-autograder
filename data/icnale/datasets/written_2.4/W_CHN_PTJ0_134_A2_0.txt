It is important for college students to have a part-time job. For modern college students, it is useful to have a part-time job. There are many benefits of having a part-time job. Students who have a part-time job are easier to be accepted by enterprises. To modern enterprises, diploma is not the only way to text the employee, working experience is become more and more important when a leader decides whether the employee to get the job or not. For example, a graduate with high diploma but no working experience and another with a common diploma but have rich experience, which one would you like? If I'm the leader, I'll choose the second without hesitation. Maybe someone will oppose me, students' duty is study, isn't it? I think that's middle school's students' duty, and college students' duty is not only study but learn more principles when you live. Have a part-time job is a good chance to learn!To me, I really want to have a part-time job, but I never find it because I'm too lazy. I think many students just like me, they are to lazy to have a part-time job. In a word, I'll try, if I find a job fit me, I'll do that!
