Students with Part Time Jobs: A Role Model for Today's Youth A person must have their rest for atleast 7 to 8 hours in a day. A factual statement based from scientific researches, which is refused to comply by students with part time jobs. A zombie student, that's what some people call the students with part time jobs. It's because they sometimes look so tired when they attend their classes. I strongly disagree with those who discriminate them. In fact, I looked at them as a role model for us students because they strive really hard for them to be able to get the education they need. I had talked earlier to someone who is a part time student and he explained to me why sometimes he looks not very well when he attends his classes. Even though sometimes they fell asleep in class discussions, I understand them because it is really hard to deal with their schedule. They attend to school in the morning till dusk and work in the night till dawn. It is like living 24 hours in a day. They are not doing that for a little purpose but they do their utmost ability for them to be able to afford studying in universities or colleges. They always put in their minds that the effort that they insert in their works will lead them into success. I feel lucky because I don't have to work for my education. On the other hand, I feel sorry for those students who waste their money spending in school even though the only thing they want is to have some good time with their peers. Sometimes, I wish that those students, who always have good time, switch lives with those students who work hard for their education. With that I think they will soon know what real life means.
