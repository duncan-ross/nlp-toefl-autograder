I am a smoker. When I was nine teen years old, I took tobacco from my father's pants. That time, I just felt curiosity about tobacco. So I smoke heavily from then on. I got caught smoking in the restroom by my mother. My mother was very surprised. She told me "quit smoking" but I couldn't control my patience. So I became a smoker. I tried to smoke myself into composure. Smoking is very bad for body and nonsmoker. Although I know this fact, I smoke without a break. When I was 21years old, I could stop smoking because I entered the army. Just 30 days, I couldn't buy tobacco, so I could cut smoking forcibly. That time, a few days after giving up smoking, I started to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. But 30 days after, I went to furlough, I started smoking again. For this reason, I couldn't control myself. I think my patience is very poor. Above all things, if you cut the smoking, you need to learn to be more patient. Lacking in patience people never succeed in quit smoking. Here are some method raise your patients. First, eat candy instead of smoking time. Second, when do you feel withdrawal symptoms, let's do exercise!! These are so subjective. But many of people that use this method when they feel withdrawal symptoms. Do your best for stopping smoke. I hope that you feel better soon.
