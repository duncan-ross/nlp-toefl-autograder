A part time job is an occupation which one enjoys and takes part in during Ones spare times. It isn't a regular job because we can do a part time job whenever we want to do and many hours that you need to work. Wages of a part time job is about thirty-five bath per hour, but if the day you work is a holiday you will get money more than usual double. You get double wage, because you must sacrifice your personal time to live with your family for go to work. Because of educations are important things for collect students, so if collect students don't have a good knowledge. In the future they may not have a good job and have a less opportunity than collect student who have a good knowledge. I think if some collect students who can't support their tuition fee, they should have a part time job, because it can help to lighten their parents about tuition. I think it not only collect student who have not a good status can work a part time job, but collect student who want to have special auxiliary allowance can work it, too. It make you feel impress when you save up the money that you earn with your effort, and you sometimes deplore to use this money to buy something that you need by this money. I think it is a good way to save your money. When we work a part time job it give we more utility such as it give we more experience how to train to work with other people in the future, have a good relationship with colleagues, we will get more responsibility for work and we will know how to allocate times for your work.
