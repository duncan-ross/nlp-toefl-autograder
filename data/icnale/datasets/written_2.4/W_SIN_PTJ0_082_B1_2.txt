It is not important for college students to have part time jobs. (Is "it is important for college students to have a part-time job" grammatically suspect?) Many tout the advantages, or neccessity, of getting part time jobs while in college, for students need to learn the difficulty of earning their keep, or how to deal with workplace stresses and relationships, or how to become functional at a job in future. Students should get off their lazy arses and learn about the "Real world", one may say. Yet, by simply imploring students to take a part time job, more often than not, these students do not need them. Kids who need part time jobs just to pay their tuition or other life's neccessities will take part time work; kids who need to be told to get them, and how important they are to their personal development, really do not need to take these jobs. After all, the part time work offered to college students are often mind-numbing, soul-crushing work that adds very little except perhaps financially. Bussing, or waiting, or washing up and all these other menial work are simply jobs that are given to people who are unable to take up jobs elsewhere and need to pay the bills nonetheless. You learn very little except to feel bitter and tired. Kids who have the privilege to do without them should do without them. Instead, volunteer somewhere, or work at a craft, and really learn something. No one should feel it is important to take up part time work just to feel the burn. Feel the burn in your stomach to build yourself up to do something cool and life-changing out of college instead.
