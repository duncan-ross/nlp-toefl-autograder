I think smoking shoud be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because I often enjoy smell and taste of dinner at restaurants, but smoke destroys ohteres happy dinner time. Many people who do not smoke don't like the tabacco's smell. The smell erase good smell of food. Many restaurants depart the seats for smoker and for not smoker, however, smoke cover large space and make many people, not smoker, feel worse and not appitite. So. searts deparetion have no sense. And when we sit a seat after smokers, we suffer from the bad smell which remind in the seat. Smoking is bad thing especially bad thing at places to eat food and used by many people. Many people have knew the fact the smoke include bad material which cause a lot of illness. We go to restaurants to eat delisious food, not to get illness. I think there are many people who like to smoke, but they can do out of restaurants too. Recentry, at many insturuments used by many people in Japan, smoking is banned. At a official place, they think other people. So, to enjoy lunch, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants.
