Some people hold the view that smoking should be forbidden in public places. However others stand on the opposite side, thinking it's much to strict. As far as I am concerned, I support the former. The reasons are as follows. First and foremost, it is commonly acknowledged that smoking do great damage to smokers' health and even make smokers have lung cancers. Since there is no good to smoke, why do people smoke and even can be allowed to smoke in public places? Besides, when a person smoke in public places, people around him, including infants and the old, have to breathe the smoke air given off by the cigarette. In some public places which are indoor and only have limited space, such as libraries and restaurants, the damage smoking do must be greater because the polluted air stay inside instead of going out. Last but not least, cigarette butts and thick smoke may probably lead to a big fire, destroying public facilities, such as buildings, parks, libraries, theatres and so on. From all these reasons raised, we can come to the conclusion that smoking should be banned in public places, not only for ourselves and people around us but also for public safety.
