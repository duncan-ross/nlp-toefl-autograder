I think part time job is important for those students who lack of budget for their studying. This can be a way for them to earn money and use this money in financing their own tuition fees. It will be difficult but if they really want to finish studying they will have perseverance and the will in everything that they do. Part time job is also a need for those students who don't have anything to do when they have vacation. Instead of doing non-sense thing or wasting their time playing computer games and any other thing they can have a part tie job. By this they can earn money and be producible. It is indeed a good thing because students will learn how to value money because they might it difficult in earning it and try to think whether they are spending it well. Many students nowadays will just get money from their parents and spending not wisely in mall or for guys spending it in computer shops. It also teaches students how handle money responsibly. Part time job can be help in preparing or training students in a real word basis. It can be a plus points in applying for a job because they already know that a student have a past background in working. There will always be a catch because while working a student must balance his or her time in working and studying. In another point of view this can be good because it can teach students how to be responsible in managing their time.
