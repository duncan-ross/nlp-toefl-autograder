Nowadays many college students in Indonesia have a part-time job with different purpose. College student is brave to take a part-time job, because they have free time at every day. We know if college student enter to campus only 2-4 hour in one day. And they think if have a part-time, so he can help her parents in administration, have add pocket money in one month, etc I disagree with the statement, if college student to have a part-time job is important, because that activity have bad effect for college student. College student is must always healthy and concentration, so can get all knowledge from lecture easily. But if have a part-time job we hardly to manage our body, because we more focus with the job and we forget to eat and drink, so make we sick and no present in the campus. No present in the campus make we have bad score and no understand in every lesson. Not only that, if have a part time job, we will more long time to graduate and we must pay more. So we useless have a part-time job because have many negative effects more than positive effects. I will give suggestion for reader, if you do something you must ready with consequences. So you must prepare at now and you must look in all side. And you must always have positive thinking about all that you do if you want positive value.
