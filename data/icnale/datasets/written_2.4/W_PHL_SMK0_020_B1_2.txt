Whenever I see someone smoking in public random thoughts come into my head. I wonder if they know the consequences of smoking? It's not only dangerous for their selves but also to the people surrounding them because second hand smoke is much more hazardous. When I was young I decided to write a law against smoking in the Philippines not only in the public places but in the whole country. I thought that if smoking was banned in our state the number of people suffering from lung related deceases would decrease and our citizens who were previous smokers would also save more because they won't have to save money just to buy cigarettes. Recently a law against smoking in public areas was approved here in the Philippines. It's not exactly what I opted for but it was a good start for our country but now I have realized that people usually chose not to obey the law. I had those realization days ago after our classes started. There was this place near our school where most of the students eat because food there is cheap and the only bad thing about that place is that most students stay there to smoke polluting not only the air but also the lungs of those who pass in front of them. There never was a time when I have not seen anyone smoking in that place and they are not only breaking the law passed by the government but they are also violating the rules of the school. I think that banning smoking not only from restaurants but also from all public places should be strictly implemented not only for the health of those who suffer from taking in second hand smoke but also for the betterment of our country and the good of our environment.
