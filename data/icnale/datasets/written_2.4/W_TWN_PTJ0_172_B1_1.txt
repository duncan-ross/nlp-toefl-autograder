When I see this topic, first idea show up in my mind is that I disagree this statement. Nowadays, more and more college students get part-time job when they in school. Although college students have a part-time job is not bad. However, they need ability to get balance in the job and learning. They can get more experience and money from job, they can buy something they want, they also can build a good relationship in the work places, but having a part-time job is so time-costing, seldom of them can get a high grade in the final test. For example, my classmate in senior high school has a part-time job, since he spending more time in the job, he didn't study hard as before, his grade was getting bad. He asked me how to do and I just suggest him to give up the job. If he could not do it, he has no choice. To get balance in the job and learning, he did his best to get balance in the job and learning, but as time as he did, he started feeling so tired then he given up the job end up. After this event, his experience tells me that college students take care of their study in this time period is more important than get a part-time job.
