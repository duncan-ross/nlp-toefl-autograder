I think a part-time job can be needed but is not important for college students. Of course, it is a way to earn their own pocket money for college students. Also students can experience a lot of social activities previously and know many people through a part-time job. However, the most important thing to college students is study. Unlike high school, college students have to study their major further and spend more time for studying. According to college life, their job and future life is determined. But a part-time job takes much time and stamina. So a part-time job is bad thing for hard study. For example, my high school friend who did a part-time job had little time to do homework. Sometimes she slept in class because she waked up all night for doing homework. Her grade was not good in the middle term examination. Also students can earn their registration fee by scholarship. Recently, most universities have many good scholarship systems in school or out of school. So they can get lots of chances to make money by scholarship in many ways. Although a part-time job give some money, studying hard has much more advantages. Therefore I disagree that a part-time job is important for college students.
