When I go to a restaurant, I always see someone smoking. It is a very boring thing on account of I hate the smoke and the smell. Although almost people don't like smoking, but a part of people think smoking is their habit and we can't stop it. So there is a huge contradiction between these two types of people. On the one hand, almost people don't like smoking and they always think the smoking is bad for our health. When this type of people goes to the restaurant, they always get the second-hand smoking. it can affect the breath health with themselves. So this type of people supports to ban smoking at all the restaurants. On the other hand, smoker always think that smoking is their habit and it can't stop it very easily. Furthermore, the government supports the smoking because it is a big source of tax in finance. If we banned smoking at all the restaurants, it can decrease the selling of the cigarette. Generally speaking, to ban the smoking at all the restaurants is a difficult decision with the government. As the matter of fact, we should find a reasonable way to solve this problem. So now we cannot completely ban smoking in all the restaurants.
