Recently, government have punished smoker, and have expanded prohibition area of smoking. It is the result of changing awareness that government should protect the right of smoker because the government sells the cigarette to them. However, this concept has changed by expanding awareness that indirect smoking is very dangerous both smoker and non-smoker because the smoking threaten the health of people by causing cancer or bad disease in direct or indirect way. In this situation, some smokers complain about the area of forbidding smoking because there is no area to allow smoking, so they insist that smoking is allowed at least in restaurants. However, I strongly oppose their opinion. The restaurant is public space, not smoker's space. If the government allows to smoker in restaurant, many heavy smokers will be smoking at there, so non smoker will pervade their right of health because indirect smoke is also dangerous. Like the smoker want to smoke in restaurant, non smoker want to not smell smoke of cigarette. Therefore, I agree on the prohibition area of smoking in order to protect non smoker right.
