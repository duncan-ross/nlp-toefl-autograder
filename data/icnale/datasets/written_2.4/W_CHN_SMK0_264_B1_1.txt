As we all know, smoking does harm to our health. It's harmful not only to smokers. The cigarette smoke is also bad for non-smokers. So in many cities, smoking is forbidden in public places. As for restaurants, I think it's better to set up non-smoking and smoking zones than forbidden it strictly. Smoking has proved to be closely linked to many diseases such as cancer, heart problems. It's really unfair for non-smokers to be harmed by cigarette smoke. Since smoking is addictive, most smokers find it difficult to give up smoking although they know its harm. They may feel uncomfortable if not allowed to smoke. However, we must ensure that the health of non-smokers is not damaged. In my view, setting up smoking and non-smoking zones is a good way to solve the problem when taking the interests of both sides into account. Nowadays more and more people recognize the dangers of smoking. There are many kinds of publicities against smoking such as World No-Tobacco Day. There are also agencies to help people quit smoking. We will learn more about the dangers of smoking by those publicities and assistance. I hope there will be fewer and fewer smokers and whether to forbidden smoking in restaurants will not be a problem anymore one day because there are no cigarettes in the world.
