I agree with part time job important to college student. Part time job means you just work a half day. So we can do anything else when we are not work. That was make students have a chance to make extra money. We can take a part time job anywhere, like restaurant or somewhere else. There are some reason why part time job was important for college students. Reason one not all student college still with their parent and their parent still paying for their school. So many student must get a part time job to pay their tuition fees. Reason two college student need to not 'put their life in parents hands'. Student must became more responsibility to their life and part time job make their more responsibility. Reason three, makes students can earn extra money. Students can use their money to pay their school, or something else. Reason four gain experience. We all know, every days we are getting older and older that means students cannot keep with their parents forever. One day, all students must work. With part time job they can gain experience that is needed when they are work. Then they became more ready to work. And last reason why part time jobs needed because part time job makes they 'sharpened' their life skills and mental. They can became skillful, confidence, and can became more sociality.
