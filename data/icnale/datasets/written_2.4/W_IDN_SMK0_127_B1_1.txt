Smoking can give bad effects for us not only to the smoker but also to the others (non smoker). Here is the reason. One day when we have time for walking in some places like parks, malls, restaurants, etc. We can also meet smokers in there. Directly, this condition make us uncomfortable. Although, there is a sign 'no smoking' in that place but smoker still free for smoking. Unfortunately, as non smoker (passive smoker), we will get the bad effect from their action, too. The smoke is dangerous because it contain some chemicals materials such as nicotine. It can disturb our lungs's health after long time as the bad effect. I think, it is important for making some regulations about smoking in general places like in the restaurant. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. That is one of the way to minimize bad effect due to smoking. No Smoking ! board should be placed at right side, so the people can easy to read. A free smoking room is need for smoker in the restaurant. So they do not disturb other guest. The men usually like to take a cigarette in restaurant before or until their food is served. They also smoking after having their dinner. A heavy smoker can buy one pack of cigarette everyday.
