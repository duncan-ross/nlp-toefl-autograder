Part time job is a hot topic that often discussed by college students and their parents. During the college, whether to have a part time job is a problem worth thinking. Many people hold the idea that college students should find a part time job. For one thing, having a job and making money can make a children more independent. They will learn more from the society rather than the books only. For another thing, students will make a time plan if they have a part time job which can make for their job later. What's more, using the money made by themselves is very proud and happy. So, why not have a part time job? But someone have the opponent opinion. They think part time job has more disadvantages than advantages. On the one hand, it will take them so much time to do the jobs that they cannot devote themselves in the studying which is likely more meaningful. On the other, stepping into the society may be bad for them. If they cannot control themselves well, they will be trapped into the lair full of frightfulness. As far as I am concerned, if we can control ourselves well and having a part time job have no bad effect on studying, just do it.
