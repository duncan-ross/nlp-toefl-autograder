Nowadays smoking at the restaurant is big problem for people in somewhere such as CKB, Oishi, MK, and KFC. Many people support idea 'No smoking I think' same them because people who Smoking at all the restaurants are look like bad boy. and Smoking at all the restaurants is big problem for children because they dislike smoke and ash that it can move in the body. And Smoke is smelly. Every time I sit near people are smoking the restaurants I will go out at the restaurants but I think he should go out more than me. Smoking at all the restaurants is not true for Thai social so we can band him. Smoking should be completely band at all the restaurants in the country. Many countries such as Thailand, U. S. A Japan that banded people are smoking in the shop market or public place. Some time the manager of restaurant can tell people Who Smoking at the restaurant 'No smoking' in the restaurant but we have a zone for smoking for people who Smoking at all the restaurants beside the restaurant or he should have sicker 'no smoking' on the wall in front of restaurant. When who like Smoking at the restaurant can see the sticker. I sum up I am one of supporter idea 'no smoking' at the restaurant because it is problem for many people in the restaurant.
