I am a student completing a full-time degree and working a part-time job out of necessity because my parents do not have enough money to pay for all of my tuition and I wasn't fortunate enough to receive a scholarship although, I applied for several. Since starting work, I can honestly say that I am more confident, I manage my time a lot better than any of my classmates and I seem to have gained a certain level of respect from people that I wasn't aware of before. It is difficult at times, especially during exams, but I have been pretty lucky because I have a very understanding boss who goes out of his way to help me in any way that he can. I know my money situation has improved, no surprises there but I also don't stress out as much as some of my mates do when the pressure is on. I think that the way I think about and approach tasks has improved a lot and I make use of a few mini systems that my boss helped me create which allow me to break my tasks down into smaller chunks. I can only say that it has helped me and I feel a lot better within myself. So, I really do think that all students should get a part-time job if not for the money, then just for the extra skills that they can get while being paid to do so.
