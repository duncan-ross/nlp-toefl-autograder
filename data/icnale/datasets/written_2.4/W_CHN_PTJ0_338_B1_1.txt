 It is known to all that, in China, the man who can get a career must be 18 years old already. The age we get to university. So, can a college student do a part-time job while studying? I believe that it is necessary. On the one hand, Chinese students are poor in social experience. When compared with other students, like American students, we always get higher grades in test, but do really bad when we both work in the same job. That's to say, Chinese students cannot make learning into using. The solution I think might be getting a part-time job. In this way, not only do we get social experience, but also making some profits, and experiencing the life we outer to live in when we graduated. On the other hand, getting a part-time job is not getting a real job. As part-time jobs are costing our rest time, not the studying time, we could do a good part-time job together with learning well. Of course, part-time job must affect our daily study. But the affection can be positive. It makes us to use time more carefully that the job sometimes will replace doing homework on weekend. There are many famous people who live in poor family studied in college with one or more part-time jobs. And they were success, like LincoIn. As a conclusion, I agree on having a part-time job when we study in college. But everyone must put it in mind that we are students not workers, so studying is always the most significant thing in our life!
