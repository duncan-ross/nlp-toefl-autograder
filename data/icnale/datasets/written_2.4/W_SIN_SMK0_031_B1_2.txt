According to the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I fully agree. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for health and the problem that why youths pick up smoking is because of peer influence and they think that it is "cool". Banning smoking in more areas will tend to make smokers think twice before lighting up their cigarettes and makes youth to think twice if they want such a miserable life to always be finding for a place to smoke while their peers are hanging and chilling out at the restaurant whereby they are in a small corner smoking alone and missing out the fun. Ban smoking in restaurants will also make parents such as maybe the father or mother whom smokes but because of their kids love this particular restaurant, they will have to forgo their urge to smoke and slowly eventually quit smoking for good. Hence, banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country might be a good thing to curb the smokers' population and to create barriers to entry for the new smokers hence the population of smokers will decline and this will be a more well off social environment for the younger generations.
