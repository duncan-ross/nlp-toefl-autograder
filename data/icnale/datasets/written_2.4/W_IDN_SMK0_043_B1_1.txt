Nowadays, smoking is debatable topic for talking. Some people agree that smoking should be banned, but in the other hand some people disagree whether smoking should not be banned. In my opinion, government should not ban smoking activity as you know cigarette can increase the income of our country, both from the export to foreign country and also import to our country. The tax can be used to fulfill the needs of our country such as for allocate the payment of fuel cost, for building the facilities of our country better, for increasing the salary of the employee and many other function. Talking about smoking at restaurant it becomes controversial case because some people want to be free from the smog of cigarette. But other people also want to smoke moreover for active smoker. Therefore, they think that smoking should be banned because it can destroy other visitors. In the other hand, we have to think if the government ban the smoking it can make the production of cigarette will be lower than before. I am sure if the production is lower the factory will fire their employee from their work. It is so ironic. There will be so many people that cannot work again. They cannot fulfill their financial side. They cannot send their children to go to school, they also can not fulfill their daily needs. Therefore, I think the government should not ban the smoking case because it has many advantages for us, although there are many negative side that can appear from this case. As a smart people, we have to create the good thing that can make people both of active smoker or passive smoker feel comfortable in the same place.
