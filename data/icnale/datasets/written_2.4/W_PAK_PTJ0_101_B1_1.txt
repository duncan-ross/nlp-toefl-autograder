As for as the topic concern there are two major things to be noted job or students and here the factor society is also important. In general part time job is good for students they got confidence, knowledge, experience. They learn how to deal with people or how to contribute in society. As in foreign countries students should have few hours job and it is part of their studies. It makes them more practical but is all these things effect their studies or not? In foreign countries students are without burden. In our society study is very tough its burden more then knowledge. Majority of students belongs to middle class society they cannot afford their fee or other eXPENCES. they are responsible for their families and after completion of their studies they are unable to find good jobs, because in our society there is a demand of experience more than talent. When there is no appreciation of their talent, no jobs, no place, continuously failure its leads for suicide commitment, robbery, addiction or such immoral activities. Its responsibility of government to assign scholarship for students or provides them good jobs. Any how, I am strongly insist that student should do part time jobs not only for themselves but also for the betterment of society.
