Smoking is very harmful our health. Recently, the government has increased taxes to discourage smoking. And The government's move is part of worldwide efforts to reduce smoking rates. It says the increases are meant to discourage smoking. That means we're gonna have to quit smoking. In the restaurant, For Instance every sits are non-smoking sections. That is a Korea government's policy. But many Restaurants are indifferent to this policy. Sometimes When I entered a restaurant, the restaurant's has a hazy air. So I don卒t feel well. I agree to a government's proposal. I crusaded to ban smoking. But it was a seemingly impossible thing because there are many smokers in Korea relatively. Therefore we launched a crusade to ban smoking more hardly. Korea's prohibition of smoking education is a little short. So we have a correct understanding of prohibition of smoking. Korea's government should introduce to prohibition of smoking. For example, When We smoking cigarette at public places, Policeman will invoke economic sanctions against. Like a penalty (more penalty). Also we're recognition will heighten of smoking. And Korea's government will make a smoking area in the middle of road. A Smoker has human rights too. We must respect the human rights of other people. So we think more carefully and deal with a matter about smoking.
