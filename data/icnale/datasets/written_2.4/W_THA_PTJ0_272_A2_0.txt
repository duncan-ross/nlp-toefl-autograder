College student is a person who have 16-20 years old. In this period student can does many work and can get money in free time from study. In the USA, college student must leave out from their home and they must help themselves in everything. Their parents will only support and suggest in their work. When they don't have parents they don't have money too. The part-time job is the best way for them. When they have a part-time job they will have a new experience. They have ability in use the life in social. College student have a part-time job they will have more ability than another. The part-time job give for college student and another person both the money and experience. But in the Thailand, there is very different.
