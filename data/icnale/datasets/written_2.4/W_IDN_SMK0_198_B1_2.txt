Tobacco related diseases are some of the biggest killers in the world today. Smoking one cigarette a day results in a risk of heart disease that is halfway between that of a smoker and a non smoker. Among the diseases that can be caused by smoking are mouth cancer, lung cancer, heart attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many governments are trying to deter people from smoking with anti smoking campaigns in mass media stressing the harmful long-term effects of smoking. Passive smoking, or secondhand smoking, which affects people in the immediate vicinity of smokers, is a major reason for the enforcement of smoking bans. This is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces. Critics of bans in the restaurant suggest ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of passive smoking. Many restaurant organizations claim that ventilation systems can bring venues into compliance with smoke free restaurant ordinances. Additionally, restaurant smoking bans may help stop young people from becoming habitual smokers and I therefore fully support this idea.
