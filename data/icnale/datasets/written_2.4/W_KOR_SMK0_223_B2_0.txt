I strongly agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking is very bad for health. Second, smoke makes me uncomfortable. First, smoking is very bad for health causing some problems such as lung cancer. As a farther of my baby, I am always concerned about my daughter's health as well as my wife. We usually go to restaurants for food and recreation. If someone smokes in the restaurant, this behavior will have a negative impact on my family's health. They have no right to pester our health state, but we have proper right to eat everywhere we want. Out eating behavior doesn't spoil others' health, but smoking does. Second, smoke makes me uncomfortable. Smoke is a kind of odor, which makes me crazy. In a restaurant, if someone were smoking, every people would vomit or throw over. It would ruin my day life and whole life. This could be disaster. In conclusion, the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is very good one. For those reasons I have written above. First, smoking is very bad for health. Second, smoke makes me uncomfortable.
