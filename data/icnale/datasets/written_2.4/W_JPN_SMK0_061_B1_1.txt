I agree with this opinion and there are two reasons to agree this. The first reason is that tobacco smoke makes air bad. I think that everyone wants to enjoy meal in clean air. If there are smoking seats that spoils delicious meats and we cannot smell and taste correctly. In addition to that people who smoking feel full before eat meal enough because tobacco have such an effect. When we eat, it is good for smoking people and non-smoking people not to smoke. The second is that passive smoking. People who don't smoke and children are unconsciously in the same situation that they smoke. Tobacco smoke that is out of the tip of it is worse for health than breathe from the tale. They are only in the room they are done harm. If room is separated or seats are distanced, that can't keep off completely so no smoking is the best way to solve the problem. In conclusion, the restaurants should be clean air places and no harm places. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the official places where many people gather. We can live a comfortable life if all of us think of environment.
