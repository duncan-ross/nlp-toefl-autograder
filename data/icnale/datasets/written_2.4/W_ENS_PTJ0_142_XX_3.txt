The sooner that students get a handle on what the real world of working is all about, the better. Quite often, we find that many students who apply for positions at our company, are either ill prepared or their expectation levels of what they think work will be like are totally unrealistic. Personally, I feel that many colleges are out of touch with current workplace practises and dynamics and are not sufficiently preparing students for what awaits them in the workforce. From what I've seen, students would do well to gain some real world experience before graduating, irrespective of what kind of job they may find themselves in. They would have a far greater understanding of what is expected and required when working for a boss and it makes no difference whether they get this understanding by working in a bar, fast food joint or the local car wash. Just so long as they get it, understand it and apply it. At least they wouldn't get the shock of their lives when informed that they are expected to arrive at work on time, go the extra mile for free and generally provide value to the company that is considering hiring them.
