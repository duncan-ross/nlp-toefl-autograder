Yes, I totally agree with that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, restaurants are public areas. Indeed, each one of us has freedom to choose what we can do. But we have no choice to refuse when we smell the second-hand smoke. Since we're in the society, we have the responsibilities to respect others. In a public area, there must be some people who are not interested in smoke, not to mention there's no other way to hide from the open area. Second, restaurants are the place where we dining, which means we would take a long time to chat and eat. When there's someone smoke, the atmosphere and mood of the meal must be affected, and what's worse, a meal often takes an hour or even longer. It is definitely a disaster to be polluted in such a long time. The last but not the least, the ban of no smoking in public areas is already announced. Officially, smoking in public is no doubt an illegal act. It is also a right for us to protect ourselves from second-hand smoke. To my conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, no matter emotionally or officially, to reach the balance between personal free will and the mass advantages.
