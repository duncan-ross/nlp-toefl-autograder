A part time job is very important to students, especially university students. Students can learn so many things that they would adapt for their jobs in the future. For example, they will know how to socialize with consumers and managers. Also, there would be very much situation occurring when they work. Students have to deal with that by themselves. Maybe they can't deal with it perfectly, but their partners would help them, and they can learn precious experience that has benefits to their jobs. I remember I had the first part time job a year ago. The job is that you should sent flowers to consumers, and tell them how to plant them. Although the job took me about eight hours a day, actually it was really easy job to do. In the job, I should socialize with consumers, so I know how to chat with them gradually. Sometimes, my partner and I sent many flowers so that we will have sense of achievement. To me, the salary of the job is not the most important thing, because I think I learn many other things that I couldn't realize in the school. So, I hope that the students of university can spent their free time taking a part time job. Except for the salary, you can learn more things. Go ahead!
