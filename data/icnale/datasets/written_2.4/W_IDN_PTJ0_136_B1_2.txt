College students should have part time jobs. First of all, part time jobs can help student to be an independent person financially. Having a part time job during a school time can help student to reduce their parents' expenses. Students can make their own money to get all their needs. They won't ask any loan from their friends and they won't depend on their parents anymore in fulfilling some of their needs. For example, they can make their own account at the bank while they're still study at college so they can ease to fulfill their needs. Besides, part time jobs not only give advantages in their financial condition but also give them new skills to learn about Time Management and Communication skills. Once you begin work, you will have different environment between school and work. They may be having several works or projects while they're working and it can help them to learn how to manage their time between school and work. They will learn to organize their activities in such a good time order so that they will be able to know when is the right time to do either their school projects or their working-projects. Therefore, they will indirectly get skills to manage their time. It can also help them to learn about soft communication skills. Not only they can make a deal with many different people at work but they can also know how to behave this kind of people and how to behave that kind of people. So, for all of these reasons I believe that college students should have part time jobs since it gives advantages for the students' life before and after graduate.
