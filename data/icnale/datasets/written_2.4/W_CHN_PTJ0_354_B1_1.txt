 Being a student in university, we've to manage a large quantity of time rationally ourselves. Many students ride the wave to take part time job after their series of everyday courses, claiming that taking part time job not only values their leisure time but also earn them a good amount of pocket money. However, things don't usually go as what we imagine. Many of them focus more on the job but care less for their courses. As a result, they would fail to pass an exam while earning a good salary. Students work that way just cannot figure out what is more important between courses and part time job. First of all, our students' toughest and most important task is to learn lessons well and get professional knowledge. That is what comes out first as a student. Nevertheless, it is not that we ought not to take part time job, but we should strike a balance between courses and job. Truly, we do have plenty of free time at hand. Pick up a job which is fit for our routine. Maybe the job takes 2 hours in Sunday afternoon, which means it won't occupy the time we need to go over our lessons and put a finger on relevant research into our major. From my point of view, taking part time job is just a way of killing leisure time at hand. Since we are living in our lovely campus, we have more than enough joyous ways of spending time and creating a period of happy memory. If job isn't perfect, why not try another way. In short, let our part time job well value our leisure time.
