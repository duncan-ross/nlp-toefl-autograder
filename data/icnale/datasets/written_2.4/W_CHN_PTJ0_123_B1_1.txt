A great many college students have part time jobs. From my perspective, It is important for college student to have a part time job. We college students are almost adults, we should be independent. In order to be independent, we must be financial independent first. And using the money made by ourselves can make us feel very good. So, having a part time job could be a good choice. And having a part time job also could improve our ability, such as communicate ability, coordinate ability. That is not all, part time job experiences are precious wealth for our future. Having a part time job can also tell us that it is not easy to make money. In that case, we might be do much better than others in making money and saving money. Some of us might say that we don't have time to do any part time jobs, the time for us to study even seems to be not enough. I don't agree with them. If we improve our work efficiency, and use our time appropriately, Then, absolutely our time can be no more enough. Also, having a part time job can prevent us from wasting time, make us spent time doing significant things. In a word, having part time jobs is a good choice.
