I agree with the statement that part-time work is important for college students, and I think most college student should have a part-time job. The only people that I know who don't have part-time jobs have very hard majors such as engineering or med school, and for them it is probably more important to focus on their studies because they will be building things and developing medicine, and if they cut any corners in school they might end up killing people later in their lives. The good thing for them is that they can find some opportunities over the summer if they're not taking classes so that they can still enjoy the benefits of a part-time job such as making some money and making some new friends. Most of us in the business school have part-time jobs, because it is required by our major. I think that other majors should also encourage their students to work part-time so that there is no unfairness in the college system and we all graduate on a level playing field. That is a basic tenet of American culture that everyone should have an equal chance, and having a part-time job is one way to do that.
