I believe smoking is a bad habit that society can do without. There are no long term benefits to an individual who smokes. The short term "gains" of a high feeling from smoking are really not worth the price the individual has to pay. Firstly the cost of the cigarettes, which is very high in Singapore, is a financial burden to the individual. Then there is the harm smoking does to the individual's health such as bad teeth, gums and the life-threatening lung cancer. Lastly, smoking does quite a fair bit of harm to the environment by contributing to air pollution. Unfortunately an absolute ban would not be an ideal solution. With the large number of smokers in a given society, a sudden absolute ban would cause more social harm than the benefits it tries to bring. The government would not be very popular in the eyes of the smokers, and the cigarette industry's economical benefits would not be reaped. I believe the key to reducing (eliminating may be too high a target) is education of the young. Before a smoker becomes a smoker, he would have been a non-smoker first. It would be easier for non-smokers to see clearly the harms of smoking before they taste the highly addictive feeling of smoking. Once they've had a taste and get hooked, it is very difficult for the individual to see that these harms are really bad enough to give up the good feeling the get from smoking.
