Part-time job is good thing for some students who have no money or want to spend more money. It can make money to students. Students can choose some work that they want. Some students may like to work with people, talk to customers so they should work in the super mall or the shop. They can help with themselves by having part-time job. I am proud for who work when they are studying because they must manage time between university and work. They have to do homework, and go to work. It's very difficult to do. Sometimes work is hard but may be good for them. They work now so in the future they are not poor because they diligent. I want to be a good person. I want to make money to my family and my. If you want money you should diligent and not lazy. I agree that the important for college students because in college no have child some people make up. They can buy themselves but some people never work. They don't know about tired and want to sleep but can't not. I want to work part-time but my family doesn't give me to work. They said, now you should study to be good and have a good job. I think same my family I should to study now.
