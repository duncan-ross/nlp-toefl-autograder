I totally agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country, because it is not only concerning smokers, but also concerning other people around them. Even this rule would be not convenient for those who smoke. There are three reasons why I support this rule. First, smoking would cover fragrance of food and people could only smell smoke, not their food. That could interfere with people enjoying their meal. Second, smoking would be dangerous for other people. At the restaurant, especially at buffet, there would be a lot of people, such as waiters or waitresses and other people who want to go to the restroom or leave, walking around. If smokers are not careful, fired cigarettes would make them hurt. Third, the second-hand smoke is not good for health. Inhaling second-hand smoke could increase the rate of generating liver cancer. Besides, to some people who have breathed disease smoking would harden their sickness. According to these three reasons, therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nevertheless, the restaurants also have to establish the smoking room for the people who want to smoke. No matters smoking or not, everyone all could enjoy their time at restaurant.
