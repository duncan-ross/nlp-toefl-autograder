Every time when I see someone is smoking, I will be always unhappy to him or her. It is not because I am unsatisfactory to himself or herself, but they quarrel between my father and my mother. My father love smoking, or said too serious a bit, he is hopelessly hooked in cigarettes. He doesn't stop smoking all day. If he has some time not smoking, he will be so painful that he even will be angry with my mother or me for no reason. For this reason, he has had words with my mother which is countless. What's worse, he doesn't just smoke at home; he even smokes in public such as restaurants and doesn't consider the others. Some non-smokers are always frowning to go far away. And when time is long, the whole restaurant is filled with a serious smell which makes the other customers very upset. For this, these managers have reminded him for a lot of times. In fact, smoking in restaurants has lots of harm. First, the restaurant is where people eat. Smoking in there will make the food become so dirty. It will be a great potential danger if someone often eats in this kind of place. And second, the restaurant is a public place, if someone smokes in there, the number of people who have a second hand smoking is very large. Especially, it is a deadly harm to the waters. A survey indicates that most of waters who get a cancer is because he or she has a second smoking for a long term. So banding smoking is a very necessary measure. For our health, everyone please contributes a little. Persuading the people who are addicted to smoking to give up smoking, especially these who always smoke in public.
