I disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons are given below. First, I know in some restaurants, they have already divided the restaurant into non-smoking area and smoking area, which has already separated the smokers and non-smokers. Second, if we are going to ban smoking in all restaurants, what about other places, such as bar, night club, pub etc. Those are also public places, banning all the restaurants don't seem to solve the problem. It is quite hard to define where to banned, and where not to banned, the boundary is hard to draw. Last, restaurant is a place for people to eat and rest, some people smoke to feel relax, some smoke to get focus, and of course, some smoke for fun. People smoke for a lot of reasons, it is their decision that they wanted to smoke. We should not have the right to deprive their right to smoke as we do not have the right to stop people from drinking, but we can try to give suggestions. The discussion over whether the law should completely banned smoking in all restaurants has been mentioned a lot during these years. I know that the second hand smoke and smoking are both bad for our health. However, in my opinion, I think the better option is strict the smokers rather than banning smoking in all the restaurants. I believe that if smoking is completely banned in all the restaurants, it might bring more problems rather than solving the problem.
