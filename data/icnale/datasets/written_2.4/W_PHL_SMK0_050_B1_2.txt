Smoking was never beneficial in ones ' health; this may lead to lung cancer to not only the users but also the people that surrounds them. The restaurant is for the public where the rich and the poor may interact. It is also the place where people can smoke freely. Morally speaking smoking in a public place is definitely shows no respect to others. Health wise smoking would greatly affect the people that surround it. For me, smoking in Public places like the restaurant must be banned for it shows no positive side in using such thing that would affect the people. The smokers who do not follow the law must pay the consequences. They must undergo seminars about how smoking can affect the life of many. They must also be fined with proper amount. Violators who didn't seem to learn and continuously do such action must be placed behind bars. The seemed law may seem to be too harsh for a minor mistake but a person would only learn if they don't learn it the hard way. They will continue smoking in public areas until someone like the authorities would confine them for their own actions. Smoking only leads people to sickness.
