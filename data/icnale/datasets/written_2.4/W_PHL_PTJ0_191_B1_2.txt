College students should have part time jobs so that they could help their hardworking parents pay for their chosen institution's tuition fee. Their parents may seem like they never run out of money but in truth, they do too. Imagine all the expenses they incur in sending their children to school, gas (if they use the car to send the kids to school) or transportation expenses, daily allowance, books, clothes, food, and so much more. With all the time a college student has on his/her hands, they could probably work for at least two to three hours a day and earn a few bucks to be able to lessen their parents ' load (in terms of money). It's the least they can do to help their parents. Ever since they were studying in primary and secondary school, their parents probably never asked for anything in return for sending them to school (except for good grades, of course). Now that they are in college, they should do this simple and easy gesture or working a few hours a day or a week to be able to give something back. They don't even have to pay for part of their own tuition; maybe they could pay for part of their sibling's tuition fee or not ask for daily allowances anymore. Simple acts can go a long way.
