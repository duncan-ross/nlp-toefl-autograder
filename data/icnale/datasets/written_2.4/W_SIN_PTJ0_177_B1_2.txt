I agree with the view that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, I feel that while education does provide individuals with skills and knowledge of different theories, it is more important to get hands-on experience through part-time jobs. Part-time jobs expose students to the world of employment, without the necessary commitment and responsibility needed, as compared to full-time jobs. Secondly, while part-time jobs may cause the students to feel very tired due to the division of time for work and studies, it serves as a constant reminder of the real-world in a students' world of books and studies. Thirdly, part-time jobs allow college students to earn their own share of allowance. College students are typically between the age of 19-24 and that is the age for the coming of independence, thus emphasizing the importance for them to take up part-time jobs and learning to be economically self-sufficient. However, some may argue against a part-time job, alleging that college life is meant to be the final stage of academia and hence financial freedom before one steps into the real world and that a part-time job would not only restrict their personal life but infringe on the full experience of a college life. In view of this, I feel that as long as one can efficiently mange his or her time, a part-time jobs would not be a problem to the college life, and can even serve to bring the individual many different channels of benefit.
