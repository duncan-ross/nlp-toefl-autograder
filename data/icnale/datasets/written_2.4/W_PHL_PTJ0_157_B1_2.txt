For me, it is important for college students to have a part time job because it will build their character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very easy for them. After they experience as a waitress or a sales clerk, they will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide them in the future. They will realize that the world does not exist to wait on their hand and foot, and that if they want to get something, they have to give something first. Customer service jobs in retail and food service require them to work with challenging people, but after seeing how things are on this side of the counter, you will approach the world with a much more compassionate attitude. Therefore, be a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. They will make theirself more employable, learn some personal, financial responsibility and they also pay their own tuition fees in the school as well as the school supplies. Some of the most students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management and at the same time budgeting money. If they keep their priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least satisfy them, they will be adding an important element to their future experience.
