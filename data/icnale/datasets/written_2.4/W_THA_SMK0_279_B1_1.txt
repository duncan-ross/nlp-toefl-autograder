I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, and there three reasons to show that I agree with. First, smoking harms your health because if you smoke, you will be a cancer or other diseases that will make you die more quick than people who do not smoke. Second, if you smoke in the restaurants, it will disturb of harm other people who want to go to have a good meal with their family or their lover and don't smoke. I think you will kill people even though you do not want to kill or destroy them. Third, smoking will destroy the atmosphere in the restaurant; you have to think that if you go to the restaurant what you really want to do "eat" that is the purpose when you go to the restaurant, so if you want to smoke at the restaurant, you should not go because you will destroy the atmosphere of eating at the restaurants where people use for enjoy eating. For the reasons that are smoking destroys your health, harms other people who do not smoke, and makes a bad atmosphere at the restaurants, so you must not smoke at all restaurant anyway.
