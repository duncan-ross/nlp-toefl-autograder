Part time jobs are the jobs which we do during our studies and in our spare time. the most big benefit of doing part time job is that we make our selves independent rather than becoming Burden for others. I e if a student use to go to colleges or school for studying in day time he can continue his part tome job at evening time and can pay his expenses himself instead of volleying on others or parents. in the European countries it is compulsory to do part time job while studding. no body stays at home for the rest every one use to work more and more and it is one of the basic thing that they are progressing very fast. Man can change his fate by his work it causes the sense of responsibility in every individual and a responsible person and a responsible nation cannot be down in any way. they just fly higher and higher while doing part time jobs the brain of one become more and more sharp and practical. in our country the concept of part time jobs is very less students just concentrate on study and do not even think to work which is high of laziness and in responsibility. Many persons do not study because of poverty but it they do part time jobs they fulfill their expenses their selves. in our country universities are situated in urban areas but when the poor people move to universities for studding their pocket money becomes enough as there expenses increases so they start part time jobs. Our Govt. should take steps to increase the ratio of doing part time jobs. I am sorry to say that some people are doing part time jobs by stooling the thing of others and by doing criminal acts. For easy living in this expensive era.
