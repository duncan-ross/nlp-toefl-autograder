I think about it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with that because a part-time job is a good experience. Money is necessary for studying and living. They can help themselves and parents to save a lot of money. They spend their freetime usefully. When they need to use money, they can use their money that they earn. Their parents will not be tired. Actually a part-time job is important, studying is more important. If they always do a part-time job, they will not have time to read books and practice their learning skills. I think that studying must come first. So they should adjust and divide time during studying and working perfectly. They should realize that they are college students now. Their important duty while they are college students is studying. They should intend to study for their good futures. They must not work too hard so that they will not be tired. On weekend is the best time for working a part-time job because they will have time to study sufficiently. In my opinion, college students who have a part-time job are diligent and patient. I hope they will be happy in the future. The way to the success is waiting for them.
