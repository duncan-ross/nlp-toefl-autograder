I disagree to the statement. Because for me students should be only be focus on their studies for them to gain knowledge in class discussion. I don't say that a job while studying is not good, but for me, if you can pursue your study even if you are not working then just go to school and study. I also think that being working student is one factor for them to have a hard time completing their stuffs in school like assignments, projects and the knowledge that has to be ready every day before going to school. Finding a job is not that hard if you finish your study should always be first for all the students out there. Well, let's say you have a job while studying, but what is the point of having a job if you are having a hard time in school that causes you to gain low grades? It is useless. My main point in this topic about the importance of part time job to college students is that students should always bear in their mind that education is very important especially it is one of the most-faced problem nowadays of the youth. Always remember that education is the key to success. 207
