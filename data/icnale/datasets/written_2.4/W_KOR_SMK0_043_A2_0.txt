Smoking was practiced by Native Americans in both North and South America as far back as 100 A. D. Tobacco was originally used by these people in religious ceremonies, but later it became common to smoke for pleasure. Cigars are also rolled in tobacco leaves while cigarettes are rolled in paper. The leaves used to roll cigars must be thin, smooth, and of good color for the best cigar. According to the study, chewing tobacco increased the risk of heart attack two-fold and smokers had a three-fold increased risk of a heart attack compared to people who had never smoked hate smoking. I don't understanding smoker. They are why smoking. Smoking is very bad thing. Smoking is hazardous to your health. It certainly wasn't worth the money we paid to see it. I hope to government outlawed smoking in all public buildings and street. I want high taxes have recently been imposed on cigarettes. Many smokers are remembering informant fact. Don't forget active smokers are passive smokers too. It's very disgusting and stressful. Hang out with people who don't smoke. I don't really understand any person who smokes. I can't stand it when people smoke as they walk down the street. The air is already polluted, so I don't understand why people want to smoke
