When we are studying in university, college or some school mostly we don't know about our fellow's background and even we don't know what's going on in his daily life at his/ser home, what the problems he/or she is facing with. Some people start part time job to support their families financially. Some people start part time job as they don't want to be a burden for their families. Some have to do this to continue their study and support their families as their as there is no elder person to earn. Either the elder persons mainly father and mother have died or not able to earn. Mostly in south asian countries it is not liked by the people that women should do any job, they think that women should do work only at their own home. If we come to know about people doing part time job. we should help them and encourage them. On the other hand some people also do part time job to just get money to spend on useless activities. Actually they are wasting their time, money and even themselves as well. All schools should give needy base scholarships to their students who are doing part time job and they deserve for it.
