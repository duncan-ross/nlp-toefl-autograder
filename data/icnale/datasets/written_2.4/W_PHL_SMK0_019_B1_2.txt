Smoking must be banned from restaurants because it's a huge sign of disrespect and it's very rude to smoke around people you don't know. And it's a fact that second hand smoke is more dangerous than the smokers. And in fact, a restaurant is a place for eating, not to party. And what if there are people with asthma? Only a small amount of smoke they will inhale, they could die in a blink of an eye. And besides, there's a proper place for smoking. A restaurant is not a place for smoking; it's a place for eating. And there are small children's there; they might be influenced to smoke as well. Another reason why smoking must be banned from restaurants is because; smoking is dangerous for your health. Why even bother smoking if there's food around you. I don't get the point of smoking when it can harm your health while you can just eat foods because they are good for your health and it can also satisfy you as well. But you can't blame the smokers because for them, it's a way to relieve stress. And even though you are a smoker, it doesn't mean that you're bad.
