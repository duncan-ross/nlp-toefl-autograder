 As is the common phenomenon, many people tend to smoke before and after meals in restaurants, thus influencing other people more or less. However, I don't agree completely ban smoking at all restaurants. First of all, I strongly doubt it can be accomplished. Imagine there are countless restaurants all over the county and countless people eat in them. How can we conduct this order in reality, by force? I don't think it's proper. And most restaurant are not willing to do it for it may drive many customers away. Above all customers are free to smoke, and they deserve the rights to enjoy the rights which doesn't harm others obviously, either. So the communication between waiters and customers who are likely to stick to their own ideas remain to be trouble. Besides, we can't ban a thing just because of its slight harm. Needless to say, the cigarette producing has made up the great shares in GDP. And if we ban smoking in restaurants, the producing must decrease sharply. What's more, as we know, the emissions from cars do great harm to our health, can we ban car driving in the street? Furthermore, it has become a habit to give cigarettes to others to show your respect. It is also a part of table manners. So people may naturally take out cigarettes at meals. Once a tradition is deeply rooted in everyone's heart, the first thing we can do is not to ban it but to improve or change it. So I think we can invent some healthy cigarettes to solve it. Or we can divide the restaurant into several parts, in some of which smoking is allowed. So considering the current situation, I don't think to ban smoking in all restaurants is proper.
