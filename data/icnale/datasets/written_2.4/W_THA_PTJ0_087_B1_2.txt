It is not necessary. I think the part time job interferes with school hours and not do anything serious in both could cause both the poor should be. The bad grades came out and did not fully work. The work will make us too tired and do not have time to read books. Now our mission is intended for students to have good grades can have a good job and secure. If we do both simultaneously. We may lose the opportunity to good work at the future. It will cause negative effects in the long run when we graduated. However, if families have financial problems, we should be able to raise funds to help with that or loans for education. In the future, if we have to do a good job, we will be able to take care of our parents. But if we do not have a stable job, it will not be able to feed them our best when they get old and may be a burden on them. So I think that there is no need for the part time job during being student. What should we do now is commitment to a stable course for the future. It would be beneficial over the long term and should make us more successful in life.
