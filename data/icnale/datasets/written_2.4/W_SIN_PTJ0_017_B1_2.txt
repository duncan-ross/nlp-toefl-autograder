To, a large extent, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part- time job. Part time jobs are job that are done for a short period of time. It may not be the person true interest but nevertheless, there are several reason for having a part time job during school holiday. Firstly, college students would learn important skills that are not taught in school. School taught us important academic knowledge that is needed to survive in the workforce. However, it does not teach us the essential survival skills in the workforce. Some of the essential skills are soft skill like communication and building rapport with colleagues. Secondly, part time job can act as a form of internship for the students' curriculum. Students would be able to apply the knowledge imparted in school to real life application. More often, it would have positive effect towards students learning process as they would be able to understand the concept better through real life situation. Thirdly, the students are more prepared for the workforce by doing part time job. This is because they would know what the required skill is and how people survive in their job. They would be prepared mentally for the future challenge by taking up part time and understanding the nature of the job. Some job would require some form of sacrifice like time and weekend. Therefore, students would be able to know whether they are suitable for the jobs by taking part time to gain exposure. In a nutshell, part time has more beneficial than harm and all students should try to do part time job instead of being a couch potato during school holiday.
