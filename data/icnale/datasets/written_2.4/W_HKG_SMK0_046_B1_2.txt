There is no denying that smoking is harmful to us. Not only does it pose a great harm to the smoker, but also affect the non-smoker's health nearby. For instance, smoking has been proved to cause lung cancer, heart disease and other respiratory disease in that every cigarette contains more than a hundred chemical compounds and most of them are poisonous to our body. In view of this, Government should propose banning smoking in some public area, and sepecially, at all resturant. If you are on the street and you find that someone is smoking in the neighboring area, then you can choose to get away from that area and rescue yourself. However, when you are having meals in a resturant, it is not easy to get away immediately. You need endure to smoke passively. But we are indeed innocent! We also have the right to enjoy fresh and clean air but this right is deprived by smokers who gain pleasure at the expense of others. Also, banning smoking in restaurants may have a prospective increase in the group of patrons who do not smoke. Afteer all, the proportion of non-smokers is still larger than that of smokers. In conclusion, I do support banning smoking in all restaurants.
