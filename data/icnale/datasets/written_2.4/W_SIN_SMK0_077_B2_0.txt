Smoking should definitely be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The widely recognized harm that second-hand smoking poses endangers others' health. It is unethical based on the universal law to cause harm to a greater amount of people because of the enjoyment that only one gains. The possible health risks of secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease. Children that are constantly exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to be hospitalized when they have the flu. On top of the health risk, there are also political implications. When the government clamps down on smoking, it represents the strong stance it has on the welfare of its people. There would be no compromise with the general health of its people. However, it may also be viewed as too authoritative. Smokers may argue that they have the right to smoke in places they spend money on. However, taking into account for the greater good, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. The eating environment in restaurants will be improved and non-smokers can enjoy eating their meal in peace. Kids in family-friendly restaurants would not be exposed to the unhealthy sights of adult smoking and adults would be forced not to smoke in front of their child during meals in restaurants.
