I don't totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think it's quite hard to completely ban all the restaurants in the country, and the age of smoking seems getting lower and lower than before. There more and more post for avoiding the raising population of smoking. Government even raises the price of tobacco. Although I don't think ban all the restaurants in the country works, but restaurants in the country can have a place, room inside the restaurant or place outside the restaurant, for people who smoke. I think that the smell of smoke is hard to bear for many people. Could you image that while your family or friends and you are having good time and enjoy the meal, someone is smoking around you? I bet you don't like it, right? I don't like it either. Because having a meal with friends, family or even alone in a restaurant is to have a pleasant time without disturbance. Besides smoking is bad for health and the people who near can be even worse. People who smoke should learn and show the respect to others. I believe that it doesn't need to ban anything if people have more respect to others.
