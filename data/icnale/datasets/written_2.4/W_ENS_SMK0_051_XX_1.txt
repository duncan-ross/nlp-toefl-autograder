As with my last response, I feel that it is much easier to rely on numbers than it is to make qualitative arguments that have no real basis. I have to admit that I am not as well educated on the subject of smoking and I have not recently read any news about the subject, but I would venture to say that an overwhelming majority of people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants. That's it. No more discussion. We live in a democratic society, and I am not sure if Japan as a democratic society as well, but if the majority of people there think smoking should be banned in restaurants too, then they should just do it. By living in a democratic society, we have agreed to support the idea that the majority rules. One thing that makes this difficult, however, is that most democratic societies also put a strong emphasis on freedom of speech and action. No one should be persecuted for their beliefs or for their actions, and so in some ways it is difficult to approach this object in a completely satisfactory way. Nonetheless, if the majority of Japanese people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants, it should.
