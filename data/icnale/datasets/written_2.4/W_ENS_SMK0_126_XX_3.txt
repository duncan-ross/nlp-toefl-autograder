I believe that this would be an infringement upon both the proprietors and the customer's civil rights. While I can certainly understand health and escalating insurance fee concerns, I believe that the choice of smoking in restaurants is up to individual preference. Nobody could argue effectively that smoking is not dangerous, both to those who smoke or indeed, for those around them. Many health studies have already provided irrefutable, scientific evidence that smoking can kill and that passive smoking i. e. inhaling secondary smoke in the surrounding air, is just as risky. However, as true as that may be, individuals still have the right to choose under a democratic government. I do concede that issues like crime etc, are not and should not be up for debate as these are commonsense matters that should be banned. My point being, that while tobacco remains a legal substance under Japanese law which, is freely available to legal age purchasers at any public convenience store or public vending machine, then it would be rather contradictory and hypocritical, to introduce a complete ban on restaurant smoking when they are open for business to the general public. Just the same is it would be if alcohol came under a restaurant ban Japan wide. I strongly believe that Japanese restaurants should be forced to introduce more stringent measures to protect non-smoking patrons and also provide for the comfort of legal smokers. Simply sending smokers outside or forcing them into small, glass rooms with poor ventilation and inadequate smoke removal appliances, is unacceptable. Conversely, seating non-smokers next to smoking tables or sections is totally ineffective and simply serves as a aesthetic effect only. As stated, a ban is not acceptable, but regulated restaurant environmental control, should be mandatory.
