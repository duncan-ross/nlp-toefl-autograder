I agree to have part time job. It reduces my parents work load and I can make my free time to be useful. And also get paid. And have experience. And part time job should be on a weekend or after school. And should not encroach learning can lead to a compensation payment of fees. I had to spend money for myself from capability and be very proud for own self. I think students in Thailand don't want to work, and it's not popular to work when studying. I think it's a good thing to do. but Thai students may want to learn more than work. We learn a lot, and it's very serious. When I have the test. I have to read many books. I and my friends have no time to go out or hang out. I don't understand why we study a lot. After graduate, we work in company and get pay not too much. I think some part time job is very good. But when we study we have to be a trainee in some company. But we don't get paid. But we have certificate to guarantee our self. If we want to have more money, we should try to do part time job. There are many restaurants here, we can have tips and we don't worry to ask with parents.
