In modern sociaty, more and more people go to the restaurants instead of having meals at home. So it is important for us to choice the restaurants. For example, the hygience of restaurants and price, distance... so on. Most importantly to me is that smoking should be banned in restaurants or the restaurants have no smoking region. Smoking in the restaurants is very impolite and disrespect to people who eat in the restaurants. Everyone knows smoking is unhealthy to body. The restaurants are public areas so smoking should be banned completely. Smoke will through air condition spread in all the restaurant. Second-hand smoke is also unhealthy to people. If people want to smoking in the restaurants, we should suggest them not to do it and thy can smoking in outside. Smoking people have to respect other people in the restaurants. I think our government must promote not smoking in the restaurants and make law to ban smoking in the restaurants. If some people are illegal, we should punish them by fined. After all, smoking brins out second-hand smoke and unconfortance to people and teir health. Even though, I eat at restaurants beside smoking people, I'll feel not good and unhappy. Most people don't like smoke so it is essencial to ban smoking in the restaurants. All I want is have good time in the restaurants
