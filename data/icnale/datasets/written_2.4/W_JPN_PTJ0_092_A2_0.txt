I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because some of them may need it to earn money for the cost of living and school expenses. So I don't receive remittance from my parents, I intend to do it, too. In addition, we should experience the rule of society. It will link to making new friends except them in our college, and to get used to hierarchy early. It may be useful for employment in future, too. However a part-time job has some defect which we must be careful about. If my grade falls because of it, I must consider having it again. For college students, the grade is more important than it, and we must not forget that students' main occupation is study. Students who can't take care of themselves should get a scholarship, or they should not have a part-job until they have a stable school life. Therefore I agree that college students have a part-time job, but I think that students who don't have a ability that they can take care of themselves should not have it.
