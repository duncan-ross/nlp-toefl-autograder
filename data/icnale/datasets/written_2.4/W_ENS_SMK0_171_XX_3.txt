I agree and in addition to bans, I would also like to see included some'smokers will be shot on sight' legislation or have their pictures put on posters and sent to every prefecture in Japan. What nonsense is this now? The statement of banning smoking in all restaurants in Japan would be a joke if it wasn't so pathetic. Aside from ensuring that restaurants comply with local health regulations, what business is it of the Japanese Government, if restaurateurs choose to allow or disallow smoking on their premises when they are after all, private enterprises and not government cafeterias. I am assuming of course that only the Japanese Government has the legal authority to introduce such a ban. Since most restaurants are usually private enterprises and if they do in fact, meet all health and regulatory requirements, doesn't it then follow that the decisions related to legal activities conducted on their premises such as smoking, singing and dancing fall back to them. If this is not the case, then it would seem to be an exercise in futility to open a private business that is owned privately but is really run by the government. Something wrong with that logic I think.
