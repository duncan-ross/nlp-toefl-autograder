My dream is a police officer. For now that dream is a student of Deleon University Police Department. Ever since I was little my career was a fixed. When I was a kid was a police officer, she looks amazing. But it's nice now, by showing only the selected length of the innocent victims of crime want to be a police officer wanted to reduce. Although significantly reduce the crime rate in Korea, even if we once again by my patrol crime than any other cop would not be a person hope. Competent and diligent and smart but lazy, a police officer than a police one with the correct idea of the Republic of Korea will change the way crime is considered. And with this idea to increase police officers of the Republic of Korea believe that the crime rate will decrease significantly. In order to achieve my dream this summer, I decided to participate in study groups. For this study, the group in February next year, a group of police officials are preparing for exams. Lessons with five subjects studied, and once a week and look at the test. You've got passion, willpower is weak to me, and I think I am going to be a good opportunity.
