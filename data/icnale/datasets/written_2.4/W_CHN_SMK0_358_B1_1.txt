I don't share the same opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. As is known to us all, smoking does great harm to the smokers and it is even more serious for those who are around the smokers. With the rise on awareness of health protection, there are sever regulations on smoking in many public places such as hospitals, airports, etc. As is the case with some restaurants. However, if we prohibit smoking in restaurant at all, there will arise many problems and inconvenience. First of all, it is unfair for those who smoke. Just like my daddy, it is so difficult for him to quit smoking that he failed doing that again and again. I know clearly how hard it is for him to spend any one more minute when he want to smoke. So once smoking is totally banned in restaurant maybe my father will never dine out any longer. What is more, many people may try to break the rules resulting from not smoking for a long time. Thus it will cause loads of unnecessary problems. So how to solve this problem? In my opinion, we just need to set another room for those who smoke specifically then we can all enjoy a happy time together.
