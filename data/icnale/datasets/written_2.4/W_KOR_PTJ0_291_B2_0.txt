I think that a part time job is important for college students. Maybe a college students who doing part time job is very busy, so he or she is not enough time to study and get a not good grade. But doing a part time job is have lots of good thing. The part time job is give a chance to experience. The experience at the part time job is helpful to know one's aptitude. And later when he of she is choose his or hers profession, that is very helpful. We don't know about career well. We just learn theory of major. So we know the theory but don't know how to use the theory in job. A part time job is able to desolve that problem. You can use your theory in work. And a part time job is increase the independence. The biggest reason of doing a part time job is the make money. If you make money to part time job, you can financially independene of your parent. Maybe the pay is very little. But you feel very proud of you because you make money by yourself. So I think a part time job is very important for college students.
