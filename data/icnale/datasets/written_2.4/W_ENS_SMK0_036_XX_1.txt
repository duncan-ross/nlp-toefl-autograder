It would be a great idea to ban smoking at Japanese restaurants. I think this for three reasons. First of all, smoking is extremely dangerous for the health of everyone around it. As a result, I do not think it is fair for the habit of a few to affect the health of many. Also, smoking can negatively affect the experience one might have had a restaurant. One enormous part of any gourmet experience is a variety of smells one can enjoy in addition to the taste of the food, and cigarette smoke absolutely destroys this part of the experience. Next, smoking is a very expensive habit, and smokers may spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars every year is to buy cigarettes. I think this money could be spent much more well and some other way, and it would be an interesting experiment for any smoker to save all the money they would have spent on smokes for an entire year and then see how much they had accumulated. My guess is that it would probably be enough for a vacation or something else similarly large. Last, smoking can damage the actual interior of a restaurant, as smoke is very bad four walls, upholstery, and floors. Therefore, smoking should be banned at restaurants.
