Those who are banned smoking at all the restaurant might feel unfair and illiberal that why I cannot do whatever I like and want in this democracy country. The main reason for banning smoking at all the restaurant is that smoking will harm others seriously, which is more unfair than cannot doing whatever smokers like and want to do. According to science reports, those who get second hand smoke will get worse health condition than those who smoke. Restaurants are public arrears and some are inside and closed areas, the air not flowing, so if one is smoking, all people, no matter children, pregnant women elders or dogs will "share" the health harmful smoke together, which is really painful and unbearable for those who do not smoke. Smokers surely can smoke freely in private spaces like home and own car, but when it comes to restaurants these public areas, for everyone's health good, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Doing something to harm others is not fair and liberal, instead; be considerate and thoughtful to take care others' health is truly fair and liberal in this democracy country. So next time when you want to smoke in the restaurant, please bear the desire, all people in the restaurant will appreciate your consideration.
