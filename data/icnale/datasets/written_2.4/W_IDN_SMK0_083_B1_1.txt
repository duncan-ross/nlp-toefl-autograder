Of course it is not good for your healthy. Some people may not carry about that and keep smoking. In fact people who breath the smoke more dangerous than people who smoking, so smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. The first place that must be banned for smoking is restaurant. Because the smoke can make someone is not enjoying his food and can't eat. The second place is in the mall. Mall is indoor place with no window or circulation air. It just has AC for circulation and make it more cold, Because people walk inside for shopping. A lot of smoking are do not care about this situation. They keep smoking even can make another unhealthy. They do not care each other. It is just a human habit. So we must make as strong attention on it. Restaurant and mall must have board that written no smoking inside and make someone pay if there is a person who break that rule.
