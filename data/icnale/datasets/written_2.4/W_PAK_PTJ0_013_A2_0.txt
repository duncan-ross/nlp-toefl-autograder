Student plays a very important role in making the nation strong and progress. Students are the future of our countries so, they should be well educated and they should give better opportunities to achieve their targets. If students are well education they will play a vital role in the progress and prosperity of our country. Some students have better facilities which are given by their parents they studying in better institutions. This type of students is rare in our country because we are under developing country and the percentage of poor peoples is very high. So, the students of belonging to poor family and due to poverty they have not better facilities or not have enough money to pay their college dues so, they pay their college dues by working in offices at evening time or this is their part time job. This is the situation of our country and mostly Asian countries are in that process. But in European countries the children when they grew up the parents are not responsible for their financial status. The students are then working in offices as part time job. So, part time job are essential in that type of people. But for only enjoyment the students waste their time.
