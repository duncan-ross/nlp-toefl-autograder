I do not agree. It is very personal freedom. Of course, smoking is very bad thing to all of people. But we already have smoking zone. So we may smoke in the zone. Most people say, "Smoking is bad thing for smoker, but the worse thing is involuntary smoking. That is correct! But, all of restaurants abandoning about smoking is no desirable. If all of restaurants abandon smoking, many companies which produce tobacco are death. It is business! And it is life! Their life! Producing tobacco. . . Anyway, we have lots of smoking zone and lots of company. Why we founded the company and the factory that making tobacco. It is not make sense. Therefore, smoking in special area like smoking place or outside is okay. And that is free to all of people who are smoking. So, if we have no condition; like "Do not smoking here" than it is okay smoking in the restaurants. And it is fair! That is why this problem is not illegal. Free! It is very personal problem. Whatever! If the smoking person do not damaged another person, it is not so serious problem isn't it? Consequently, I think it is unfair to lots of smoking people.
