What exactly is part-time work? Part-time, to me, indicates that it should only take up a minor portion of a person's schedule. It should not be something you spend the majority of your time on. Work, I opine, is something you do for some form of monetary reward. I would therefore define part-time work as something you do for a portion of your available time in exchange for some form of monetary payment in exchange. As the definition proposed suggests, there are two parts to part-time work. Firstly, it must be "part-time" and secondly, it must be "work". An example is students teaching tuition for some extra allowance. The definition is important as "part-time work" has often been misused. Firstly, a manager preparing for a meeting at home is not doing "part-time work". This is because in his occupation as a manager, it is within his job scope that he has to prepare for meeting! Simply put, meetings is part of his full-time work. It is therefore, incorrect to label it as "part-time" just because it was brought home to be done. Secondly, a person playing in his free time is not doing part-time "work". Although it might be "part-time" in this case, the key here is that playing basketball is for his leisure and he will receive no monetary reward for it. Of course, the issue of misusing "part-time work" can be argued through the different definitions of "work". However, I would simply like to highlight on blatant and convenient misuse of the term "part-time work".
