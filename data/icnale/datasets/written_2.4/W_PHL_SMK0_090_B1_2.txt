I think that it is important for smoking to be banned in all restaurants in the Philippines. This is because we should give respect to our surroundings, most especially the people. I don't think it is appropriate to smoke in a restaurant where in people are trying to dine happily. Most people are not fond of smoking or cigarettes because it has a lot of bad side effects especially second hand smoking. I think that it wont be such a harm to smokers that smoking will be banned in restaurants, after all their purpose there is to enjoy the food and the dining experience. I think that it is enough that smoking is banned in restaurants but not in the streets just to be fair to everyone, this way everyone would be happy because the smokers would get to smoke whenever they want and the customers of the restaurants would not be affected by the second hand smoke that this brings. My opinion is based on my concern for the people's health and it is also based on my personal experiences where in I did not enjoy my dining experience just because of the smoke around me. I am pretty sure that the smokers would understand the situation if ever smoking would be banned from the restuarants.
