First attention of student should be to pay head on its studies so, that he can get better position in this society which there are some financial problems due to which student are compelled to earn for this expenses. In this way they can neither study nor work properly. As parents are responsible for their being these. They should equip them with the problems of life. It is the responsibility of parents to provide their children with every facilities of life which they require at that age. But in our society due to financial pursue, they are compelled to do jobs. As a result they fail and can not show better result in their studies. The students of higher secondary level in comparatively backward areas in the world do part time jobs, but this activity interferes their study. They have to work hard enough. This interferes their health. This is good fact in a way because in this way their education will continue and they can get good jobs after their education. And this facts is bad in a manner, because they can not get rest or spare time for enjoyment their lives become dull and boring. They feel burden after working. And they can not concentrate on their studies. They are the future leaders of the country and nation. Some student does their jobs for their taste so part time jobs for college is not too much essential.
