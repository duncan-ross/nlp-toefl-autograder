Smoking has been banned at the restaurants in my state since I was a little girl. I cannot even remember the times when people still smoked in restaurants, but my parents often tell me how bad it was, and how they sometimes did not even want to go to restaurants. I am one of the people who think that smoking is one of the dumbest things you can do because of the harm to your body, your mind, and even your soul. If you smoke, you will negatively affect the quality of your life especially in your older years. Many people claim that the lung cancer and throat cancer that people often get from smoking is one of the most heartbreaking ways to watch somebody die. The good thing is that if you are currently a smoker and if you quit right away, your body has the chance to heal and you may even reach a point where you are in as good of health as you were before you started smoking. However, many people have a very difficult time to quit smoking, so banning smoking at the restaurants may be one way to motivate them to achieve their dream of quitting. I therefore think that Japan would be well off to follow the example of Colorado and ban smoking in restaurants.
