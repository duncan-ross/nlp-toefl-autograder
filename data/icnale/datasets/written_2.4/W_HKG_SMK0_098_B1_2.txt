I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants in Hong Kong. The research has already shown that many materials release when the cigarettes burn were carcinogenic, and the harm to the second hand smokers is even larger. I think that the ones who smoke in the restaurants are selfish and ignore the health of the other customers, even the health of their family members or friends is also ignore. So when we completely banned smoking in the restaurants, the smokers will not get a chance to smoke and keep the air fresh and clean in the restaurants, so we can ensure the smokers won't affect the health of the others. Whenever they go where, most of the place has already banned smoking. So the chance they smoking will decrease, so they will start to consider quitting smoking. It's a better method to decrease smokers in Hong Kong than increase the tax on cigarettes, as decrease the chance for smoker in contact with cigarettes will be more effective than increase the price of it. At last, ban smoking in restaurants will increase the numbers of non-smoking customers in the restaurants. Most of the non-smokers hate the smell of cigarettes and afraid the second-hand smoke will affect their health, so when they saw smokers is in the restaurants, they will not consider to have lunch or dinner in there. That's why I agree smoking should be banned in the restaurants.
