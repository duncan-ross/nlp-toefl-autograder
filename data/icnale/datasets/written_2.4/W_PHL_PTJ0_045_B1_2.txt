In my opinion, I would say that I am not agreeing of the statement about the It is important for collage students to have a part time job. The reasons are; it affects their time, studies and health. Their time paying for studying would be limited. They don't have enough time in reviewing or studying their lesson; therefore they may have difficulties in following the class. I have few friends who have a part-time job, and they complain that they are too tired and sometimes do not want to go to class after hard working night. Consequently, these students will receive a not good grade records, therefore, this will strongly affect on the chance of finding a good job in the future. Moreover, some teenagers who have a large amount of money in hand may be easily involved in drugs, alcoholic and computer games. In these disadvantages that I have mentioned, you will see that having a part time job is not good for a student like me. As a student, we need to prioritize our study more than anything else. For me, it would be better if we focused first in studying and finished what you started. Because it is the best gift that we can give to our parents.
