Part- time workers are considered to be part time if they commonly work fewer hours and days in a week. Part-time workers may not be entitled in some benefits and privileges that full-time workers have such as 13-month pay, sick leave, and so on depending on the country's labor laws and individual business provisions. In the Philippines, however, the common legal part-time workers are the college students since many of the businesses that offer part-time job preferred literate workers that are in appropriate age. Majority of this college part-timers work to sustain their education. Education in the Philippines, tertiary in particular, is too expensive that majority of the Filipino families cannot afford it in view of the fact on the country's high unemployment rate and insufficient funds. I mentioned legal part-time workers earlier for the reason that these workers were hired by businesses that are legally registered to the government and therefore act in accordance of the country's labor laws. I also mentioned the lack of funds and high unemployment rate that may mean poor opportunity for the population. This poor opportunity led the Filipinos to strive whatever it takes to find a living. As a result, they accept jobs whenever there's a given opportunity on a short span of hours or days even they are paid less than what is standard. These workers can be called illegal part-timers such as carpenters, vendors, repairman, etc. that is not employed on any registered firm that only works when someone needed them. This kind of living can only sustain the basic needs of the family such as food, shelter and clothing. It can't even prolong a single child's education up to tertiary. Therefore part-time jobs are very important for many college students since it gives them the opportunity to study while working.
