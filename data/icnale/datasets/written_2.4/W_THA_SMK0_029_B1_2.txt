When talking about smoking, I see many people smoke around in everywhere. At train stations, bus stations, public telephone, markets, many smokers are there. In the restaurants can be seen smokers also. I don't see any advantages of smoking. If they say, smoking can stop their stress or can make them feel warmer, it's really unreasonable. Thailand is very hot, why smoking? Not cold at all. To release or stop stress? There are many ways to stop that. You may drink juice or work out, or do simple thing such as watch TV or sleep. Restaurants are places to eat and have fun with family or friends. It's for eating so the place should be clean and fresh. The smell of cigarettes can harm people who don't smoke and destroy the air in the restaurants. Food may be bad smell and the tastes become not tasty. Many kids and women or old people in the restaurant might have some effects from the smoke. The restaurants must ask smokers to go outside or ask them to leave. If they wish to smoke, the restaurant may provide smoking area for them but I don't support that. So smoking must not allowed in all resturants.
