My opinion about this topic is it's good if college students to have a part-time job because they can help themselves and learn to spend their life with another too. They will have experience for find job and know how to do work in the future. Although it's hard for do it and tired but it can make a value experience for them. And the important they can help their family for find money and make they know that money's value and must to hard work for get them. In the future i think they will save and understand when they will buy something they will think for useful of that thing much more than present. I am really sure that they will know how to spend money and use it value. All of the money they earn is from their energy and their hard work. So the money that they ask from parents and the money that earn by themselves is different feeling. They might not know how value of the money if they use the money from parents but when they have to use their own money they will realize how tired they are. They have to try very hard to get a single coin or get a buck or tips from part time job. I think these students will be grown up and reasonable every time they have to spend money.
