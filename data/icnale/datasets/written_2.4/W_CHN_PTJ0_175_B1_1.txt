In my mind, a part-time job is very useful for our college student although it may have some disadvantages. A part-time job can bring us not only the experience in our life but also the experience in being a true social human being. First of all, the environment in a campus is peace and simple, in these surroundings we could not know the real life in the recent society. If we have a part-time job, we should touch the society early than others, so we should have more competitive than the other. It is good for us to get a good job in the future. Secondly, we have the opportunity to meet more people and communicated with them. Communication is an important factor to be had in today's extremely competed society. The last but not the least, we can use our spare time to show our ability, we can make some pocket money, we can take care of ourselves which could make our parent feel relieve that we have already grown up. Many student may disagree with me, but I'll say that they do not know the feeling how great to have a part-time job especially you get your first salary. I could clearly remember that I have keep my first salary for a long time, I did not want to waste it. If someone want to get a part-time job, I will give him some encourage. Come on to get it.
