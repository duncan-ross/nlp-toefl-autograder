Studying is primary task for college students. However, it is also important to have experience to earn money and have a part-time job. There are mainly three two reasons for my opinion. Firstly, working through a part-time job can be good experiences for college students before they get a job. By working as a part-timer, they can learn how to deal with unexpected situations and how to communicate people who they don't really know. I have worked as a part-timer and it sometimes made me feel exhausted mentally and physically. But through the experience, I could not only make some money but also grow in many aspects. Working experience is a part of socialization to enter new world. Secondly, through part-time job they can learn how much difficult earning money is and they can also learn it is important and necessary to spent money properly. Many students doesn't have chance to work during their school life because they are really busy on studying. So some students do not know how hard their parents make money in work places. Therefore, they need to know and experience difficulty of earning money. To be prepared for future social life and to learn importance of money, I think it is better for college students to have a part-time job.
