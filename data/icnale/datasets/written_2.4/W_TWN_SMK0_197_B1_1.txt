Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I think it is necessary to do that, because smoking is hazardous to their health but also to cost money. Even so, there are still many people like to do it, they always believe smoking can help them to think to solve the question to mention also allows them to relax physically and mentally above the pressure and worry. Even if the expert report, cigarettes have many serious physical harm to human health, and even tobacco smoke is far greater than even smoking. The risk of these harmful substances, such as nicotine, tar and tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in smokers are likely increased substantially. And even then most people will not like the existence of second-hand smoke, but drug addicts or addicted to them. So I think that must be strictly prohibited in public places, smoking, presumably restaurants are no exception, because that is where many people out there not only for the elderly there are many children out of the habit of drug addicts if not prohibited, it would seriously jeopardize to these people's health. Therefore, no smoking restaurant in the country is necessary to implement things.
