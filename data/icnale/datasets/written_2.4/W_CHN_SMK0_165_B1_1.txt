As our society develops, more and more people are tending to smoke to relax and show their taste and status. But I think it is wrong to smoke in a restaurant. So we should try to ban smoking in the restaurants. Firstly, smoking does harm to people's bodies. Many cancers are caused by smoking. In the same time, it also does harm to the second smokers. People who do not smoke but smell the smoke are inflected as well. For your health and others' please stop smoking. Secondly, smoking can produce bad smoke and it will pollute the air in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place for people to eat and relax. No one would be willingly to sit in a smoke-full place. And smokers also could not enjoy their meals as well. At last, it is impolite to smoke in the public space like restaurant. Smoking not only costs money and time also the image of a person. Not smoking in a restaurant shows your respect to other consumers. We can see a person's virtue of patience from his behavior. A good person will not smoke in a restaurant. Although we cannot ignore the advantages of smoking like relax and joy we should forbid smoking in restaurants.
