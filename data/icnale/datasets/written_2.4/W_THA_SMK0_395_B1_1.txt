Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the sake of health of all. A restaurant is a public place people are around. Each person loves his or her life and no one can deny having a good health. Because smoking can cause an unhealthy life and bring a lot of diseases to health people, smoking must be banned at all the restaurants. Imaging when you are enjoying your meal with your own family at a restaurant, and someone you do not even know is smoking beside you, would you still be happy with your time there? In addition, smoking gives me a bad picture of it such as cancer, bad appearance, bad smell, and the like, and I am sure that many people agree with me that we do not want to die of a danger of smoking. We try to get away from those who smoke, and sometimes we just want to have a private place with out such a smoking-addicted person. Of their entire place or wherever no one is around, why they need a restaurant to smoke? Now I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
