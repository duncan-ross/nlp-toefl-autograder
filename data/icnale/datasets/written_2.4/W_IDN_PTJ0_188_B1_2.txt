In my opinion, for students who are willing to use their spare time work was very good. In addition to our experience increases, we also have their own income. And do not bother our parents, if there is a need that we want. And before we choose what is suitable work for us, we should also see the capabilities that exist in ourselves. If we adjust what we choose work according to ability or talent or hobby, it is better than doing something that does not comply with ourselves. For example, our field in the scientific field, we can channel it in a way taught in the course. Or we are interested in entertainment as a presenter, modeling, we can spend on our lecture schedule is blank weekend to do the job. In addition to developing the talents and abilities, can also be a side job we experience the world of work later. And this is also required. But if we are confused to choose jobs that fit with our time, we can be part-time work in supermarkets, restaurants, coffee break, or place that provides part-time job. So we must be smart divide their time between work and college side of us, not to all so messy. We must learn as much as possible by not relying on others.
