I am not exactly sure where this question is coming from, as I'm not sure my opinion really has anything to do with Japan, but I do think that banning public smoking is a good step here in the 21st century. Even just 50 years ago, people did not know much about the harmful effects of smoking upon the human body. Therefore, I don't really blame them for the amount of smoking which they took part in. A lot of my older relatives and a lot of my friend's older relatives have been smoking for a long time, and so for them it is very, very hard to quit smoking. I understand this, and so I do not get too upset when they smoke as long as they do not smoke around me. This is to say that if they did smoke around me I would be rather upset and a restaurant would be no exception. The fact of the matter is that smoking is to simply rude to the people around you, and if you have any interest at all in being a polite and otherwise good person, you should not smoke in public places. In conclusion, banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan would fit in with this idea.
