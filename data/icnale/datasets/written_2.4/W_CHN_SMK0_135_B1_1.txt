As we all know, in need of business communication, many people select to smoking in the restaurant; but I don't support this action. In my view, smoking should thoroughly be banned in the restaurant. I consider that there will be a majority of people standing on my side. At first, smoking does harm to personnel's health. It can damage human's immerse system and lead to life span's decreasing. Then, I think it is uncivilized behavior to smoking in the restaurant; especially when others are eating, your this behavior will influence others' emotion. Perhaps you will say it's interactive necessity; but I think you can entirely use wine instead of smoking, at least it won't influence the atomaspher's quality so as to effect others' emotion. At last, cigarette is easy to cause a fire if you throw it anywhere with dimming it out. In totally, smoking in the restaurant has one hundred harms but without one advantage. In addition, I really hate someone who smoke in the restaurant very much. This behavior will lead to my appitate's losing. As a result of this, I strongly reject this behavior that people smoke in the restaurant. Your action isn't your single one's action and it will influence others. Therefore, I suggest that smoking be completely banned in the restaurant.
