From childhood to adult, I have heard many things about smoking, such as, lung disease and so on. In contemporary world, we can see many No smoking signs in public places, such as in the bus, in the hospital and so on. However, there are still many smokers or smoke addicts. They will feel uncomfortable if they don't smoke. Whether smoking should be banned at the restaurant? The question has sparked an immediate debate. Some people argue that restaurant is also a social occasion. Many businessmen tend to talking about their business when they are at the dinner. It is unavoidable for them to smoke. Beside, smoking is a personal thing, and others don't have the right to interfere with them. However, quite a lot of person advocates that smoking should be banned at the restaurant. Now that restaurant is a public, smoking should be banned. If many people smoke in the restaurant without limit, the environment in the restaurant will become worse and worse so that people will not have a good motion to enjoy the delicious food. The restaurant should keep consistent with the hospital and bus. Personally, smoking should be banned. If the practice is formed, many people will follow it. Smoking is not only bad for smokers but also bad for the restaurant environment.
