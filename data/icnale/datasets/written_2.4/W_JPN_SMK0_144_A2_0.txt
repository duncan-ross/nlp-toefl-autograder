I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Tobacco damages the health of people who smoke and don't smoke. When there are people who smoke in the same room, people who don't smoke feel bad and cough. People who smoke will feel so comfortable when they smoke. But tobacco trouble people who don't smoke and they feel so bad. Restaurants and coffee shops are areas where we take a rest. So, people who don't smoke visit there in order to take a rest. But there are people who are smoking in a same room, people who don't smoke can't feel comfortable. I think that people who want to smoke should smoke outside and in the areas which are allowed to smoke. I think that it is a minimum manner. Tobacco gives not only harm to people's health, but also bad smell caused by smoke. Because of the bad smell, most people who don't smoke feel bad. And the bad smell remains for a long time. The bad smell cling to our hairs, clothes, and bodies. So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and coffee shops in Japan.
