Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, we've more people who care their health. We can see them from the fitness or park or swimming pool. But in many public places, you can find smoker, too. Not only park but also in the restaurant. So, how can we fix this problem? In many countries smoking is not allow in the restaurants because it's a place to have lunch or dinner or matter what a small meting group. If they allow smoking in the restaurants, many children and old people must get sick. Not only two of them but also the waiter and the smoker, too. Most of restaurants have place for smoker to smoke, if they want, they can go outside and get smoke. However, If smokers care a little bit about their health, It'll be good for them because we also know that smoking's not good. But if they still want, it's O. K. because it's their health. Smoking is not good in many ways and you can get a bad health, too. And I think, smoking should be banned in the restaurant is a good thing because restaurant is a public place to have a good time with family if it has something wrong, happiness will go.
