Because of the extend to which smoking do a great harm to individuals' health of physical as well as mental aspects, people have taken a great deal of methods to ban smoking. Recently the actions are being taken in restaurants all over the country. However, there are still lots of problems when the smoking is completely banned in the restaurant. some people argue that this policy is not considerate to those who have been addictive to smoking. And the owners of restaurants also grumbled that because of the demure banning of smoking, they have lost some regular consumers who have been conducive to smoking. From my perspective, I don't think it is quite inhumane to banned smoking completely in restaurants for the simple reason that smoking does too much harm to people's health, such as heart disease, cancer, and so forth, nowadays even on the covers of cigarettes, there are also the alarming words: quit smoking which will do harm to your health. so I think now that we are determined to ban smoking to make contribution to our health, we should ban it thoroughly and completely. Even in restaurants or other public places. To cut it into a nutshell, smoking should be banned completely in all the restaurants around the world, only by doing this can we make the meet ends.
