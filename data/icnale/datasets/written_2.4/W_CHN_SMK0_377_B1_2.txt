 I don't think smoking should be banned completely banned at all in restaurants in the country. On the one hand, we have to admit that cigarettes are harmful for both the smokers and second-hand smokers. But on the other hand, I think that smoking can be not completely banned in restaurants if some measures are taken. First of all, smoking turns to be most smokers' habit which is impossible to be quitted. For them, smoking is a form of killing time or way of venting their happiness or anger. On some occasions, business talk in restaurants for example, inviting others to smoke can be treated as a manner which will create a harmonious atmosphere. So we don't have to ban the smoking completely, to some degree, smoking can be partly banned in restaurants. Restaurants can design smoking zones for smokers. People must smoke in special zone so that non-smokers won't take in cigarette gas. Some restaurants can charge people more money if they smoke, which will let smokers try not to smoke in restaurants. These measures are humanistic rather than a serious decree, so it's both convenient for smokers and non-smokers. Personally, though smoking is bad for people's health, we can't forbid it at once because it has come to be someone's life habit. We should respect smokers' habit and also others' health at the same time.
