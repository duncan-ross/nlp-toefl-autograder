Taking up part time jobs seem to be a norm for many college students, and it seems to be widely encouraged by the older generation. They seem to believe that it promotes a sense of maturity, venturing out into the working world, and an indication of the beginning financial independence, given that they are finally earning their keep. But I do not believe that it's imperative for college students to have a part time job, but it's dependent on the unique circumstance of each individual. For starters, the basic responsibility of a student would be to study. That's the fundamental requirement that the college student attending classes would be expected to fulfill, to keep up with school work, diligently finish assignments promptly, and better yet, read ahead of lessons. This duty might be compromised with the introduction of a part time job, given the task of juggling between both school work and job requirements. The college student would probably not have enough time to produce the same quality work as he could have, if he were not working. Already compromising his education, performance at his part time job would also be lower than expected, as there would be minimal amounts of rest time available for the student to rest. On the flip side, there are students who require the financial assistance to tide through college and tuition fees, to fund their education. These individuals usually come from not so well-to do backgrounds, have no option but to take on the additional part time jobs to supplement their family income and try to reduce the impact of costs of college education has on their family finances.
