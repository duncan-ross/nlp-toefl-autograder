While some smokers claim that they need some space to smoke at restaurants, I oppose the idea. Basically, I believe smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. To begin with, smoking can harm not only the smoker's health, but also other people's health. In particular, for example, when there is a pregnant woman, or someone who has a disease at the restaurant, smoking can be a big problem. Because they are weak and very sensitive to smoking, it can have a severe influence on them. Furthermore, restaurants are public spaces in which many people gather, so smokers should be in good manners. Even if they really want to smoke, they should remember that in the restaurant, there is always someone who can't bear smoking. Therefore, smokers have some duty not to smoke in public spaces like restaurants. Finally, there are some other spaces smokers can smoke. That is, smokers can smoke outside, not at the restaurants. Although some smokers insist that banning smoking at all restaurants is limiting their liberty, I think liberty should accompany some responsibility. In other words, as they have liberty of smoking, others also have liberty of not being disturbed by smoking. Therefore, if they really want to smoke, they should smoke outside considering the others' rights. In conclusion, it is my belief that banning smoking at all restaurants is just in that smoking can harm others' health and non-smokers have the rights of not being disturbed by smoking.
