What is smoking? Is it helpful for a human being? What are its cons? Is it addictive? I 'm going to answer these questions on what I see in my everyday life. I 'm sad of seeing old and young people smoking everywhere and sometimes they don't pick the right place to smoke. Smoking is a practice where a tobacco is burned and the smoke is inhaled. The most common of smoking today is cigarettes which can be bought for a very cheap price. We know that cigarettes are not expensive it is still not helpful and not healthy for a human being because cigarettes contains drugs or components that can produce a very dangerous sickness such as lung cancer etc. Smoking has many consequences, like being an addict of smoking and the sickness not knowing it will eventually come out lately. When you are addicted on smoking, it is hard to remove it from your habit of taking even one cigar for the day. As what I see on the street sidewalks there are so many cigars scattered on the floor which means that many are addicted on it. The other consequence is that if you're the smoker you're not just putting yourself in danger but the other people to who accidentally inhaled the smoke you produce out of your breath. Smoke is more effective for people who inhaled it.
