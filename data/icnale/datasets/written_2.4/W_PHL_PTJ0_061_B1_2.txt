Luxury cars, big houses, pile of clothes. Who does not want to have those things. I am definitely sure that all of us want to have lots and lots of money. Therefore, we strive hard just to have lots of money. Some people take even two or more jobs at the same time just to earn more money. Part time job is a job that is good for people who wants to earn more money which is more applicable to college students. It is where you work for just a couple of hours and you get paid after your working hours. And mostly, those who have this kind of job are college students. An example of a part time job is working at coffee shops and fast foods chains. And in today's society, more and more college students have a part time job to earn money, and it is also a way for them to know that it is not easy to earn money. Some people think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help teenagers ' future become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money or in getting working experiences
