As of now, you can see almost everybody is smoking. They can smoke anywhere, anytime they want. But should authorities let them do it? They say it's relieving when you smoke after you eat. That's why they smoke in restaurants. Smoking inside the restaurant is really bothering especially to people who has asthma. Well, all of the non smokers don't want a companion who smokes. And it's really inappropriate to smoke in a restaurant. Restaurant is a place to eat, not a smoking area. Managers in restaurants should really banned people who smoke. They could really cause a lot of trouble to the other customers. And their restaurant can lose customers and have a bad reputation to others. Second hand smoke is more dangerous than those who smoke. Of course, people don't want to get sick, it's really hard for one to get sick now a days. Smoking should really be banned in Restaurant; it doesn't add income to them. They just bring their customers out of their territory. Come to think of it, just one or two smoker inside a restaurant brings 5 people inside it. What more if it's ten smokers? It'll bring almost half or 1/3 of your customers. It's like if you don't want them out, it's us who's going to leave.
