I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To be a student, we usually want to go out with friend, buy something we want, eat a lot of delicious food, etc. But we don't have enough money, so if you want to get this these things, go to get a part-time job and you can earn some money to buy things you want. Students can learn something they can not touch in school, boss doesn't have to teach you everything, they don't have to answer every question to you, if you want to finish your work, and you have to learn by yourself, to ask others, search on net. I have been taking part-time job for five years, it makes me knowing that studying is happy, not hard, and I can afford from my family. I work in department store now. I know a lot of people and I do not afraid to face with stranger, I can talk with them easily, even with foreigners. Sometimes I introduction Pineapple Pies to foreigners, it is fun, it is a good experience. When the semester begins, I work in holidays, when the summer vacation or winter vacation come, I work for long hours to make more money. Part-time job make my life different and think more. I like it and more and more classmates of mine start to find part-time job to make more money.
