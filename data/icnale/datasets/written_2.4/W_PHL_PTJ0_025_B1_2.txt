After graduating in high school, most students would enter college and finish a degree. Some of them may be enrolled without having any financial problems, but some does not. Some students have a scholarship, have a financial assistance, and some chose to have a part-time job. Some chose to have a job, and some just bluntly does not. Students working in the Philippines are rampant, and the number is still growing. Having a part-time job could take up a lot of time and it could be tiring as well. But in reality, do they have a choice? To continue their studies, they should help in finding ways to earn money and stay in their chosen program and university. In my honest opinion, college students should not have a part-time job, because they should only focus on their studies. Although countless numbers of students are working, some universities chose not to let their students be involved in part-time jobs. But are there other ways to help them? In what ways can we decrease the number of students working, and at the same time, studying? Like at De La Salle University, the school's main goal is to let their students focus on their students and not be ignorant of the opportunity to study in DLSU. Almost 15% of the student's population are supported by financial grants and scholarships in order to continue their stay in the university. Opportunities like these are gradually increasing and this is a great system for student to have their dream to graduate and to finish their studies in flying colors. So, what should one really do? One would only have to focus and work smarter on one's studies. If one makes this happen, one would be successful in the future and could help in the betterment of this dilemma.
