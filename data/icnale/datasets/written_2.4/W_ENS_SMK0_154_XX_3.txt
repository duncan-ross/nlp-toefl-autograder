I don't think that I can agree with this because here in the States, it hasn't worked out very well when they introduced bans here in a few cities. I guess that the air is a bit cleaner but now, everybody that smokes just goes outside so all that is happening really, is that they are just transferring the smoke from on location to another. One of my buddies says that he likes to smoke in the fresh air anyway. Seriously though, Japan has a lot of people and space is at premium so if everybody goes outside to smoke, then there won't be much room to move and they will block all the pedestrian walkways and in some suburbs, the small streets will be blocked as well. While there are serious risks for everybody that inhales smoke, moving it from one location to another is not going to solve the problem and will just create new problems. I think that the best thing to do is to just have separate restaurants for smokers and non-smokers. People can still eat the same foods and it just becomes a case of geography as to where they eat. Problem solved as far as the restaurant side of things goes.
