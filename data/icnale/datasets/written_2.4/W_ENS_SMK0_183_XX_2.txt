I agree with the ban and would like to see it extended. By that I mean that it could be extended to include any public place. Since it is general public knowledge that smoking and passive smoking kill people and cause numerous degenerative disease and heart attacks and strokes, we are left to wonder as to the continued delays in introducing such a ban. Particularly when it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that these could be prevented and leading medical professionals advise that smoking related deaths are the number one preventable cause of death in the entire world. One can only hope and pray that such a ban would be introduced as quickly as possible. The public for their part can continue to lobby their local congressman or their local government representative whoever that may be on a daily basis. If the government is moving a t a glacial pace on this issue then it's time for the public to pick up the pace and call their local representative every day until the ban is in place not just in a test case scenario, but in place across the country. I am not sure how much warning the government is required to issue however, I would amuse that it would not be less than a month before implementation which is ample time for restaurants to prepare for such a ban.
