Nowadays, the graduations of university are not always getting a job when they finished their studying. So, I think college student should have part time job. There are many reasons for this opinion. First, the part time job can help them in increasing experience of job before they apply CV (curriculum vitae) in looking for job. Because as we know, A company or organization of society will offer an employer who has many experiences in his job. The second reason is better for their society, because a great student isn't only clever in their lesson but also clever in their society, because a science will be useful if we divide it with other. The third reason is it can increase their knowledge,. As we know, we may learn some experience when we work part time. The fourth reason is can help their economy, so their income will increase and also it help their mother job, especially who has low economy. The fifth reason is the part time job can support their life not only depend on other people, so they can be independent and solve their problem by their selves. The last reason is it will make them easier in getting a job as soon as they finished their studying. It also can decrease many unemployed in our country.
