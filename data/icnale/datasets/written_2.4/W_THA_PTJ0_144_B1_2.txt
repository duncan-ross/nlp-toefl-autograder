I don't accept with this, because in Thailand, parent usually give their children money when they are studying. Parent usually think student must study full time, so parent don't allow them to do part-time job. They think it is not time to work when they are studying but they should work as they want after graduate. Someone said that If you do part-time job, you will gain experience. I accept with this but, experience can come from other way not only doing part-time job. For example, I can attend any activity in university, study about thing that I interest to get experience. I do not care about money, someone do part-time job because of money. Making money by oneself is good but, It will be bad If I can't manage my time or I work too much, I would be retired from university and I think it is not worth to try that. For someone who sure that you can manage your time, I support to do part-time job but for me, I will study fully to get good grade then I would get a good full-time job and earn money. So it is not too late to make money after graduate but It is important to get experience and knowledge when I am studying. And It is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
