I disagree with the topic of this essay. I think that college students should not have a part time job. We entered college to study and learn. College life is one of the most important times for students to study and learn. Because the lessons we learn in the college will be used for our future benefits and for our future job. And if we do a part time job, we will not be able to focus on our studies. We should focus on our studies to graduate the course that we applied in. There are several reasons why we cannot concentrate on studies if we have a part time job. We should focus on our studies instead of having a part time job. Because if we work in our part time job, there will no time left for us to review and do other activities needed for our course. We also will not be able to concentrate on studies because our part time job will make us tired and sleepy. If we are not able to concentrate on our studies of course we will get a low grade and fail the course. It is serious problem for college students because they might have to shift to another course which they do not want. Those are the reasons why we should not have a part time job, instead study hard and graduate with honors.
