I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. When I go out for dinner, I hate someone smoking inside. It's not only smell bad but also bad for health for everyone who breaths it and it's really hard not to breath it. The people who smokes happily but the else people who don't like and unhappy on the moment. It's so self center. Everyone should think of others for that it's the world we share together. No one has the right to make people do what you want to do. It's really smokers' business and they should think of for others. If they want smoking, they should go out to find a place without many people and wind can take away the smoke or they should not smoke inside. According to many reports about smoking and health, there's no any good news about smoking, all bad thins, like smoking make your lung to be black and hard or make you get cancer. It's too terrible that get lung hard or have a cancer. No one wants. So smoker should be completely banned at all restaurants to protect others' safety. It's a responsibility of the smoker for this society and everyone who has the right to their health.
