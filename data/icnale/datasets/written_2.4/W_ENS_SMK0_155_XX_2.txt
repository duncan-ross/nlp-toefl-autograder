It shouldn't just be banned in restaurants, Japan and every country in the world should ban smoking everywhere forever. I can't understand what people or governments must be thinking sometimes because cigarettes contain poison and when the are lit up, the fumes contain poison which is just being freely released into the air that I and everybody else has to breathe. There was a big court case in Canada a few years ago about a factory that was releasing poisonous gas into the air through one of their chimney stacks. It took three years and a lot of money before the courts decided to shut them down. Three years during which time, they were still doing the same thing, releasing toxins into the air. Smokers can do it and get away with it freely and easily and yet, what's the difference? It is all poison and it is killing us and those we love every year with nothing really being done about it except to introduce a few bans here and there. What a waste of time that is because if they cannot light up in a restaurant or library, then they just go outside and do it anyway. If governments and Japan too, really care about the environment and the people, then prohibit its use everywhere, just like drugs and let the smokers go through the pain of kicking their habits. Might help to teach them a lesson.
