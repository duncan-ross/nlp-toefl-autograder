I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in Japan. The trend in North America and Europe is to make every dining establishment strictly smoke-free; however, Japan should not cave in to international pressure. Smokers and non-smokers can enjoy their meals in restaurants by going to their designated seating areas (smoking & non-smoking respectively). Of course, entire establishment may allow smoking and others may be completely non-smoking. Because each restaurant maintains its own policy regarding smoking, customers can choose whether to enter or not in accordance with their preferences. Restaurants should be allowed to compete in the marketplace by adjusting their smoking policy to maximize profits while consumers should have a variety of smoking policies to choose from (e. g. completely non-smoking, smoke-friendly, smoking & non-smoking sections on same floor, smoking and non-smoking sections on separate floors, smoking allowed after 8pm, etc. ). In any case, there was a price hike for cigarettes effective as of October 1, 2010. This will probably contribute less smoking in restaurants without having to enforce a complete smoking ban across the board. Perhaps in a few years, Japan can revisit the issue of completely smoke-free restaurants, but for the time being, the country should let the price hike run its course and see the affect it is on the smoking landscape.
