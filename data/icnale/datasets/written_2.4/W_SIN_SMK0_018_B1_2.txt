Smoking is when tobacco is burnt and inhaled into one's body. There are many disadvantages to smoking. Smoking causes lung cancer. Smoking causes one to have bad breath and yellow tinted nails. Smoking is addictive and is a waste of money. The only reason why smokers continue to smoke despite this harmful effects is that smoking allows them to be high, and to feel good. this I feel, is outrageous, I do not see how getting lung cancer in the long run could make one feel good about themselves, and the people around them. This smoking behaviour which they deemed to be cool, is the most irresponsible behaviour one could ever have. All the smokers think about is those few minutes of feeling good from inhaling those nasty stuff down their lungs, and does not spare a thought for the people around them. I find smoking a complete waste of time and money. I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As much as i wish they would be banned, this would cause unhappiness among the smokers. However i feel that smokers should only be allowed to smoke outdoor. By smoking indoor, they can cause others to breathe in unnecessary second hand smoke, which is very inconsiderate to other users. As much as i wish smoking could be banned across the country i understand that a far bit of tax revenue comes from ciggarette, however is it rightful of the government to generate tax this way? to generate tax at the expense of its citizens? i do not think so. for the health of every one in the country i feelthat smoking should be as illegal as how marijuana is. it is a drug as well, how is it less severe.
