I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. If they want to make a law about smoking, it should not be way to ban smoking in all restaurants. Maybe it is better to ban smoking places but not in restaurants. What's the point of it? It is normal for some people to smoke after eating. Smoking is normal for many people nowadays I also mean that it is a free will to smoke or not. No one can stop a person for being being a smoker especially if it is his or her choice. I know that smoking is bad for one's health but who do you think you are to reprimand a person who smokes, right? It's none of your business anymore. You can do whatever you want but you should always be ready for the consequences. Smoking can cause a lot of complication to a person especially if that person is a heavy smoker. For me, you should always think twice in making every decision in your life. If you choose to smoke then be it, but be ready for what will happen to you. But just to clarify, I am not an anti-smoking person. Every person has their own life which cannot be controlled by any person except for their own-self. 220
