I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have three reasons. First, I don't like the smell. When I spend in the smoke long time, I feel bad mentally. In the restaurants, I eat delicious dishes and feel happy but if I smell the smoke, the happy feeling is over. Second, the smoke is very bad for our bodies. Not only the persons who smoke but also the all persons who are there are damaged. If we are there very long time, our lungs become black and its ability is down. Finally we will become lung cancer. the smoke is very bad physically too. Finally, the smoke erases the foods smell. In the restaurants of course foods need good tastes but their smells are necessary too. When I wait for dishes in the restaurants, I enjoy the smell. The smell makes me happy so the waiting time is very important for me when I eat in the restaurants, but if someone smokes, I can not feels the foods smell. It means that the worth of the restaurants become down. I don't want to say that people must not smoke completely but in the restaurants, smokers should not smoke.
