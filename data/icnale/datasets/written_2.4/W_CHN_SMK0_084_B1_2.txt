I support smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. It goes without saying that everyone needs a healthy body. If one is smoking now, persons staying in the same room with him are breathing in secondhand smoke virtually. The toxic substances don't only do harm to the smoker himself, but also to people around. Especially in terms of old men and children, the damage is too much. Restaurants are public places. I think gentlemen should pay attention to their behaviors and care about others feeling. Though smoking makes them feel relaxed, others are paying the price of their health for this. Smoking in public seems impolite. We should not neglect that individuals have rights to get protections. Our governments ought to take actions to regulate citizens' behaviors, such as smoking. In terms of restaurant owners, if a smoker goes in for dinner, his business might be influenced. Others who dislike smoke won't come to have meals. Also cigarette ashes will leave an annoying cleaning problem. What's more, burning cigarettes may bring potential safety hazard. To other customers, smoke can have a bad effect on their appetite, mood and physical condition. It seems unfair to them. You might say that smokers also have rights to relax by smoking. Well, if you are addicted to tobacco and can't help yourself, please go to Smoking Area. From my point of view, we all need a friendly and peaceful society. Therefore, smokers can't be free willing as before. Taking environment into consideration, they are required to control themselves. Caring about others more, they should behave well.
