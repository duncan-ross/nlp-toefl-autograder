I don't agree with smoking. Simple reason because it's nonsense it doesn't do any good for you yourself and other people around you, even cause air pollution every time you light your cigarette. I don't really know why human love to hurt themselves I think the reason behind that only anthropologist can explain. I hate smoker, my dad is smoking, my stepdad is smoking too. Even if these two person don't smoke I will have to breath smoke from someone else anyway. As I said smoking doesn't do any good if you're smoker you will have dental problems like bad breath, yellow teeth. More than that your clothes will smell bad also everything in your house. Nonsmoker like me will hate you. Every time you light your cigarette you're shorter your life time, wasting your money on what will kill you with great pain in the end. You won't stay healthy if you smoke and the long you smoke the more health problem you will have. So why on earth people smoke? Why on earth you have to smoke? I will start to accept you if you quit it, alas everyone knows quitting smoke is not easy. Like Twain said "Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it hundreds of times. "
