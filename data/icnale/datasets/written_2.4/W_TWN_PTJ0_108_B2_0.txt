As far as I am concerned, I think it's good for college student to take part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a part time job. For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. Because those textbooks teachers teaching could not be everything. Student still have to learn some social skills and how to get along with coworks. Moreover, it enables them to be financial independent and builds up his self-confidence. Therefore, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to know more of himself and of his personal value in society. As everything has two sides, the disadvantages can't be ignored. Part-time jobs cut into students' study time; some even become so preoccupied with making money that they can't focus their attention on studying. In the end, the students may fall behind or fail in their studies. That will be meaningless to take part-time. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation. The most important thing is for them to learn how to keep a good balance put his study on top of the list and assign an adequate amount of time to it. If they can do so, their life will be for meaningful and colorful.
