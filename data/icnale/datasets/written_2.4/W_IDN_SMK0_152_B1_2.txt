Smoking are very popular these days. Adults are used to smokes, everywhere and anytime. Sometimes they smoke just because their habit and become addicted, even they smoke at restaurants. In my opinion, smoke should completely banned at restaurants. What factors are influencing for this banning? It is because it can bother other customers, for instance children and women. In the restaurant, there are not only smokers, but also family. Maybe they are going to the restaurant with family, with their children and wife. When they smoke at restaurant, it can bother his wife, and the other customers that don't like smoke. Of course we all know that passive smokers (they who breathe the smoker's smoke by accident) have a higher risk of getting various disease than the active smoker(the smokers). So, when we smoke in a public place, especially in restaurant, we make other customers getting worse. People says that smoke is only for the adults. Yes, we all agree about that. However, in restaurant, there are children too. How can they smoke with children in front of them? This could lead that child looks smoking is cool, and looks very adult, then they do it. This is really a great threat, because we don't want our kids to get sick, because the wrong habit. This is not the child's fault, but the smokers. We have to prevent our child for smoking, at least until they know the risk of it. For conclusion, we should really banned smoking in the restaurant completely. We can try it by giving a suggestion to the smokers to smoke outside. By this small effort, you have one great step to give your child a better future.
