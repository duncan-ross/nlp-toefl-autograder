Is it important for university students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is optional that university students having a part-time job or not. I agree that having part-time job can benefit them, but it is not a must for them to have a part-time job. Therefore, I do not think it is important for university students to have a part-time job. Though working experience is a very important factor while looking for job, paying effort on study is much more important for students. Having part-time job will reduce students' revision time, which may easily slow down students' learning processes. Moreover, having part-time job after school makes students spend more energy a day, or maybe sleep less, therefore students may feel tired in lessons next day. It will also affect students' study. Rather than having part-time job, I prefer students to have a placement year or summer internship. In the placement year or summer, students can fully focus on the job since they do not have courses at that period. Therefore students can obtain the most from study and work rather than multi tasking both. Full-time job can help students to learn much better, it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job.
