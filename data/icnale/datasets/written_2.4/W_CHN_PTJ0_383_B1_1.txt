From where I stand, it's essential for us college students to have part time jobs during college life. To begin with, we get extra our money from our own hard work instead of totally depending on our parents, which partially eases our family's economic burden and remind us it's time to learn to be independent. Secondly, during the working process, we will learn knowledge which can never be acquired in school classes and widen our horizons while talking to different people in the society. Meanwhile, we become more mature and experienced by learning various social skills. Last but not the least, we can feel the hardness of living well in this competitive world and become more serious about the money we or our parents has earned. All in all, part time job is an important tool to improve our social skills in all rounds and having part time jobs does help us dissolve into the society earlier than other students. Some students are afraid that devoting too much time in part time job may affect their normal study process. Although the academic study is still our primary concern, no one can ignore the importance of enriching comprehensive abilities. In contemporary society, professional skills are far from enough, we should go full length to equip ourselves with more practical knowledge.
