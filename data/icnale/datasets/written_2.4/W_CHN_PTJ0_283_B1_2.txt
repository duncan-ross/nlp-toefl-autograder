 Nowadays, there is a trend in campus that more and more college students rush to find a part-time job during both the vacation and school time. However, I disagree with the idea that it's important for college students to find part-time jobs, because finding a part-time job is not as useful as people think and it depends on one's interest and expectation for the future as well. Not all the part-time working experiences can gain priority over other competitors when students graduate. Especially for those who are only freshmen or sophomore, lack of professional knowledge and specialized skills keeps them from over-reward jobs. Such works as being a tutor, waiter or secretary have little impact on one's personal capabilities in job hunting. What if college students plan to study on the graduate level or go overseas? There is absolutely no need for them to find a part-time job before they finish the 4-year study. In my college, most students go to work at the risk of quitting classes when they are still at school, which is a waste of time if they are determined to take the postgraduate entrance examination. Finding a part-time job is one way to choose for college students. It can be a practical experience as well as a waste of time. Whether and when to find a part-time job depends on one's own idea and his plan for the future.
