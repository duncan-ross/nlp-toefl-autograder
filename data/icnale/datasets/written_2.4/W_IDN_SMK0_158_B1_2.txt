Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant ? For this title. I don't need to think a lot to share my opinion, I absolutely without any doubt agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. Smoking as we know is very dangerous activity that will affect in long period time. The cigarette producers also put the bad benefits that is contained in cigarette. From that we know that smoking is a dangerous activity. Now I'll talk about smoking in the restaurant. First, not all the restaurants visitors are smokers. In the restaurant there are so many people from many ages. From adult to old age peoples. So, I think that smoking should be banned. Because the smoke from cigarettes will produces bad side effects from people that don't smoke, so they can be the victim of smoking. They can cough, hard to breath, etc. The air condition will be not fresh again and it'll disturb the air flow in the room. With all the uncomfortable things than can caused by smoking, banned smoking will be the very best way. But if it's not possible than the restaurant must create a smoking area for the smokers visitor, so they'll not disturb people who don't smoke
