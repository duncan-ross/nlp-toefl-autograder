I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, there are several reasons to support my answer. First, restaurants are public occasions, foreigners may have their dishes in several of these places, if too many people smoke, will leave bad impressions in their mind, and so that hurts views of our country. Second, it is same as I say, restaurants are open to everyone, of course, and mother-to-be, children, and the old are their customers. The chemical substances make by smoking will do severe damage to them, especially the mother-to-be, her baby get hurt at the same time. Furthermore, children may learn smoker's behavior unconsciously; it will make a big influence on them. Third, smoking sometimes may cause accidents. Throw tobacco leaf casually may give rise to a fire. The loss of a fire can't be count, if people get damage or more severe hurt, no one can be responsible for this accident. The damages to the smokers make by smoking can't be avoided obviously; however, it is unreasonable to ask other people take risks with them. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
