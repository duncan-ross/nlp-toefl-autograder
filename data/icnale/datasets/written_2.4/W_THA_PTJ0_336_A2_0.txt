I think a part-time job is not important for the college students who have enough money to pay at the university. But for some college students who do not have enough money to use daily at the university, It is so important for them to work for find some money. So I think, The part-time job is very good to do for everybody. Because if you do not have enough money you can find it from do a part-time job but if you have enough money already you can work to find a new experience. It is good for college students to find the experience from part-time job before they have to do a real work in the future. And I think all college student should do if they have a change and have enough time. It is not a bad thing to do something new. And for myself, I will do a part-time job if I have free time after study at the university because I want to find some money for use daily and I want to find new friends that do a part-time job before me. They will share their experience to me and I can learn new thing from their experience. As a result, I agree with a part-time job for college students.
