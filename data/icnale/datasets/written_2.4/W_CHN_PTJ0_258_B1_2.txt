As a number of employers from companies point out, hardly do college graduates know how to work efficiently, simply because what they learn from universities cannot be applied to their career. So as far as I'm concerned, it is of great importance for college students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, every college student will start a career in a foreseeable future, thus taking an early step in the job fields can help them adjust to a reserve life that is totally different from school days. For instance, we'll see our supervisors work and get to know how they handle their projects and how they deal with people, and that's what we are never supposed to grasp from lectures or seminars in colleges. Those working experiences can benefit college students when they start their own careers. Also, part-time jobs enrich college students' lives during their spare time. College students tend to have fewer classes and more free time than high school students. However, it has been a common phenomenon that the precious free time is wasted on chatting or playing meaningless video games. What a pity! So why don't we make full use of this golden opportunity and applying for a part-time job? That won't bore us at least, and we can have a sense of achievement via serving other people. Finally, part-time jobs can offer college students with a sum of salary, which can be attractive to those who still depend on parents economically. Technically, college students are all adults, whose parents no longer bear the responsibility to support them with pocket money. So they should earn money by themselves, pay for their tuitions and the cost of living, and most importantly to ease the burden of their parents. In conclusion, as stated above, part-time jobs provide college students with working experience and money in need. Considering all these advantages, isn't it a wise idea for college students to have a part-time job?
