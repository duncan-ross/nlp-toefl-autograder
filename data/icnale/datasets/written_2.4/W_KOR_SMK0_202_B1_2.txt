Do you like cigarette smoking? Are you happy when you eat a dinner with smoke smell? Almost people (both smoker and non-smoker) have an experience that they got angry at a restaurant and a bar due to smokes. At a recent, at many public spaces (such as government and public offices, high-rise buildings, markets), smoking zones are separated from common places. Unfortunately, many restaurants and bars allow smoking behavior at indoor yet. However, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants and bars because it might disturb others meal time and it can threat the people who are in those places. Smoking is behavior that gives other people trouble. Almost non-smokers hate the cigarette smoke, so they cannot enjoy their meals because of that smell. Restaurants and bars are not a personal space, but a public space. From my experience, I once went to a restaurant. Someone who sits down beside me started smoking. I could not eat well due to that smoke. I think such a behavior is very rude to the others. If smoker has a right to smoke, then non-smoker also has a right not to suck it. Moreover, it can be very harmful to a pregnant women or an old person who eat a meal or drink alcoholic drinks in that places. Another reason is dangerousness of a fire. Restaurants or bars are the isolated places from outdoor. It means if fire accidents occur in that places, many people might die. Because fire can be occurred easily by a cigarette butt, especially in a bar.
