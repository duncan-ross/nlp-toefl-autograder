Being a strong advocate against smoking, I definitely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking creates undesirable odours and side effects to the people and environment. In a restaurant, the pleasant smell of food would be masked by the strong cigarette smell and this will ruin the dining experience. Besides, the cigarette butts can be a cause of litter and this is creates an unsightly mess in the restaurants. The ambience will be ruined. Smoking also harms the harm of non-smokers. This is due to passive smoke which the non-smokers breathe in. If smoking is not banned in restaurants, then non-smokers in the restaurant will breathe in the cigarette smoke and this will harm their harm in the long run. Studies have proven that passive smoke can cause lung cancer and other diseases. Surely this is enough reason to ban smoking in all restaurants? In Singapore, there is a slow but steady push to ban smoking in public places. For example, hawker centres where there is a designated area for smokers. In Taiwan, the airport has a special smokers' room where smokers can light up a cigarette in an enclosed room. This will let other non-smoking passengers have a better experience at the airport and not have to face with smelly cigarette odours. Perhaps the restaurants can adopt this idea.
