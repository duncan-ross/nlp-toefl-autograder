A part time job serves as a good chance for students to learn how to socialize with other people. As a matter of fact, throughout their education from elementary school to college, students tend to learn knowledge rather than how to cope with others in the society. Although they become friends with peers, that is probably possible thanks to the environment that makes them face each other for a long time. In addition, students are likely to be of similar age, socio-economic background, or interest. In contrast, in the professional world that we enter after college, we are bound to encounter people from different backgrounds and cope with people who are higher in status according to the hierarchical system. For this reason, we are apt to face difficulties getting along with colleagues or bosses. Viewed in this light, if college students do part time jobs, they can experience in advance how the real society functions and how to treat coworkers. For example, working with colleagues, they can learn a sense of cooperation and responsibility, and communicating with bosses, they can learn ways to show respect, using appropriate register. Therefore, it is necessary that college students have a part time job, as that experience teaches them social skills which is necessary for their future career.
