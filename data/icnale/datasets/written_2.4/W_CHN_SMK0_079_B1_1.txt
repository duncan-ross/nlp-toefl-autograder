 In this era of rapid social and technological change leading to increasing life quality, smoking changes its character from status symbol to a kind of unhealthy lifestyle. In more and more countries, it has been illegal to smoke in public places already. To some people, it is not their own will to smoke. They smoke just because pressure. They suffer a lot from their work and life. They smoke to remove their pressure and to them, smoking is not a harmful-only thing. But there is still many other health ways to remove our pressure such as sports and it not necessary to relax yourself via such a harmful way. According to studies leading by Wuhan University, nicotine and some other chemical materials, which come from cigars, does a lot of harm to our bodies, especially lungs. Continuous intake of chemical materials from cigar may eventually causes the increasing ability of getting lung cancer. To improve the average health of humanity, it is emergency to help smokers out of it. In addition, smoking not only does harm to smokers, but also hurts people around, even more seriously. In fact, based on researches around the world, it has been point out that second-hand smoking indeed does more harm to our body. Some of the chemical materials are changed in the air. Some reactions will happened when they meet oxygen and become some other things and these changed materials will cause more healthy problems. In restaurant places, where there would be a relatively bigger crowd in, second-hand smoking is a much more serious problem than smoking. So it is necessary to forbid smoking in restaurant. So, in my opinion, it is best to quit smoking, especially in public places like restaurant. It hurts both you and people around.
