I agree. The reason for this is. First, it is their personal reason. I felt university student is so much time. But they didn't use their time. They consume time on play. And they not managed time well. That is they waste of time. Second, university student is spending a lot of money. Need a lot of money, but Allowance is a fixed, Expenditure is more than allowance. University student is not minor. So themselves need to be managed, Must take responsibility for their actions. If you need anything more than that It should buy their earned. I have also acted. Third, it is opportunity to Social experience in advance. Entered the University, after graduating from high school, the first experience Social Life is so difficult. However as experience is more understand in community. So am I, working part-time job social life is difficult, and I felt that it is difficult to make money. On the other hand I felt making money is fun. And I felt Interested in work. So part-time job is not must do, but I think it is maybe a little need? In my experience, part time job is feeling the importance of money. And it will save you money. This is our proverb same. No pain, no gain.
