I agree the issue. The college student to be possible to go to work, but they can not lose their major subject. The part time job can help the college student understands the real society, to accumulation experience and maybe they will study hard, when they had part time job experience. The university student will have the working experience to have the help very much to his future. If they can not decide goal in the future, they may find its future goal from the different part time jobs. If they decide goal in the future, they can to exercise their skill in the company, to do and to find out the situation, helps them after the graduation enters the work place smoothly. If the college student don't have goal in the future, the most common mistake is the university student wallowed in the part time job to lead to their schoolwork grade down. Maybe they will crazy make money and buy LV or car or something they like. They think money is all in their life. If the college student have positive goal in the future, the part time is useful to them, because they can use money from part time job learn their skill or buy a reference book strengthens his strength. In conclusion, the college student have part time job experience is important, it is can help them to think what they want and what work they suit, maybe art is their hobby but they are not suit be an artist, they can help artists popularize their works.
