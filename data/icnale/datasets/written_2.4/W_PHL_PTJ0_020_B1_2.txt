Now that I am a college student I suddenly realized how hectic studying in college is, all the lessons and the activities. After a whole day in class when I go home I still need to spend hours studying the things that were taught that day. A part time job is a job that requires less hours of work and requires less than that of a regular job. Nowadays it is known in the society that most students in different countries have their part time jobs while balancing their time for their studies too. If asked for my opinion I would have to say that I have high respect for those students who have part time jobs and yet they are still able to balance their time for studying and working. Being able to do that requires perseverance and dedication. They have to work hard in school in able to learn and ingest all the information taught there and they also need to be good in managing their time with their work. I think that having a part time job is a choice of a person and a test of knowing you better and develop yourself as an individual who has self-discipline and will power.
