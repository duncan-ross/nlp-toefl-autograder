 The advertisements that advertised by students hunting for a part-time job are everywhere. A large number of college students say that they want to get a part-time job. But there are some people holding the point that it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. The supporters believe that a part-time job will benefit students for several aspects. First of all, students can get paid through their work which can reduce the financial burden of their family. In addition, having a part-time job can make students more independent which may be helpful for them to get ready for the coming challenges. Last but not the least, taking a part-time job will offer students some opportunities to acquire skills and experiences benefiting to their future works. The opponents criticize the supporters for their lack of long-term consideration. They hold the point that students must spare no efforts to study other than concern about other distractions. Only by study hard will they be well-trained so that they can start from a higher stage. As for me, taking a part-time job can only be a choice to students has lots of time. If students can't manage their study, they'd better not take a part-time job.
