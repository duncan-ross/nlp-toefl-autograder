 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Nowadays, some governments have completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. This is a good idea though it is unfair to smokers. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment by giving poisonous gas off into the air. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters'working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants can not bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. However, many smokers complain governments have no rights to take away their freedom of smoking in the restaurants. I consider if they want to smoke, they may smoke in private, not in the public. They had better give up smoking because it is beneficial to both their health and environment. I believe if smoking is banned in all the restaurants, most of us will breath in more fresh air. Only in this way will our healthy condition be improved.
