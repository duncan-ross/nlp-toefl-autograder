No I do not agree with the statement. While there is no doubt that smoking is bad for one's health, banning it is not the way to go. This is because completely banning will open the floodgates to many other things to be banned. Other than smoking, many things are bad for health too, such as oily fried food and sugary soft drinks, should they be banned too? The answer is no. This is because whether something is "good" or "bad" can be subjective and relative. Oily fried food if eaten everyday will have very bad effects one's health, but if eaten in moderation, negative effects on health will be negligible and offset by the pleasure that it confers on the taste buds. From this example can be seen that every decision made has to be seen in a context. We are a mature and sophisticated society with citizens who can think for themselves. Banning will be too heavy-handed. Guidelines about no smoking in restaurants would be a better alternative. The restaurant owners should be allowed to make their own decisions as to whether smoking should be allowed on their premise. A great idea would be to follow Singapore's example and have "yellow boxes' ---designated areas for smokers. In this way, both smokers and non-smokers will be appeased. Just make sure that smoke do not drift over to the non-smokers' area.
