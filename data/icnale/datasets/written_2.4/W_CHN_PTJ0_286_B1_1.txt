 In my view, part-time job is necessary for college students. As we all know, in western countries, many young people who are 18 years old leave their home to live on their own. While they are studying in college, they make a living by doing part-time jobs. The results are that these people are very independent and it is easier for them to make something of themselves in their lives. In China, many college students have realized this and they can make some money. Though it may not be enough to cover their living expense, it can alleviate their parents' burden which is very important. As for themselves, from part-time jobs, they can gain much working experience which may be useful in their future jobs. For example, they can learn to deal with other workmates and get along well with them. If he can make some faithful friends, it is good for his future. From part-time job, he may know about the hardship of working. Thus on one hand, he may have a strong will to study well and find a good job in the future. On the other hand, when he leave university to devote himself to his work, he may find it is easier for him to adjust to the hard work. In one word, part-time job is necessary for college students and we can learn a lot from it which may be very useful for our future.
