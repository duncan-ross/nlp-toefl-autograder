Where is this question coming from? Why should it be up to me whether or not the Japanese people would like to smoke in their restaurants? I do know that the same issue came up when I was a teenager about 10 years ago, and they decided to pass legislation to ban smoking in restaurants and make it so that you can only smoke 20 feet from the entrance. I have to admit that at the time I was a smoker and I was very disgruntled by the fact that they passed this legislation, but I also have to admit that has been pretty easy to get used to this and other smokers I have talked to you have felt the same way. It was kind of a shock to me to hear about how about secondhand smoke is for other people, so once I know about that, I wanted to make sure that I was as conscientious as possible in my smoking habits so that I was not creating a problem for anyone other than myself. One of these days if I'm lucky enough to be strong enough, I will be able to quit smoking, and I feel like that should be the ultimate goal for any individual or for any governmental group.
