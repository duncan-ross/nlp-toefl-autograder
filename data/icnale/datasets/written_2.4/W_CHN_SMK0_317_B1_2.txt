In my eyes, smoking has no advantages but so many disadvantages. But obviously, it is hard enough for people to give it up. Firstly, smoking is very bad for your health especially your heart and lung. At first, you may not feel a bit, but when you are old, you can not stop coughing and you feel tired all the time. Secondly, families and friends around you are badly hurt from your smoking. Many conveys said that smoking have even worse effect on the people around smokers. Thirdly, smoking makes the environment worse and worse. People must live in a dirty world. The air is so bad that more and more lung patients come forth. What is more, smoking won't cost a little so that you save money if you don't smoke. However, smoking can't be entirely forbidden although there are many signs saying No smoking. We everyone should try our best to persuade our parents and friends to give up smoking. And the government should make some more efficient rules to prevent smoking from appearing in the public occasion. As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is how to stop students from smoking because the number of young smokers becomes more. I wish there were no smoking in the world one day.
