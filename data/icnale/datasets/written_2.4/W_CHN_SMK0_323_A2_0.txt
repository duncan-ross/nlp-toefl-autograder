Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather people can smoke at a public place. In my opinion, the answer is certain no. The reasons are as follows. Firstly. Smoking at a public place will make the environment of the public place become dirty, What' more, the cigarette ash have much hazardous substance which will pollute the environment. So, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers. Secondly, at a public place, there are many people who do not smoke. so, if someone smoke at a public place, it will hurt other peoples' body. meanwhile, the strong-smelling of the cigarette is quite terrible to many other people who do not smoke. As we all know, cigarette have a lot of carcinogenic things. Therefore, that the government ban smoking at all public places is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some smokers often say that it takes away some of their freedom. But I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. All in all, people should not smoke at public place, which is no denying.
