Well, I think that it is not important for college students to have a part time job. Because at my college too many reason why we do n ot have a part time job. Many people at my college spend their time to play game online because they think that was interesting, but I do not think so. I do not like game online, I spend my time to practice for laboratory work. I have a bad logics but I try for better than I have. So I wanted to help from my friend. He really have a good logics, he was a clever man. I think many people at my college had a picture that if they had a part time job they have no time for practical work at laboratory or do their home work. Many other reason that make people think that have a part time job is not important. Like we have to done our college after that we'll going to the 'real world'. Or we had too young age to take a part time job at this time. Well, because of that reason I think that is not important to have a part time job. I think I must focus on my studies.
