 Recently, it has been estimated that smokers have made up half of the population in China, and the results also proved that the smokers are becoming younger and younger, even including some middle school students. I was sad and shocked when I heard the news, because I know what it will cause in the future. Smoking is dangerous and harmful to our health, and it could also cause several health problems. One of them is to increase the risk of getting various forms of cancer. Smoking also increases people's heart rate and blood pressure, straining heart and blood vessels. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and a lack of oxygen in the blood which can then lead to amputated limbs and swollen up airways. Many scientists also find that smoking has even more serious effects on teenagers than adults. If the circumstance cannot be changed, the level of Chinese young people will become worse and worse. But there is a question: why do so many young people smoke? Most of them say that they take it as the symbol of maturation. Then I have another question: what is maturation? Is smoking connected with maturation? Li Jiacheng, Bill Gates are both mature and success, but they don't smoke. In my opinion, smoking is actually the symbol of immature, because smokers cannot tell right from wrong. There are also some smokers who say that smoking makes them energetic, but I think the effect is so weak compared to its harms. In other words, it's improper for us to use cigarettes to indicate something. To sum up, no matter who you are, it's improper for you to smoke, for it is equal to slow death. So, now, if you don't smoke, keep the good habit, if you are a smoker, please stay away from it now.
