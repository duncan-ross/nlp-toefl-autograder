 Now more and more college students feel like getting a part-time job, some even being proud of using his or her money owned from part-time job. Others are eager to develop the ability needed in possible future work. Still others who have no clear purpose don't want to be different from the students as a part-time worker, so they join them. It's important for college students to have a part-time job, however, not necessary. Suppose a student, whose family is able to afford the study, is determined to hold the Doctor degree, he should concentrate on the study, paying little attention to something else. Generally speaking, having a part-time job is important. Part-time jobs offer students chances to go out of campus, knowing more about the society and also, provide college students with the plat form to show and develop their ability in a further step. Part-time jobs, to some degree, enable college students to make full use of their time, preventing them from addicting to something else, for example, the online game. In the same time, students can experience the coming life in advance and for most ones, will own the first income. Even themselves can't describe the feeling when they get the small sum of money in common. Part-time job is indeed important for college students.
