In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide without the government's help if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers, but the ultimate issue is choice. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries. When considering the bad effects of smoking, many smokers can't help but to feel trapped because of their addiction to nicotine. Cigarettes are the worst method of getting nicotine into your body. Many bad chemicals such as tar and formaldehyde, and carcinogens, clog your lungs up. Smoking is responsible for a host of respiratory conditions. It damages air passages and can cause emphysema. Cigarettes also worsen conditions such as pneumonia and asthma. Many longtime smokers suffer from chronic cough and excessive phlegm. Our government aims to protect us to save us from society's evils. However, in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking. Banning smoking in all public restaurants violates this principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers.
