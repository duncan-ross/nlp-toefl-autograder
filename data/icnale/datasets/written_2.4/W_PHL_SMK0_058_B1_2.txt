Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country and if possible, in all public places as well. This habit of some people is a threat not only to their health but to the health of the innocents too. We are silently killed little by little because of the secondhand smoke they give to us every now and then that a cigarette or a tobacco is right on their fingertips. What is worse with this is that the innocents suffer even more than the smokers do as studies said. I have heard a story about a boy who had a lung cancer because his father was a smoker. Smoking is considered a violation of human rights in my opinion because these smokers are depriving us to breathe a fresher air. We are already suffering on the pollution brought about by the combustion of fossil fuels from factories and vehicles so why add up by smoking if it can be minimized by not doing it? What might be better is if they will have an area where they can smoke together and not threatening other people. This habit of smoking by others is an annoyance especially when on a restaurant where someone is hoping to eat at peace. These customers go to these establishments to eat and not to get any disease that you brought about by smoking. Everyone should practice proper conduct as always in front of others. If these smokers can't care for their health, at least care for others and also care for the environment.
