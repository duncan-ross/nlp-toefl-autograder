As far as I am concerned, I think that there should be no smoking in restaurants. As everyone knows, smoking does nothing good for our body. It could cause the smokers to get a lot of diseases such as the horrible cancer. Besides, people around the smokers inevitably have to breathe polluted air and have higher risk of getting diseases. Moreover, the odor also destroys others' appetite when eating. Seeing delicious foods in front of us, but we cannot enjoy eating them is a mysterious thing. Therefore, it is important to promote people not to smoke in restaurants. In my opinion, first of all, good regulations are necessary to be made. With definite regulations, people could have the principle to abide by. Secondary, having the knowledge of the bad influences coming from smoking, people also need to have resolution to prevent themselves and encourage others not to smoke in public, especially, in order to have a good atmosphere in restaurants. In current society, everyone has the right to do what he or she want to do, but it should be based on respecting others' right. When in public, we should consider other's right, Therefore, I think it must enforce each restaurant to create no smoking environment..
