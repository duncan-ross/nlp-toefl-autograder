It has been a controversy on smoking in a public place for a long time between smokers and non-smokers. In Korea, smoking is now banned at most public places, such as inside of a building or a restaurant. However, there are still a lot of places, especially, restaurants, have a smoking area for their customers. Smokers say that they have a right on smoking and it should be respected. Yet, I strongly claim that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Korea for several reasons. First, smoking at a restaurant causes the victims by secondhand smoking. While some restaurants have a smoking area separated from non-smoking area, most restaurants have it, but not separated. Consequently, it causes of making the secondhand smoking environment and exert a bad influence upon the health of non-smokers. Restaurant is one of typical public places opens for everyone includes children. To them, secondhand smoking is fatal on their health. If smoker claim for the right of smoking to be respected, the right of non-smokers to breathe fresh air should be guarantee as well. Second, it causes children to have a wrong perception of smoking and be a potential smoker. Childhood is the time to learn anything very fast and get used to what they see. If they are exposed on adults smoking, they would be easily getting used to it. Moreover, they might get a wrong perception think that smoking is cool, so try to smoke in the end. Once children get used to it and fixed on their mind, it is hard to change it. This is why smoker should not insist their right on smoking at a public place. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at the all restaurants in our country because of its bad influence on the health of non-smokers and on children mentally. Smokers do not deserve to threaten the right of non-smokers.
