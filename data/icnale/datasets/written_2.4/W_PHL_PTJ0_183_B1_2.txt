Part time job is being a worker or student for periods that take less time than a full, regular schedule or which an employee does not work full hours. This is an extra source of money or income especially for students. It can be a service crew, assistant, store keeper, helper, tutor, waiter or waitress, vendor, office worker, book keeper, online teacher, etc. Many college students need this because it's hard to be a full time or regular worker while studying your lessons, doing your projects, thesis and assignments in school at the same time. I can relate myself because I 'm a student library assistant in our university and this part time job really helps me and my family in paying tuition fees for my study. Although the money that I will get from the part time job can't cover all my tuition fees and miscellaneous but still it helps a lot. I have two brothers and two sisters that's why I want to help my father and mother through having a part time job. Having a part time job is a big help for every student who don't have enough many to go to school or students that want to have extra income or allowance.
