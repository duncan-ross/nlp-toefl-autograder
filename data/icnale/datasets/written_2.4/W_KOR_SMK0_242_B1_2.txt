I am convinced that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons why I feel this way. First reason for my argument is that second smoking is very harmful to children and the elder. Second reason is that smoking at the restaurants can give displeasure to nonsmokers. First, second smoking is harmful to children and the elder. Of course, smoking is harmful to every person, but children and the elder can get serious health problem. They are weaker than normal adults, so they should be protected from smoking. Specifically, at the restaurant, , even if children respire smoking smoke, moving table is difficulty when they have lunch of dinner, so they cannot avoid second smoking. Therefore, at the restaurant, smoking should be banned for health of children and the elder. Moreover, smoking at the restaurant can give displeasure to nonsmokers. Specifically, smell of smoke is too strong, so this smell can spoil cuisine. Every cuisine has special own smell and taste, so many people eat out for enjoying food's features. However, if someone who sits next seat smokes, this strong smoke pretend others from enjoying cuisine because of mixing smoke and food smell. This rude behavior can degrade other's eating pleasure. For above reasons, I strongly claim that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
