 The question whether college student have a part-time job becomes a hot topic nowadays. Everybody has different opinions. Let's think about what we can get from having a part-time job. Of course we can acquire a lot of experiences and get some extra money to improve our life in college. On the contrary, what do we lose when we have a part-time job? We will lose many time and energy. And it may be influence our study. So I don't think there is a certain answer to the question mentioned above because each student has different situation. To some students whose family lack richness, they may have to have a part-time job to afford their tuition and even help their family to improve life level. It is important to these students who want to have a job after college to have a part-time job in college for they need abundant experience. There are some other students who want to continue studying domestic or go abroad after school. Maybe it is not that much important to them to have a part-time job. For these students, what they should do first is studying well. In a word, college life should be rich and colorful; studying is not the only goal that every student has. We should read more valuable books and learn more skills. If we have more spare time, we can think about having a part-time job. Whatever, we should not waste our precious college life.
