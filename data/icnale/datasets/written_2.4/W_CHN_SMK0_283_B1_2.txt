 Nowadays, there is a trend in the world that more and more people are against smoking in public. However, I disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. No country has completely banned smoking in public, so why at restaurants? Harmful as smoking is, personal habits and the relaxation brought by smoking cannot be neglected. Many smokers consider smoking as a way of releasing stress especially after work. As for those mental laborers, a cigarette may bring them inspirations when they meet with difficult problems. Especially for those who are not smoking, lack of professional knowledge about health keeps them against smoking. Some may argue that the restaurant is a place where many people get together and clear air is required. However, the problem can be easily solved by setting smoking areas for smokers' special need. Some of the current restaurants have already took this measure to satisfy both smokers and other people. Therefore, completely banning smoking is not necessary at all. There is absolutely no need for us to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
