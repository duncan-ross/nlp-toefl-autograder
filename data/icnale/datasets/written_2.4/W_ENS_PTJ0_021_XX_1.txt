I think it is a great idea for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, students should spend the time in college to learn as much they possibly can about as much as they possibly can. This includes both things that they can learn in classes which are related to their majors as well as things that will help them to become better people and also help them for their eventual career after college. Next, many students have the image of being "broke college students" in rather than sit idly by and let the stereotype define them, they can actively pursue a part time position which will make them appear to be more responsible and trustworthy than they would appear if they were simply languishing about. I've had a part-time job at a local pizza shop since I entered college last year and although I sometimes get busy or stressed out with my schoolwork and my part-time job, I still think that I'm doing good things for myself by continuing to work part-time. Lastly, there are also times where I am bored and I don't have a lot of schoolwork to do and it is great to have a part-time job so that I don't kill myself out of boredom.
