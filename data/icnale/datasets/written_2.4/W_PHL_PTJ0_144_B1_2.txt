It is important to have a part time job to college students. They can support financially their studies. Students will know how to manage their time, studying and earning money. They will learn how to prioritize what is important. They will know how to save and spend money properly. Students will gain new experiences and knowledge about working. They could also practice what they have learned from school. They will learn how to cooperate with others and deal with different things in their working environment. If students begin learning to manage a tight schedule in high school, they should soon understand that procrastination might be detrimental to their grade point average. A part-time job makes them block off time each day for work, school and homework. They might also create blocks in their schedule for television watching, sports and recreation. Without a job, their schedules can be significantly unstructured. Part-time jobs help students contribute to their college expenses, which can help you and your family during the economic crisis. Although some of their money should go towards entertainment and recreation, you should still find that their contribution to their spending money is helpful to your budget. Your teens might learn to keep a budget of their own and save 10 to 20 percent of their income each month, which should end up being a significant contribution to their college tuition by the time they graduate high school.
