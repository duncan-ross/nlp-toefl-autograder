Smoking in restaurants should be banned in all the places in the country. When we approach this problem legally, permitting smoking in restaurants is impossible, because smoking in public places is strongly discouraged in the country. As smoking can harm many other innocent people's health, the right of smoking, which can be interpreted as the right of one's pursuit of happiness, is inferior to the right of life of many people. Many institutions related to public health care have announced that smoking not only damage to the smokers themselves, but also to the irrelevant people's skin, lungs, and brains. When we consider that the restaurants are usually filled with so many people, smoking in the public place can be a mass-destruction of health, which should be strongly banned. Also, smoking can be harmful to the environment of the restaurant, which can be very bad for the restaurants themselves. When one smoke, there are many cigarettes, ash, and smoke which should be cleared and refreshed. As a result, restaurants have to spend much more money to deal with the problems. However, as they concentrate on that kind of problems, general service quality would be lowered. For example, when one waiter cleared the smoker's seat, he would touch ashes, and other dirty materials. Hence, he has to wash his hands, which can be other customer's unwanted waiting. As a result, smoking in the restaurants should be prohibited for the people's health and service.
