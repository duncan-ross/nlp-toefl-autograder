I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, they can have good experiences which can never get from working. For example, greeting, keeping on time and having good manners are necessary for all jobs. Part-time jobs let students know these things. Those experiences should serve for their future careers. Moreover, students might be able to find their new characters or interesting affairs which they have never expected. These findings might decide their ways after graduate. Second, they can find that earning is very hard, and they may thank their parents. Third, they can make new relationships with many and various kind of people. When students start a part-time job, they must jump into a new community. At college they often see near ages, but at office or store where they work, they have a many opportunities to be involved with people who can never see at college. However, some say that students who have part-time jobs neglect study, and they should study if they have a time to work. It is sure that it is the part of students to study, but I think students can have a part-time job if they don't reduce their time to study, because they can choose jobs from very different types. Some jobs need only one day work. Thus, I think that it is good for college students to have part-time jobs suitable for themselves.
