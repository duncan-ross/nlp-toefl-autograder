As far as I am concerned, it is not important to take part-time job for college students. And it is just a matter of necessary, but none of important business. Firstly, part-time job doesn't make sure that you can learn something or it can appeal to your major. So we can't say it is important to take part-time job. Secondly, we say it is just a matter of necessary but none of important business because part-time job can just provide money and maybe a little experience. And if you need more money urgently, it is necessary but not important to take part-time job. Thirdly, it goes without saying that our main task is learning as much as possible when we are college students. Except for the classes, sleeping, eating, clubs, and maybe having a girlfriend, we don't have much time for our individual learning. So we cannot spend that amount of time taking part-time job. If we waste much time to do part-time job, our study will have less time to study. That is really a disadvantage of having part-time job. From the above, I personally think it is not important for us to take part-time job. We can make more money if we learn more knowledge now. So we should spend more time studying now than doing part-time job.
