Given the increase in workload and commitment for college students, the question arises as to whether students should take up a part-time job during their free time. While some students may have college scholarships and think that studies should be their priority given the workload that they are facing, I believe that having a part-time job is important as it allows one to be able to gain the necessary work experience and earn money to support themselves through college. With students being more inclined towards academics, more college scholarships are being awarded each year. Students understand that studies should be their priority and given the workload that they are facing, in the form of Co-Curricular Activities and other volunteering activities, taking a part-time job is being seen as of decreased importance. However, even if students may be awarded college scholarships, I believe that the importance of a part-time job should not be neglected. Students need to understand that even if a college degree is obtained, sufficient work experience is equally seen as important to obtain a good job. For example, attaining an accountant job also requires at least 2 years of related work experience. Even more so, for students who do not have scholarships, a part-time job would be necessary for them to support themselves through college, in terms of paying for the necessary school fees and providing for their own daily expenditure without needing to add an extra burden on their parents. This inculcates independence and enables students to be able to appreciate their parents' efforts to educate them and support them all the way till where they are now. In conclusion, because of the reasons stated above, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. (292 words)
