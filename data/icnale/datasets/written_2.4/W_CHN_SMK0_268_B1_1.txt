 Many smokers have a misunderstanding that they are not harming other people's health while they are smoking. Many researches tell us that this kind of thoughts is absolutely wrong. Smokers are harming their own health as well as other person's that around him. If a person is smoking in a restaurant, he is destroying other customer's health. Once I come across with a piece of news, it said that a person that is addicted to smoking has a higher rate of getting cancer than normal people, while people that around the smoker has twice to three times higher rate of getting cancer than the smoker, unbelievable! If there are a lot of smokers in a restaurant, how many non-smokers will get harmed due to these smokers? It must be a large figure. Some smokers might be rich, but if you lose your health, any wealth will be useless. Maybe someone smokes because he is under great pressure, or he is desperate with his life, but those can't be a good reason to destroy other person's health. As we can see, a restaurant is a place which usually has a lot of people in it, so smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country for the sake of people's health.
