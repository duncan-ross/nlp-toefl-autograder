As a college student in grade 2, I think to find some part-time job to do is an excellent choice. And I would like to present two explanations for this. The first reason can be seen by every person. There is no denying that we have been adults, that the reason why we need to shoulder the social responsibility. If we try some job in the free time, not only can we earn some money to reduce our family's burdens, but also the job time in the weekend can enrich our life. At the same time, I think if your weekends have too much spare time, why not choose this meaningful activity instead stay at dormitory and addict to computer games?On the other hand, by the time we do part-time job, it can also give us some experience about the out-side world. When we finish our 4-year study in college, we have to enter to the society in the end. In my opinion, the experience we accumulated during the part-time job will play an important role in future. In conclusion, I think to do some part- time jobs is the best choice for college students. In my class some boy have began to try to do some easy job, like put out ad paper. And I believe there are more and more college students select this way to practice ourselves
