As we all know, more and more college students have a part-time job in their free time. The phenomenon causes intense debate among people. Some people think it not good. Some other people think it is important. I agree with the idea that it is good for college student to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to support my opinion. A part-time job has a lot of advantages. Not only can you make money by doing part-time job, but also improve your particular skill. It can lighten family burden. You can buy thing you like too. Also, you can get a lot of experience about work and communication that are very useful in the future if you find a job. Many students have a part-time job get a lot of experience form it and they find a good job later. However, it also has negative effect on students. Although it can make money and improve abilities, it also takes your much time away so that the time you spent in studying would be less. From my perspective, having a part-time job is a good way for students to improve themselves. But you should get a balance between study and a part-time job.
