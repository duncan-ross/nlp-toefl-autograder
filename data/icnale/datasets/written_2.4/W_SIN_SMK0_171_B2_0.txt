The phenomenon of smoking can arise out of various determinants --- a "legacy" passed down through the family, peer pressure, or simply the social habit of smoking perceived to be cool. Increasing numbers of women are observed to become social smokers to make a statement. I disagree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. I feel that this policy approach can take on a more moderate stance. If the intention behind the policy recommendation is to head towards ensuring a smoke-free country, this can be done incrementally and realistically. While we are clearly aware of the negative externalities smoking causes to the public such as second-hand smoke, policy implementation can make for areas that allow smoking, to achieve the purpose of negating the negative externality while protecting the right of the smoker. It is most unwise to assume that banning smoking at the restaurant nullifies that negative externality because smokers can simply crowd around areas outside the restaurants or similarly populated public areas and remain a public nuisance. If the intention behind the policy recommendation is for the country to eventually attain smoke-free status, it can be done in tandem with other educational measures and dedicated targeted handling of smoking habits. Banning smoking in all restaurants without a moderate stance may instead hurt the food and beverage industry.
