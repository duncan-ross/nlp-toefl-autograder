I excessively approve that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people may think it looks cool to light up the cigarettes and smoke. Some people may smoke because of families and friends. No matter smoke or not, almost everyone knows that smoking can causes cancer, stroke, high blood pressure, heart disease and other fatal diseases which can harm the organs of your health bodies and shorten your life. If there is one person smoking in public area, both smokers and involuntary secondhand smokers around the place get passive effects. Secondhand smokers would lose their comfortable feeling in the bad atmosphere. Besides the smoke is a kind of air pollution to earth. In other words, we also can say that smoking is so expensive that smoker buys the cigarettes by their wealth and health. But it is quite difficult for nicotine-additors to quit smoking. Smoking has already become a part of smokers' daily life. In order to have a smoke-free and better life, I think our government should ban smoking in restaurants but also offer some professional assistances to help those people keep far away from the harmful habit such as cinnamon-flavored toothpicks, chewing guns and healthy snakes.
