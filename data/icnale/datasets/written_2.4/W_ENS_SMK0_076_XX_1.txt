I agree that smoking should be banned all the restaurants in Japan. I recently came back from a study abroad trip in China where I was there for one year. In this time, I saw that many restaurants in China had already banned smoking at restaurants and additionally some of them and made it illegal to smoke at other public places. If you smoke in these public places, you would be given a ticket, and while the fine was not too hefty, it is enough to discourage the average smoker from lighting up in a place where they will get caught. Next, I agree that it is much more healthy for the other people in the restaurants if smoking is banned at the restaurants. It is not right to have to breathe in the secondhand smoke of many smokers around you as the secondhand smoke is much more dangerous than the smoke they are inhaling. Japan and China are similar in many ways even though there are also different in many ways, but I do think that smoking should not be allowed at any restaurants anywhere in the world. It is already 2011, and the fact that smoking is still allowed at many restaurants in the U. S. and apparently at restaurants in Japan is just embarrassing.
