I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is hazard to human's health. Second hand smoking was found to even more hazard, hence, it should be banned at all restaurants in the country so that non- smokers who are dining will not get affected. It also provides a fresher environment for people to have their meals. Smoking was seen as an unhealthy act and should not be promoted. Hence, by banning smoking at restaurants can help stop "promoting smoking" in public places. Children will not be affected too as they will not get influenced by the same thing as adults do when they smoke. However, to smokers, they might find it inconvenient as they may need to go outside the restaurants and smoke if they want. They might found it troublesome and unfair as they also paid to have meals inside the restaurants and they should be allowed to smoke there. They might feel isolated form the majority. As such, restaurants should provide a smoking area that is enclosed so that the smoker can smoke inside the area without affecting other diners. Hence, in the light of things, smoking should be banned in order to take care of non-smoker's interest.
