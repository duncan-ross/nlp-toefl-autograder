I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students can get experiences, money, and be independent. The most important thing is experiences. When college students do a part-time job, they can learn something from anybody and anything. These experiences will be helpful to their ability of think. When they graduate from colleges and find formal jobs to do, they can avoid making mistakes. Money, I guess that many college students have part-time jobs because they need money or more money. They may go shopping with friends, eat food, take a trip, go to the concert and do something they want to do. It is not bad to do a part-time job because of money. But some students are crazy for playing. The crazier their playing, the more money they need. They will not pick the jobs. They probably sale their bodies especially the female students. What a bad concept. I agree that college students have part-time jobs because they need experiences and money. But I disagree college students need part-time jobs because they focus on something bad so crazy that they need more money. They can't get lost again and again and even make their family worried.
