Nowadays, many people realize on the wicked things of smoking, and as we've known that smoking isn't good for everyone. It can cause a risk factor for lung cancer, and heart attack. It also make the smoker has bad personality such as, bad breath, and the people who smell smoke can also be the lung cancer. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking will make other people around the smokers are upset, and couldn't eat. But if the smoker want to smoke, they must go to area for smoking that the restaurant has organized or go to the area that has nobody. Although I know that the smoker will say that they smoke because they are stress or there's nothing to do, I think they should do something that is positive things instead of that. But the best way that the smoker ought to do is they ought to stop smoking. For at least, they will be strong people or they should do for people who love and concern them. So they should think that other-centered not self-centered, and then they may understand the others, and don't smoke again.
