Do you have a part-time job? If your answer is yes, I do. Why you do that? Most reason's student is they want money, to have activity in free time and to find experience. Student want money. They will use money for? Some family, parent don't have enough money for their children. Older child have to help their parent to find money that use in family. They use for education or food. But someone want money for buy something that they want. Student don't want to beg money from their parent so they do a part –time job. Doing a part-time job will help student for find money that use in their life. Some student want to have activity in free time and to find experience. Doing a part-time job teaches them having responsibility, discipline and systematic work. If students have mistake in work, they will get experience from this. Next time, When students have a problem in their life, they can fix it better than a part. From all reason, In my opinion, I thing a part-time job is good for college students. But it's not important for all. For student that want money that use in family, a part-time is important because it make money to them. But student should know a important role in their life is education so they should do a part-time job in free time not all time.
