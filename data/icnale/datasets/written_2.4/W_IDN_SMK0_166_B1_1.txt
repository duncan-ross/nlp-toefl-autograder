In my opinion the government should not ban the smoking in the public places especially in the restaurant. Firstly the cigarette manufacture has a high participation of making high income for the financial of our country, Indonesia. It is not only used for the government but also for fulfilling the needs of all aspects that are faced by the government, like education, housing, governor and many things. It means that decreasing the using of the cigarette will bring to the decrease of income also. And it will make Indonesia will be worst. Restaurant is one of the places that people are used to visiting to when they get bored. So they want to do something that will refresh their brain after having a lot of work activities. Based on research that conducted by one of the doctors, having smoking is able to make the body of the human being healthy. Furthermore, if the restaurant have the route that the visitors should hot smoking there, it will decrease the profit of the owner because the visitors will also decrease. Unemployment is one of the big problems that are faced by the government of Indonesia. When government decides to ban the using of smoking in public places especially in the restaurant, it will decrease the demand of the cigarette. It means that the production of the cigarette will also decreasing and the owner will fire the employment out. So that's why the number of unemployment will be increase. In brief, the government should not ban smoking in the public places especially restaurant because it has many disadvantages not only for the human but also for the government itself because the number of restaurant in Indonesia is very high.
