Many people think doing part time job is an important experience, and I'm no exception. My first part time job was a telephone caller in a cram school. It was an easy and also an uneasy job. When I called someone I didn't know, he or his families would shout at me because they thought I was a liar. But when I called my friends, I could chat with them and it was much easier to invite them to the cram school to listen to the classes. Until I went to the university, I did similar part time jobs in different cram schools. Afterward, I went to Kaohsiung to study English. There were more chances for me to find different part time jobs because Kaohsiung was a big city. In the first year in Kaohsiung, I was a waitress in a restaurant. I gave menus, ordered for customers and cleaned the surrounding everyday. Although it was tiring, I still liked there because the boss and other co-workers were kind. I worked there for 1. 5 years. In the second year, I taught elementary school and junior high school students English in YMCA. Also, I started to be a tutor, too. Teaching students in a class and one on one were quite different, but both of them were fun and challenging to me. From then on, I like to teach students and enjoy the time to get along with them. I think I am lucky since I find out my interest by doing part time jobs. To do part time jobs can make friends and some money, but we still should make sure that we deal with the school work well. After all, to study hard is the basic work for students.
