I do agree this topic because I think teenage is the powerful age. They can do more than they expect and this age can learn fast so it's easy to do many things. I think students should not only study but also learn life through the experience after school by themselves. The value experience is out of class that they should learn because teacher can not give you the real experience. The advantage of doing part-time job, they can earn money by themselves everyone know time is money. I think working for money and experience is the better way than letting time fly for nothing. But it's important to divide suitable time to do everything such as study time, work time, relax time etc. If you spend the time in the wrong way it may impact to your study especially your exam. I think study should come first another is just the way you should learn in your lifestyle. Besides you can get money from your part-time job. You also get useful life skill such as how to work with co-worker, how to manage your emotion, how to make relationship. These experience will make you braver and stronger. And your parents will be proud of you.
