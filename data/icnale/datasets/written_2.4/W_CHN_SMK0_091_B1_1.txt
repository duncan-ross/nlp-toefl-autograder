When it comes to the question of smoking, men will say that smoking is reasonable; however, women think that cigarettes are a bad thing that they don't like at all. As a matter of fact, smoking does harm to people's health, it benefits more harm than good. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For individual smokers, maybe smoking is a hobby that is a part of their life. But we should observe the problem that the harm of the second-hand smoke. Research says that the second-hand smoke is more serious. Restaurant is especially a public place, if you smoke there, you will do harm to not only yourself, but also the others. It is a morality that not smoking in the public places, and it protect the rights of non-smokers. What's more, it eliminates the harm of smoking more or less. However, it calls on both government and individual smokers to achieve the goal. Government should take some measures, for example, to punish a policy to punish people who smoke in the public places. For smokers, they should be conscious of it. Only in this way, can we have a comfortable environment.
