I think smoking should completely ban at all restaurant. First of all, smoking is harmful to the health of the smoker and other people. In the restaurant, it usually a closed area, although nowadays, many restaurant have smoking area, it still have the effect to those non-smoker since the smoke can diffuse to the non-smoking area. Completely ban at all restaurant means there are lesser place for the smoker to smoke, may be it is a good chance for them not to smoke anymore. Second-hand smoke is a problem that being discussed for a long time, smoking not only harms to smoker's health, but also the others. People who inhale the second-hand smoke also cause the serious problem. On the street, this may not causes the serious problem since the area is so large so that the amount inhaled may not be so much. But, in the restaurant, since it usually a closed area, the smoke may trap in the area and people have a larger chance inhale the second-hand smoke, especially those do not have a good air-circulating system. Therefore, I think smoking should completely ban at all restaurant since the smoke, or smoking affect the health of many people.
