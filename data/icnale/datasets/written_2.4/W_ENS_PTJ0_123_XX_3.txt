There is some debate about whether college students should juggle part-time work with their studies. Some would assert that anything less than a 100% focus on one's university studies will decrease learning efficiency and hamper one's ability to be effective in their jobs following graduation. Yet it could be argued that having the experience of working in the "real world" early on might help a student decide on the field of study that is right for them. An engineering student might, for example, find that he really enjoys the sales work he does at the local department store, prompting him to change his major to one more closely connected with business. Or a coffee-shop worker may decide that working with people face to face is much less interesting than ensuring the cafe's internet system is working properly. These experiences are critical for the young individual who will need as many life experiences as possible to decide what career choice will provide them the best fit for their talents and interests. Students who choose to work while they study might also learn to appreciate more fully any financial compensation they may receive from their parents or guardians. Understanding that money is essentially the product of time and energy spent on a given task might make students more carefully consider the decisions they make when it comes to spending any money given them. Indeed, more than any real financial benefit a student might gain from part-time work, a part-time job might give students experience and help them start networks that will benefit them not only while they are in college but in the larger world that awaits them after graduation.
