I've held a part-time job in college since my undergraduate years and I am currently in the last year of my Ph. D. Probably as a result of my own experience, I therefore think that most college student should have a part-time job and there time in college. Surely, it is more appropriate for some students than for others, but the fact of the matter is that at some point, every college student runs low on money and will need to somehow make some in order to keep living and having fun. Also, having a part-time job can allow younger students to mature and become more responsible as well as teaching them how to follow directions and how to work under somebody else's guidance. I feel that students that do not have a part-time job are much less prepared for the careers they will eventually have in the real world than those who do. Lastly, having a part-time job is a great way to meet new friends outside of your of major. Too many of my friends in undergraduate school spend all their time with just one group of people and were not able to experience the wonderful diversity of personalities and backgrounds that one can find in the college setting.
