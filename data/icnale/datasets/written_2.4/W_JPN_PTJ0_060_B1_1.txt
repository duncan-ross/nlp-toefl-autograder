I agree with the statement. Of course, it is the most important thing for college student to study hard and increase their knowledge, but it is also important for them to prepare for living by themselves during the student days. So they should try working and earning money by themselves. If they have a part-time job, they can learn that it is difficult to earn money. Such experience makes them recognize strongly that they have to be independent. When they are college students, they also should have a lot of relationships with various kinds of people, and they can communicate with a lot of people and increase their friends when they do a part time job. This is another reason why I think college students should have a part-time job. Personally, I want to do such a job as teaching the children who want to go to the private junior high schools, because I experienced private junior high schools' entrance examinations, and I think the experience is useful to teach such children. I think that college students should do the jobs which have something to do with what they like or what they are good at, if they can. If people feel happy when they are working, this is wonderful.
