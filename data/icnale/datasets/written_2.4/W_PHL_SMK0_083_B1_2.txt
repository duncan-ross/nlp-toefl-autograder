Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health, a simple reminder yet hard to do. It is also attached in every pack of cigarettes but why people still using it? In restaurants it is very unprofessional if a person will smoke directly through your face inside a prestigious or even a non- prestigious restaurant. What if a professional or well – known man will be at your side and will breathe through your smoke, can see how this guy will react to you? Do you know what it can cause to us? So smoking must be banned in restaurant not only to make ourselves more professional, but will also cause wide range of pollution. Just think of yourself eating food containing ashes and smoke dust, can you even try to taste it? Even though there are ashtrays in restaurants, but still it is very light that it can fly and land directly to your food. So if anyone could possibly do smoking in restaurant, he/she is personally low hygiene. We always want a cleaner place when eating, but if we ourselves cannot force to leave our vices so what's the point of wanting and dreaming a place which is healthier and cleaner? So leaving smoking is also a healthy practice not only in home, restaurants but also in public places.
