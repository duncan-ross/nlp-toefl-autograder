I'd like to see that happen. I mean I do agree with the ban, we have had similar bans in the UK for sometime now. What I am thinking is that Japan has one of the largest populations of smokers in the world. Would the Japanese government consider alienating all those potential voters to introduce a smoking ban in restaurants? If they do, more power to them I say. My understanding is that Japan already has some smoking bans in some areas of Tokyo and other cities so I see that they are taking some steps. A restaurant ban is a huge leap though with so many restaurants strung out across Japan so I wonder how they would be able to monitor the ban. Are they going to train a special restaurant smoking squad to travel throughout Japan and keep an eye on the restaurants? It would need to be a large squad to cover that much land mass. Don't get me wrong, anything is possible so I will adopt a wait and see attitude and hope that it does come about. If it does, then full kudos to the Japanese government and all of those who pushed for this to finally take effect.
