I absolutely hate smoking and I find it very difficult to hang out with smokers. I think that it is quite rude of them to smoke in places where nonsmokers are present, especially restaurants. How are you supposed to enjoy a nice meal when your eyes are watering and your throat is burning from the secondhand smoke? How are you supposed to respect the group of people who don't value their own health highly enough as to make smart choices which can affect the longevity of their existence. If you think about these questions, you will realize that smokers who choose to smoke have forfeited their right to have a valid opinion on the subject. I do agree that they should be able to do whatever they want to do, but I don't think it is fair to nonsmokers to allow them to harm their health. Finally, it is very rude to the restaurant's staff to smoke in the restaurant because the staff has to be around it for hours at a time on every shift. Just from the standpoint of basic human kindness, I think that smoking is a bad thing. I don't know anything about to restaurants in Japan, but I hope that they are not allowing people to smoke.
