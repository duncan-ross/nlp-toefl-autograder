In my opinion, the importance of having part-time job varies among individual college students. However, I believe that most college students have a part-time job is because to earn extra money. It can be extra money for leisure purpose or it can be money to pay school tuition fees. My reason of having a part-time job is as the reason that I mentioned earlier. Hence, I agree that having a part time job is important. Having a part time job will definitely help to shoulder some of the debt responsibility that a college student has to bear after he or she graduates. Having in mind of the future monetary liability that one may have, makes a part time job important. Besides for the reason of earning extra money, I think that the part-time provides each individual a unique experience. It prepares one in some way or another in advancing into the work life when one graduates. It can be the social skill that one learnt in his or her part-time job or the social circle that one manages to create. They are all important skills and experience in life. Furthermore, a part-time job does not hold much risk that one has to face as compared to a real job. This shows the importance for college students to have a part-time job.
