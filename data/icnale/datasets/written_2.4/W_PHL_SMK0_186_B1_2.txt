Smoking is not prohibited specially in the restaurant or public places. there are somepeople who have asthma or weak lungs, so for those people who are smoker should be have their own place where they can smoke anywhere. Smoking should not be allowed in restaurant or any canteens; because there are many diners who are not want the smell of cigarette. Many countries today have laws that prohibit smoking in public places because it affects non smokers as well. This damages their health against their will and could cause them lung cancer. But also it seems as though this law protects only one side and public places, which should be available to everyone foe all purposes, meet only the needs of non-smokers, tobacco causes addiction and active smoker cannot spend a long time without lighting a cigarette which automatically makes public places and many other facilities unsuitable for them and their needs. Smoking could harm not only the user but also those we call second hand smokers these are people who smells it. In fact, study says that people smell it are more likely to suffer worst diseases it more compared to the one using it. So we should avoid this king of vises.
