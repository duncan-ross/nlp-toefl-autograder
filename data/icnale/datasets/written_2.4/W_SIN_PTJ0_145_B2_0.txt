I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I would term a part-time job to include flexible casual event based jobs as well as regular weekly paid activities. The two main benefits of having a part-time job is earning money and learning life skills. I believe that having a part-time job would help a student to be more independent, as he would not depend completely on his parents for allowance money. He would also learn to better appreciate the value of money and how one must put in effort to earn a living. With a part-time job, the student will also learn about responsibility and management of time and activities. He will need to learn to prioritize his time and be diligent in his school work in order to keep up his grades while holding on to a job. However, though it is important and recommended for a college student to have a part-time job for the moulding of character, it is not an absolute must for every student to do so, especially if he is unable to manage both school and his part-time job. In this case he would be biting more off than he can chew and the end result would be disastrous, with the student achieving mediocre results in both aspects of his life. Ultimately a college student must fulfill the basic requirement of completing college. In sum, having a part-time job would be encouraged if circumstances allow, as it would offer a holistic environment for the student to learn life skills that will help him transition better into an adult working life. The student however should be competent enough to juggle both activities and place school as a priority.
