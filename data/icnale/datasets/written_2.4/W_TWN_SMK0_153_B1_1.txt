No doubt, smoking is harmful to the human beings. But there are millions people in Taiwan smoke or ever do it. However, I believe that there are much more people do not like the smell of smoking. So banned smoking at all restaurants is necessary. The rule can protect people who don't smoke away from the harm of smoking. But there are lots of smokers still smoked in restaurants or public area in fact. They show no respect to other people. So how to make them follow the rule is another important topic to discuss. There are two useful ways could make smokers notice that smoking at restaurants or public area could get a punishment and think about whether doing it or not. One is to increase the payment of punishment, and once they broke the rule, the high fee might let them learn a lesson of smoking at restaurants or public area. The other way is to enforce the checking action at restaurants or public area, once someone was found smoking, he or she could get a punishment immediately and even his or her name would be on the black list. In modern society, respecting is a common manner. But in Taiwan, some people still smoke in their working place, restaurant and so on. So I think that there is much more space to increase for Taiwanese.
