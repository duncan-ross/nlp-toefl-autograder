It is very important for college students to have a part time job. A large number of college students, myself included, have their college tuition paid for by their parents and so it is important to learn how to make money on your own so you can learn the value of money and have a little bit of spending money. Also, having a part-time job in college is an easy way to get used to working as everyone will have to find a fulltime job after they graduate. A part-time job can teach you to be responsible, help you make new friends, and help you meet people to network with. Everyone knows it's not what you know but who you know, and so getting started early by finding a part-time job in college is a great way to insure that you'll have some people to talk to after you graduate and are looking for a real job or a real career. I think the most important reason they have a part-time job is so that you can learn the value of money and you can understand how big of a burden your parents have to put you through school. College is expensive, and if you can learn the value of money, you can be well on your way to becoming a successful graduate.
