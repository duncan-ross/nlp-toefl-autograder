Prohibition to people smoking in restaurants is a good thing because the restaurant's atmosphere appealing to people to have more regulation. No smoking in the restaurant is full, because I can see that it is not appropriate if you want to smoke should not really have to smoke outside the restaurant because smoking not only looks good to destroy the environment as well. yourself and the people in the restaurant because it is not slander good restaurant is a place where people come to eat and we get what we want on the business and others who eat the food then I want both taste and atmosphere of the restaurant so will notice that almost every restaurant will have no-smoking which is good if people follow the restaurant atmosphere is clean without pollution, more food tastes good all the time. What attracts people as well. Good pollution free atmosphere to be clean if there is 'no smoking signs' in stores and people to comply strictly. So restaurant must provide 'no smoking signs obviously' easy to see and warn people every time 'this place not allow you to smoke'. It is can help to stop them to smoke in restaurants. May talk about the punishment if they smoke many people need to pay for 2000 baht if they smoke in public place and forbidden place. So must apply and use it.
