Smoking should be banned in all restaurants First I would like to introduce the concept of smoking. The detestable habit of smoking was introduced by America. Now I am going toward my topic which is under my discussion. There are several factors which cause to develop a smoking habit in our innocent society those factors can be a bad company of friends, company of rich people and many more factors. The topic which is under discussion that is smoking should be banned in all restaurants I am in favor of this restriction that if the smoking is banned in all restaurants than May our some people can save himself from such detestable habit for a some time. The origin which gives birth to this bad habit is actually the restaurant where people come for eating or to serving some one; this is the place where the companies are taking origin. It is truly said that first impression is last impression. If the origin of any thing is bad what would be to the next upcoming. That's why there should be banned on smoking in restaurants. So, this social evil can be uprooted from root. In this way we can pure our society from all evils. If we want uproot this social evil from root this is the best way to stop smoking in restaurants because the change is gradually and slowly occurred. If we want to change the society immediately it is impossible, because the change occurred gradually.
