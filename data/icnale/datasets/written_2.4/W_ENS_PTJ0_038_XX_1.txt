One of the best parts about having a part-time job is the fact that by having a part-time job you're setting yourself up for a successful career in the future. For example, if you can find the time to have a part-time job, you might be able to earn some credits toward your major by doing volunteer work or internships at companies that are affiliated with your school or with their major. Furthermore, the more time you spent getting used to work, the better, because after you graduate test will be much all that there is left to do. Most adults in the world spend the majority of their lives working, so by having a part-time job in college, you're setting yourself up for a successful portion for a large part of your life. But also, having a part-time job can help you deal with the tedium of doing the same old thing in every class in every semester. Everyone gets tired of studying, and everyone gets tired of doing homework and taking tests, so it is nice to have another outlet on which to focus your energy for those times when you are feeling particularly studious. All in all, I think having a part-time job is a great way to spend your time in college.
