I am quite assured that getting a part-time job is important for college students. A well-paid part-time job can help solve the financial problem that most college students have. It allows them no longer be economic dependent to parents, and can learn to use the "money of their own" wisely. It could be a first step for a student to learn how to invest, and realize the difficulties of earning money at the same time. Despite the financial topic, part-time job renders college students an opportunity to learn about career and society. After each student graduates from college, he or she might soon face the problem of looking for a nice job. At that time, having a part-time job experience means that they know more about how to find a job. Also their working experiences served as a powerful weapon to beat other competitors who had no such experiences. Besides those considerations of reality, the mental growth is what one can achieve as well. Be more mature and learn to treasure the free time one could have. To know more people, make friends, learn to deal with the world which is very different from school life. Those experiences are rather precious. Besides getting high grades or entering nice university, there are many possibilities in this world. Those are the truths that one can be taught during the procession of working part-time. That's why I think it would be better for each college student to find a part-time job if possible. Even one doesn't have to worry about money; he or she should catch the chance to learn how the working system of this society is and how one can live properly in it.
