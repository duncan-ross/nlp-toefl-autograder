Part time job now plays an important part in college students' life. We can get not only some money but also much experience from part time jobs. So, most of us are willing to do a part time job though it takes much free time. Someone say that part time jobs may lead the college students to a wrong way. They will care too much about money or profits and forget the main task of their college life. Since the students come here to learn, they should concentrate on it. This kind of idea is mostly right. The main task of students is to learn and create. We'd better spend most of our time on it. But experience is good and it doesn't come from books but life. Long time in school makes us far from the society. In order to be more than a bookworm, we should go out from books and do some part time jobs to learn from life. I have to say that more and more students now don't know how to be with others. The main reason is that they hardly spent time with strangers. If they try some part time jobs, this problem will be solved easily.
