I disagree because with all the content and information that students have to take in over a three to four year period, I don't believe it is possible to function at high levels while still working at a job. There have been many cases of students working and graduating I know. However, it is one thing to graduate and what interests me more than anything is how high their scores were. Clearly this is the soul purpose of attending college and therefore, distractions such as having to work at a job are only going to detract from overall performance in my opinion. I am fully conversant with the arguments for and against having a part-time job however, for the reasons mentioned above I stand by my belief that it is not important to have a part-time job while at college. It is far more important to remember the reason students enrol in college which is to learn as much as they can, score as high as they can and graduate. I should also point out that there have been many college drop-outs who were unable to effectively manage having a job and attending college full-time as well. This would seem to support my belief.
