 There is a growing number of people adopting the habit of smoking. However, cigar is bad for us, so it is with the people around. Therefore, in my opinion, smoking should be seriously banned in public places. Smoking cigarettes causes bad air conditions, especially in the sealed spaces, such as restaurants, library, buses and supermarkets. Smoking leads the air conditions much worse where air is not circulated well. Even if there is open enough, people who get close to the smokers will also smell the smokes, unable to breathe the fresh air. If smoking isn't forbidden in the public, more and more people's health are endangered because of second-hand smoking. Smoking can also causes fir disasters. And there are more people in public places, it may cause more deaths and injuries, property loss as well. What's more, smoking in public places gives an example to persuade people to smoke, especially the teenagers. Then more and more people get the bad habit. Finally it becomes a vicious circle and damages the health of society. In a word, it is quite necessary and important to forbid smoking in the public. In order to protect people's health, to prevent the spread of the virus, to advocate the non-smoking and to live a better life, everyone should try their best to forbid public smoking as much as possible.
