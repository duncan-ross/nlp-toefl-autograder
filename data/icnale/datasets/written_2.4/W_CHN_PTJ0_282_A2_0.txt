College is different from high school. We enter the college not only for our further study but also to practice ourselves, experience society for the future and make ourselves ready for entering the society. So some social practice is necessary for us college students, and doing a part time job is a good choice. Part time job can enrich our life in the college. When we are changed from a high school student to a college student, we may find that we have more free than ever. We are not locked in the classroom to review the boring textbook all the day any more. Sometimes we even feel that we have nothing to do after we finish our work. And part time job can kill our empty and make our life more colorful. Part time job can also improve our communication ability. When we take a part time job, we need to communicate with many other people that we don't know before. We need to satisfy our boss and make our workmates feel pleasure when they are working with us. So we have to talk with them often. Gradually we may know how to communicate with others better. Besides, taking a part time job can make us more confident. When we get the money that we gain for our work for the first time, we must feel happy and proud. We recognize that we have the ability to make a life. So we may be more confident. So why not try to find a part time work? And then our college life must be more colorful.
