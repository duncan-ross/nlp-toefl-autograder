Are you one of the people who used to work part-time job? Why do you think to do it? Nowadays, there are a lot of people do it because they have a free time and want money. In my opinion, part-time job is important for college students who lack of money. Because, the university has many activities such as testing quiz, learning subjects, etc. It's necessary to use a lot of money for pay semester fee, university uniforms, cost in department, etc. Especially college students who come from different country, they have to pay more than other students whom live near university. They must rent the room in the apartment, condo, dorm, etc. or live with relative's house in order to go to the university comfortably. Some college students who come back home must pay fee every day. Moreover, cost of living is higher and semester fee is expensive. Part-time job can help them to earn more money. However, college students who work a part-time job will get more skills than other people. Part-time job can help improve their skills in working, habits and communication be better. Therefore, college students ought to do part-time job because it is good for people who want a new experience, new skills to work, earn more money and decrease burden family.
