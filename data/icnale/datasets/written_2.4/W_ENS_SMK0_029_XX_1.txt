The topic of banning smoking in restaurants just came up recently in my own state in Texas. A conclusion has still not been reached, however, I feel that the arguments that were presented from both sides would be similar to the arguments that will be presented from both sides if the same issue comes under discussion in Japan. To summarize things quickly, the nonsmokers feel that it is rude of the smokers to smoke in restaurants because they have to deal with the bad smell and harmful effects upon their health of the cigarette smoke. The smokers feel that the nonsmokers are trying to impose upon their freedom to do anything they want to do, and personally I feel that this is a very serious problem and I would feel very bad if someone tried to tell me what I could or couldn't do. The solution that my state currently uses is to separate restaurants into smoking and nonsmoking sections, and this works to varying degrees of success. Some restaurants have a very good nonsmoking area where you cannot even tell that the restaurant also has a smoking area, but some restaurants have a smoking area that is almost indistinguishable from the non-smoking area. I think that it will take some time to find an even better solution to this situation.
