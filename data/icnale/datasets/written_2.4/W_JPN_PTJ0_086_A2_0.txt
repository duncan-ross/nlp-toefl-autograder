I think it is important for college students a part-time job. Because I pay the lecture money. And my friends come from their countryside and live near our university. They need much money because they are rented an apartment room, cook for them, buy closes and of course enjoy with everyone. So we must make money. But making money is so difficult. Money per an hour job is different. So we must choose a job that can be made much money by short hours. But I think college students must study and challenge. Homework that teachers of college give is very difficult. And it takes us many hours for finishing it. For example challenge of my class needs courage all night. While it also takes us some hours for making money. Even more we should go driving school. Because when we will graduate the university and start working, we will not have times. And if we have a drivers license, we go anywhere by using our car in school days. So we must use time well. And a part-time job is studying sociality. Anytime doing a part-time job will be good for myself. College students need much money, so we must have a part-time job.
