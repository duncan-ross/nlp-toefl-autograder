Smoking is a famous act of the today's generation. They try to tell us that they are the follower of the modernism but actually they are wrong. Smoker use mostly tobacco to entertain themselves. But actually they burn their lives and as well as others. They enjoy smoking to release their depression and think that they are free from them. They are put their life in danger actually. They face lots of diseases, lot of mishappenings happen. Why they do so? Why they act like that? Lack of knowledge? They are misguided by others? What is the reason behind that? I think they have no enough knowledge about that, about their act, and disadvantages. They only start that due to fashion, sometimes want to compete others. Sometimes due to depression. But if they know the disadvantages of smoking they won't do this. But here is a question new generation knows all that think why they act so? Boys thought that girls like them when they smoke? No, never!!! Then why??? The only reason I have come to agreed upon is the materialistic thinking and the no purpose race of looking different and cool which has unconsciously started through different sources.
