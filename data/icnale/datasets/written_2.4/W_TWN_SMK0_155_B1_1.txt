I don not think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Though I hate people smoking, but I know it is hard to stop smoking, they just need it, they can't control. So if we completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, they may feel very bad. We can give them a place to eat with smoke but others can't smell it. So it is up to restaurants how to arrange their place. Lots of people smoking when they was junior high school student, college friends make they smoke or when they are soldier, more and more people start smoking, we can not stop is, so we have to change, find a better way to solve it. I have a lot of friends smoking, they usually smoke. They smoke when they wake up, between classes, after school, after eating, during talking on phone and before they go to bed, seem they can not live without smoking, I hate that, but they just can not stop doing that. So do not just banned it, try to understand them, talk over, and find a better way together. It must be another method we can do. I don't like people smoking, but they have the freedom. Thinking more about them, they deserve it, but sometimes they are poor, too. We can be friend, not to be enemy. Banne it at all the restaurants in the country is not good.
