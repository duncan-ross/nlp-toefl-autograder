Smoking is a habit that is extremely detrimental to health. With each puff that an individual take, it increases the individual's chances of lung cancer. Other than the ill-effects smoking has on the smoker's own health, the surrounding people are also adversely affected. People who breathe in the smoke puffed out by smokers have an even higher risk of contracting diseases such as lung cancer. Very often, the reasons for smoking cited by individuals include a way of relieving stress or succumbing to peer pressure. Moreover, teenagers are more prone to succumb to peer pressure; hence there is an increasing trend of more teenagers picking up smoking. There are several laws in place in Singapore, where certain places like indoor places or covered walkways are designated as no-smoking areas. This is an attempt to curb the steadily increasing numbers of smokers in Singapore. However, I feel that an even more efficient way of controlling the number of smokers could be to alter the prices of each packet of cigarettes such that it dents a hole in the pockets of smokers as well as deter would be smokers away. Another more efficient way could be to introduce stringent enforcement of the current regulations so as to deter people from smoking. Though laws on smoking are currently in place, many people are still smoking because the limited manpower and resources contributes to the inefficient enforcement of such laws.
