Smoking is a habituation for some of people. A part of people say this habituation is bad. In fact the smoker in the world is not a little number. I completely agree with the statement of smoking should be banned in the restaurant, because restaurant is a general place for people. Why should be banned? Smoking make a pollute and make the concentration of air will be dirty by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Both of them and the other concentration included in cigarettes also make our respiratory system will be broken, especially for our lungs. We know that smoking is not only bad for the active smoker, but also for the passive smoker too. We will get in disease in our respiratory system. One of the diseases is cancer. In the restaurant, automatically people need nice services. If the owner let the smoker to smoke their cigarettes there, it will be make the other customers complain. A part of people who have asthma, will disturbed their breathes. In other side, we also have the some negative effects. People who have smoking habituation will be unfreedomly to smoke in this restaurant too and that iss limited their place to smoke's area. It is fine if the other people have different comments and it does not matter if they want to smoke in the restaurant, but it is better if the owner of the restaurant give a special room for the smoker.
