 I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I will list my reasons. First, even though people know smoking is not good for health, many people still can't help smoking. As smoking spread so widely among every level of people, it is nearly impossible to ban smoking in all restaurants. Secondly, we know that smoking too much can cause lung cancer, which can destroy the function of lung completely. But sometimes, smoking seems to be able to lighten the hurt of heart. So it is likely that smoking can be accessible to most people. To me, I think restaurants should be divided into two parts. One part is where people can smoke, while the other part is where people are not allowed to smoke. In this way, most people's needs are met. The people who smoke while having a meal won't trouble other people who hate the smelling of smoking. And smokers can smoke if they like. Imagine all restaurants banning smoking, smokers must smoke outside or just control themselves. Smokers don't like this. Now, as most rich people smoke. Big restaurants don't like this too. So we can do something for the problem but not complete banning.
