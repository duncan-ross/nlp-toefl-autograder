The idea of banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country is impossible and would be very difficult to accomplish. Everybody knows the hazards and the damages that smoking can do to your body but this statement is just realistically impossible. Restaurants can try to ban smoking in their place, however the rate of individuals that smoke in this country is so high that it would be very difficult to completely ban smoking. Some places are able to prohibit smoking, and individuals are able to comply with their rules. However, smoking is something an individual consider routine which makes it hard to completely ban in a country to not be able to smoke in a restaurant. People smoke during meetings, people smoke after they eat, and people smoke to network. Believe it or not, smoking is a very good networking tool that individuals do to increase success in aspects of their lives. Although health is not one of those aspects, people in this country are so accustomed to smoking that the degree of difficulty to ban smoking in restaurants is unachievable. A way to reduce smoking within a restaurant is to maybe open a smoking area with a good exhaust so when one has the need to smoke, they are able to go into the room without disturbing the others beside them. In conclusion, the idea of banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country sounds like an ideal statement that would greatly increase health for others; it is realistically impossible to achieve. That is why I disagree with the statement and suggest that reducing smoking in the restaurants is a more realistic goal that the country should have.
