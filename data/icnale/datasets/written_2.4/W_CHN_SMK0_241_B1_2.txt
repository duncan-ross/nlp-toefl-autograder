Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As for me, I absolutely agree with it firstly because I hate the smell of the smoke very much. And secondly every year, there are many people dying of smoking. However, at the same time there are many teenagers becoming addicted to smoking every year. I think one of the reasons that why there are so many people being addicted to smoking is people's following the examples of each other. So I believe banning of smoking at public places like restaurants can strongly decrease the effect of following each other and prevent more people from the harm of smoking. Thirdly, every year, I see many families dismiss because of their no affording of smoke. It's known that the price of cigarette is high. And once addicted to it, we can't control ourselves. So the expense we spare on it will become more and more. So I think as a responsible man, we shouldn't smoke rather than be banned by strict rules. Last but not least, one's smoking at public places is also a great harm to their surrounding people. It's a kind of behavior that do harm to both. So let's blank the light of the cigarette and become a responsible and healthy man.
