As we all know, smoking is indeed dangerous for our health. Especially to the smoker himself. The chemical in cigarettes which is nicotine inflicts lethal damage to our internal organs, mostly the lungs. The lungs filter the air we breathe, and to this, we breathe smoke whenever we use cigarettes. There are commercials of cigarettes airing on various television networks nowadays. And all of those cigarette commercials have a warning in each end of their advertisement which says that, Cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health, which clearly states that, smoking can kill you> yet, many people still continue to smoke, most commonly in public areas, namely, in streets and restaurants alike. The smoker smoking in public areas is not only inflicting damage to his own lungs, he is also affecting the health of the people around him. This phenomenon is called Second hand smoking. Second hand smoking occurs when people breathe the smoke coming out of a smoker's cigarette. Regarding this case, scientists and experts say that people who unintentionally breathe the smoker's smoke are the ones who are mostly damaged, not the smoker himself. For this reason, smoking should be banned in public areas, especially in restaurants because of the said effect of second hand smoking on the health of the people around the smoker. One of the reasons why smoking should ne banned in restaurants is that, many people especially children dine in restaurants everyday. The children inside the restaurant would be greatly affected by the smoke because most of the restaurants today are ventilated. The tendency is, the smoke would circulate in the whole area because of the air conditioning system of the restaurant. For this reason, smoking should be banned completely in public areas and spaces, especially in restaurants.
