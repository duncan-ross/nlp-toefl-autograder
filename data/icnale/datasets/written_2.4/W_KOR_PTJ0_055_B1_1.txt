I don't agree Topic B. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. What all student have to do is study hard. We pay university tuition at university in order to go university. But university tuition is expensive. Most of the students don't have a lot of money. So many students receive university tuition and living expenses from their parents. If students' parents do not have money for paying university tuition, students don't go university and take a class. Even they cannot see their friends. To go university, many students seek jobs. Or they drop out their university. If students have a part-time job day and night, they can't continue to take a class because they can't spent time in studying. All university students will lead to the world in the future. Many people said that "If students don't have a lot of money for paying university tuition, they can receive scholarship in the university. " But what many students receive scholarship is difficult. Because scholarship is little money than university tuition. We need to remember, a duty of all students is to study hard. So the nation has to support university tuition to students.
