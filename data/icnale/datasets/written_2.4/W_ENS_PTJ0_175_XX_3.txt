I agree. The benefits of having a part-time job in college are just tremendous and now it is a good time for students to start working. I do believe that work is a little harder to come by now with the economy the way it is. It's pretty bad here in NZ but then I guess it is bad enough everywhere. On a positive note though, it's a chance for students to pick up some really useful knowledge and tools and also if they are lucky enough to get something, then they can use that on their resume when they go job-hunting. If they are having problems getting a job then they should look at doing some volunteer type of activities, anything that will fill up space on a blank resume. I do believe that it is important for the kids to stay positive and know that if they want their lives to improve or get the job that they want, they have to stay upbeat and optimistic as well as to keep attacking and be proactive. Companies really look for initiative in young recruits so it's a good time to practice with any skills that they think might be useful.
