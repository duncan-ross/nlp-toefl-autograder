I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Needless to say, there are some benefits for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, they can earn some money to use. Nowadays, being a college student means spending lots of money to buy clothes, books, and other things but his or her allowance is sometimes not enough to meet the needs. Moreover, some students should pay for their own tuition because the tuition is too expensive for their parents to pay. It will be very helpful to have a part-time job as a student for them. Secondly, they can build up their mind for the future. If they want to get a job in future, they can apply for a part-time job related to the field and they will face the reality of the field, not a fantasy. Also, one can be interested in a job after having a part-time job even if he or she didn't heard of a thing about the job. The last and the most important reasons for having a part-time job is that one can experience lots of things which can happen in a society. As a student in a college, he or she probably doesn't know what the society or workplace really is and one can learn this by having a part-time job. For example, he or she can learn how hard one should work to earn money and what ability is required to be successful. These kinds of knowledge cannot be taught in a college efficiently and effectively.
