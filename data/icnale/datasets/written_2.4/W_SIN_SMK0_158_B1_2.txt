These few years, the government has been actively promoting a smoke free campaign. Take for example, frightening photographs of smokers who suffer from diseases are featured on cigarette boxes. Also, they have imposed strict fines on trains and buses if one is caught smoking. This has extended to many places, including restaurants. However, I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers have their own rights too. If they are barred from smoking at restaurants, it will create a lot of inconvenience for them. Indeed, smoking is detrimental to the individual's health. However, we should consider that smokers also require support from people around them in order to quit. This takes time and effort. If we banned smoking completely at all the restaurants, the aim to encourage them to quit may produce negative results. Instead of banning smoking completely, perhaps we can consider the practice of several fast food restaurants such as McDonalds which have allocated smoking corners for smokers to have their meals at. At the same time, volunteers can give out nicotine gums to the smokers and raise awareness of the negative effects of smoking. Eventually, we will be able to create a smoke free environment for everyone.
