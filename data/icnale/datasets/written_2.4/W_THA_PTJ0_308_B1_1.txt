I'm not agreeing with that because it wastes of the time. In college you have a lot work to do. Work with learn it hard but some people can do it, such as my friends. They have to work part time job in the evening to make money but for me I never want to work part time job with learn. But if I can manage time may be I can do it. For some student that work part time job with learn they had hard work because they tired from work and they have to learn sometime they work at midnight it make them don't have enough to sleep, so they for asleep in the classes. It not what the good student should do in classes. For asleep in class room can make teachers up set it not good for student and teachers too. But work part time job and have your own money it a good thing. You can by your own things by your own money it proud. If you work part time job you has to manage your time if you has bad manage your life will get down to the hell. I think work part time job it not necessary because you are a student it not time to work but it time to learn. You has to pay attention about learn not to work. You should use your time to clear your homework more than anything.
