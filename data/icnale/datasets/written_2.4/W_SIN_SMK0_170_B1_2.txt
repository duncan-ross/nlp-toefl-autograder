At first glance, banning smoking at all restaurants seem like a viable step to take. After all, why would a reduction in air pollution and second hand smoke intake for non-smokers be a bad idea? Firstly, it's important to take into consideration that there are smokers who are heavily addicted to smoking. These individuals have to take consistent cigarette breaks to ensure that they do not suffer from the withdrawal symptoms, as theyou've been smoking for many years. Secondly, it would be possible to tweak the system, so as to allow smokers to smoke, while not affecting the rest of the population. There could be smoking rooms in the restaurant, or cordoned off areas located outside the dining area as designated smoking points, permitting the smokers to smoke there. This would resultantly cause minimal disturbance in air quality to the non-smokers, as the harmful second hand smoke would be dissipated before it reaches them. Also, it would give the smokers an avenue to relax and enjoy their cigarettes, after eating. Completely banning smoking straightaway at all restaurants across the country would result in displeasure within the smoking community, from the sudden and drastic change in smoking policies. If it is pertinent to improve air quality conditions by a reduction in smoking habits of the people in the country, it has to be done gradually, easing the policies in, so that the people affected are able to adjust to the new regulations.
