I think a part time job is important for college students occasionally. There are three reasons that I thought. First, a part time job is important for students who independent to their parents such as me! I am living in Nagoya alone. And I have no money. So, I don't afford to buy magazine, comic, etc. and I can't go to shopping, karaoke, and trip with my friends. I think money is important to enjoy college life. Second, I sometimes think a part time job isn't need for us. Because, there are some students who work too hard and don't study hard. We are college students and aren't college fleeter ! So we should study hard in college life. And we should get special careers that we cannot get except for college life! However, there are some careers that we only get at a part time job. This is the third reason. For example, greeting is especially and important skill. Because greeting is needed about business and communication, but many college students including me are not good at greeting. A part time job makes us well about it. That is why I think a part time job is important, but sometimes it is not important.
