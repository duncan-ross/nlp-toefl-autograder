I agree that this is what needs to be done. This is not a case of civil rights, smokers' rights or non-smoker's rights. It is a case of every ones right to life and to live and work in areas that are as conducive to their well being as possible. Having smoke in restaurants, public places or in the workplace, is not conducive to people's well being, not even the smokers. Smoking related illnesses and deaths are completely preventable and this is an irrefutably supported fact that thousands of doctors can attest to. Nobody that I know of, is trying to stick it to smokers, they are just trying to prolong their lives by cleaning up their immediate environments wherever they may be. I believe that most sensible smokers would understand this and would be happy to oblige. I trust that there are a large number of sensible people in Japan who would also see this for what it is and that is that it's not a smokers' vendetta, just a long overdue clean up that need s to take place now without the need for any more bickering or political manoeuvring. This is not a game or an election and it should be given high priority because these deaths are preventable and there is no law that states that people should die needlessly that I am aware of.
