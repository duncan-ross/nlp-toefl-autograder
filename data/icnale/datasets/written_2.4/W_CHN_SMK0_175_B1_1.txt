Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is a serious behavior to smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition. Should smoking be banned at all restaurants in our country? The answer is not so easy, of course. I think we can solve the problem in the restaurant by other way not just completely ban it. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. Although those people have been addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the others' health in public. Moreover, it is common believed that smoking destroy the elegant atmosphere at the restaurant. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. Something must be done in the restaurant to deal with the problem of whether we can smoke in the restaurant. In my opinion, we can set up a public place especially for smokers.
