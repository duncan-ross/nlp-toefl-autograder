My dream is that the police as a kid. I have by becoming a police officer to help all the people I would like to live in peace. So since middle school to go to the police department were studied. I am currently studying at Deleon University Police Department. Especially now, in order to become police officers is a lack of English. So this summer, I'll concentrate on learning English in the idea. Attending the police department during term time to study people with a dream, do you help a lot here? The police, as well as studying to become fitness should be good also. Therefore, the current guidance, such as Aikido and I'm on my way and build up stamina jeokeurodo. Police civil service examination subjects in English, affairs, criminal law, criminal procedure law, there is police science. Among them, I seem the most difficult English. I've learned English since elementary school, but so deep recognition that is difficult. Most people have difficulties with grammar, but I feel a lot harder with English reading comprehension. Do not say a long sentence, especially the more interpretation. Therefore, I am a lot of English sentences, rather than the interpretation it is important to interpret correctly.
