I agree with the statement. Because I hate smoking, I think that it most be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known everyone that smoking is very bad for human health. Because I knew it, I have hated smoker since I have a child. I can't understand their feelings. Of course, there is no smoker in my family and relatives. But, actually, there are some smoker in my friends. One day, they said that if they wanted to give up smoking, but they couldn't. I think it is very horrible that if I want to give up smoking, but I cant. I disagree with that there is a smoker near my around. I want to enjoy having lunch or dinner purely at restaurant. But, there are smoker near my around when I have lunch or dinner at restaurant, I can't enjoy them. If I encounter the situation, I feel some foods very terrible if they are taste very good. So I strongly recommends that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Actually, when I went to a restaurant in Japan, I was very shocked because there are no-smoking seats, but they are filled by other customers.
