Should students do part-time job, because it has innumerable merits? Students, indeed all people, have different needs and desires. Students have the core right to choose how to spend their own time. A financially strapped student, for example, could reduce his/her reliance upon tuition loans. I think it would behoove such a student to therefore work part-time. That said, this same student may offer the following, valid counter-argument: Working part-time, by its very nature, reduces my study time, and puts me at a disadvantage versus my fellow students who do not have a part-time job. Getting high grades is of paramount importance to my future, as I wish to become a doctor. I can tolerate future debt and will have the means to repay it. If I work part-time now, I seriously jeopardize my future. To coin a currently in vogue expression, "I am robbing Peter to pay Paul". Thus, the importance of a part-time job during college rests with the individual student. The onus is therefore upon this student to determine its importance. This choice, as innumerable others, is indeed part of the learning experience.
