As my opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My reasons are as follows. Firstly, restaurants is a public place that has a strict demanding of sanitation. Smoking will produces lots of pollutant that is harmful to people. The smog engendered during the process of smoking contains nicotine and some other chemicals which are the cause of various kinds of cancer. Secondly, while people enjoy their deals, they surely need a fresh and comfortable environment. The smoky smell of the smog produces in the process of smoking will disturbs guests a lot. Especially in the summer, while the majority of restaurants' airconditions are in use, the smell will cause more displeasure due to the less freely flowing of air. Thirdly the stub will largely increase the difficulty of the cleaning of restautants for that stub is easily blow around by wind. What's more, smoking may become the latent danger of fire. If smokers haven't put out the flake of cigarattes thoroughly, then the safety of all the guests couldn't be ensured. Personally I suggest that each restautant can set a smoking room that is seperated from other guests or completely ban smoking, thus provide guests a safe and cozy environment to enjoy their deals.
