In this essay, college students will be defined as full-time students studying in Singapore; this will narrow the scope of our discussion and will hence make for a more fruitful one. As students, participating in a job --- be it part-time or full-time --- will allow for exposure to the workforce. By taking on a job, students learn responsibilities and practical skills. They also are able to reap what they sow and see the fruit of their labour when their efforts result in the form of salaries at the end of the month. Perhaps, students will be able to appreciate more finely the importance of financial management and hence spend their money more wisely. Furthermore, by giving up some of their leisure time for work, students will also learn the importance of time management --- since time is scarcer a commodity now. However, opponents of the argument that students should have part-time jobs put forth the fact that students are indeed, students first. They should harvest their energies on studying and enjoying school instead of going headfirst into the workforce. Should they have spare time, they could spend it on extra-curricular activities or project work. Personally, I feel that having a part-time job is beneficial to students, as it brings about a head start into working life. Despite this, students should place more emphasis on their school work and life.
