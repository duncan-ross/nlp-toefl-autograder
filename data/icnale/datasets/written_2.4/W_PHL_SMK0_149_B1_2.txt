I agree if smoking will be banned completely at all restaurants in the country, because restaurant is a place where we eat together with our family and at that time the children's are there. And restaurant not the proper place for smoking, because some restaurants are not open air the smoke from the cigarette might smell by the other people in the restaurant, we need to consider that the other people there are enjoying with their family, or some people bring their visitors in the restaurant for them to have formal meeting or something important to talked about. As what I said we need to consider some people or the other customers specially children when they saw someone doing something odd they might follow the action also. We all know that smoking is bad for our health it brings a lot of illness to those people who are the one smoking and the others whom are not. The people who are not smoking and got the illness they got it from the so called second hand smoke. I do not know why people still wanted to smoke even if they know the consequences of their action. I do not know if they are not afraid of the illnesses that they will get from smoking. And they are not also thinking of the money that they are spending to buy those things
