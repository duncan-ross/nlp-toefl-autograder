Smoking should definitely be banned at restaurants. Several countries in the world such as Italy and Ireland have already banned smoking on a nationwide basis, and I feel that this sends a good message about their country to the world. The message is that their government cares about the health of their people, and they care about the health of nonsmokers. Continuing to allow smoking in public places like restaurants only shows a backwards thinking and otherwise primitive culture in that country, and I don't feel that this is consistent with Japan's goals as a world leader and the third largest economy in the world. With such a large economy, it is easy to offset the negative affects that a smoking ban in restaurants may have, and also, a smoking ban in restaurants may have the unexpected affect that business will increase as a result of the increase in customers who now feel comfortable eating out at the restaurants. Next, no one should have to see a family or friend go through a terrible period of hospitalization and a prolonged and miserable last few years. Children should be able to watch their parents grow old, just as their parents would like to watch the children grow old with them.
