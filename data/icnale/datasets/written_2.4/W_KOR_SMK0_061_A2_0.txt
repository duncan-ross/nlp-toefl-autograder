The reason is Smoking is harmful to health as well as gives discomfort to others Growing number of smokers who went on that day, but also the growing trend is non-smoking areas. But most of all in the dining room I think smoking should be made to the essential. Everyone in the restaurant a taste of their food hangaropgo feel comfortable place to enjoy the time. Places to eat such food if the puffing can give offensive to another table. As experience in the restaurant when I went to the defendant tobacco yeopteyibeulyina yeopsaramyi once or twice, if ever it was not unpleasant. So the father smoking in public places also needs to ban smoking. Also, common sense would know that most people own second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoking. For this reason, public place if the puffing stamp in the dining room to the greater glory than his others, it is also damaging. The restaurant is clean, the place where prevail if the puffing of people such a bad place to think. The entire restaurant, so I think smoking should be set.
