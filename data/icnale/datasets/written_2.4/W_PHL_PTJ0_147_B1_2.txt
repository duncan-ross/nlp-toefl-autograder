Last year, I joined and started to work as a distributor of Royale Business Club International Incorporated, part time. Though I didn't do it full time, I didn't get to earn much as my friends who had lots of free time to do so. Still, I manage to help myself financially in terms of extra allowance for a month. It's a really big help financially even though you just do it part time. For me, I think getting a part time job is extremely important so that you can help yourself financially in times of need. Even though it's a necessity, extra income can come in handy. You'll never know when your salary or monthly allowance will eventually run out. As a student, I have a very hard time with my budget monthly. There are days when you just have to spend for something that you feel the need for. I 'm not saying that you should spend your hard worked money just on yourself. With this money you can always help someone in need, like someone in the corner of the street who needs a bit of help financially or is starving to death. So far I have donated 2000 of my total income to charity and outreach programs held on places in the Philippines who have suffered from great calamities. Those who need to have their homes reconstructed, those who need food, water and clothing. 2000 pesos maybe little to serve the cause, but take note that something like that only comes from 1 person, who happens to be a student. After learning the vision and mission of our business, I, therefore conclude that having a part time job is extremely important for each and everyone.
