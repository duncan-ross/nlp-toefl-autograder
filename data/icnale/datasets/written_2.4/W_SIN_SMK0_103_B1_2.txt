Tweaked slightly, we would probably be better served ruminating upon the question "Smoking should be completely banned IN all the restaurants in the country" rather than AT all the restaurants in the country, simply because in implies inside the restaurant, which is the issue we are presumably concerned with rather than if we were to read the original question which uses the preposition "at" which would leave us reflecting about the problem of smokers in the vicinity of the restaurant. It is probably fair to say that, with the exception of some very stubborn scientists who contend that there is no direct correlation between smoking and lung cancer, smoking is bad for you. Extended further, it is probably also fair to say that smoking is not only bad for you, it is bad for the people around you. This is the idea that is troubling. If one were to negatively affect oneself through one's actions, it would not be so much of a problem. However, when one negatively affects others through one's actions, then we are forced to consider the notion of social responsibility and how much of it we have to take for our actions. I believe smokers should bear the full extent of their actions and therefore it would be fair to completely ban smoking in all restaurants and public spaces in the country. In addition, all smokers would have to smoke in dedicated confined spaces so that the only people harmed by the smoke are other smokers themselves.
