There is a general debate nowadays about the positive and negative influence of smoking in public place. Of course, people's perspectives diverge considerably. As for me, I am inclined to the view that one shouldn't smoke in the public. Among countless factors which contribute to my position are the following conspicuous ones. First of all, smoking by itself can pose a probably and potential threat on one's health and smoking in public place not only be bad for smoker's health, but also adversely affect other people's health. According to a survey published on SCIENCE, the second smokers, breathing the smoke indirectly, suffer the higher risks than the smokers Furthermore, smoking in the public will definitely undermine the interpersonal ship, and it can probably lead to other's resentment. Secondly, smoking in the public will increase the risk of fire hazard. Most of the smoker invariably ignore to extinguish the cigar, throwing the alight stub without caution. When the stub contacts some inflammable substance, it can probably lead to a fire hazard. This can be aptly exemplified and illustrated by the case of a fire accident in CHANGSHANG PARK. A man who forgot to put out his cigar thrown it casually, but it was out of his imagination that this behavior brought about a big fire in this park, and as a consequence, various trees disappeared in this accident and the loss can not be estimated. All in all, the disadvantage of smoking in the public overshadowed the advantage of it. so I reinforce my standpoint that smoking in the public shouldn't be allowed.
