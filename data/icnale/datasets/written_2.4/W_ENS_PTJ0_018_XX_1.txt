I have had a part-time job only in the last semester of college. I have been working at the recreation center weight room, where I keep everything clean and help people who need help. This work study job is really great because I am allowed to study when the weight room is not busy, and this allows me to keep up with my schoolwork while I make a little bit of spending money. Even though this job is not related to my psychology major, I feel that having worked in a real situation can help me to gain some of the experience I will need to be successful after graduation. Also, I have made many new friends by working here, and I hope that I can make many more in the future as well. It is a great feeling to encounter people on campus who you have met through your work and it is a great feeling when someone recognizes you. The sense of community and togetherness that comes from working in any organization is also very important. As the saying goes, no man is an island, and having a part-time job is kind of like having a bridge back to the mainland. Based on my own experience, I therefore think it is safe to say that is important for college students to have a part-time job.
