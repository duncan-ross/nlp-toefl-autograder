However, different people have different opinions. As we all know, it is bad for ours health to smoke. So many people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As a coin has two sides, smoking not only is harmful for our health but smoking little also makes people excited. If you are addicted to smoking, it is difficult to rid out of smoking. We should persuade them to smoke as little as, but not request them ban smoking. Besides, it has become traditional to give one cigarette to another at table in restaurants. So I think smoking should be banned in some restaurants where women and children would be but not all. In one word, I think Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People should learn when smoking is proper.
