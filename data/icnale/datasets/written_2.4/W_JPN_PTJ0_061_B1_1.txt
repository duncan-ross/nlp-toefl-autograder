I agree with that. There are two reasons to agree that. The first reasons is that college students need to learn social systems I think. College students' job is studying. On the other hand we are also post-working adults. To working part-time job we can get many knowledge and we are still students we can have much experience of various sort of job. When we select our job, we can refer to that experience. As a result we can have job that is good for us and suit us. The second reason is that we need money in all sorts of ways. For example, join club activities, to go shopping, to play with friends, to buy many stationary and so on. We can have a good time every day only after we earn money ourselves because that money are made by our sweat and effort. At the end of that we thanks to our parents and we can be aware of the importance of the money. In conclusion, college students should have a part-time job. If we don't have job and grow up, we become immoral adult who don't know important thing I think. Our study conclude working so being consistent is important.
