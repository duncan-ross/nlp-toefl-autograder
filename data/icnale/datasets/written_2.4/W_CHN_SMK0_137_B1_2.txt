I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in public, especially in the restaurants is a universal thing. But, many people regard it as a impolite behavior. I greatly agree with this idea. My view of it as follows. Firstly, restaurants are the public occasions, so, there are many different people in there. Like: baby, little children, women, the old and so on. This group of people cannot bear the smoke. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants is not good for other people's health. The root may drop in the plates because of your carelessness, when you are smoking. Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants is an unhealthy behavior. It is bad for your health, especially when you are eating something. For other people around you, they are smoking the secondhand cigarettes. It is much bad for health than you. Last, I think that smokers damaged environment in the restaurants. They upset people who are having dinner. If you really cannot help smoking, please go to the washing-room or the room just builds for those smokers. Those are my opinions about it. I hope one day, less and less people smoke in the restaurants. Let's have a good environment and good mood to have dinners with families or friends. On the one hand, it's good for your health. On the other hand, it is good public.
