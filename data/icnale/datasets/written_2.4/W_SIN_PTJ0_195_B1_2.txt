In Singapore, college education typically comes after a long break for both genders---males do it after national service (conscription), and females have an eight-month break in between graduation from junior college and matriculation. During this period, individuals mature and are expected to become more independent. Speaking from the perspective of a female, a part time job as a college student is important because at 21 years of age, I feel awkward having to ask my parents for money for everyday purchases like toiletries and fashion items. It is probably due to my Chinese upbringing that I do not wish to burden my parents when I can gather sources of money myself. Other than being able to fund purchases, part time jobs also prepare college students for the work life that comes after. They learn multitasking, balancing studies and work while striving to perform at both. They are also given a glimpse of office politics, depending on the environment they work in. The amount of income they receive also allow them to experiment with financial planning before they step into work life where financial mistakes may cause graver consequences. However, not all college students may find working in addition to studying the most suitable way of life, especially if there are other existing commitments like co-curricular activites. Take me for example, other than being a student and a varsity cheerleader, I hold two part-time jobs. This arrangement works for me, but my friends have been worried about my ability to cope and cannot imagine themselves in my shoes.
