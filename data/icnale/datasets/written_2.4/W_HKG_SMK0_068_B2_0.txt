Smoking is a long-term problem until now. Have you ever smell the smoke? If yes, you may find that the smell is terrible and smelly. I will state that why smoking should be banned fully and how terrible of the habit of smoking is. Smoking can caused many diseases such as cancer, heart problems, and lung diseases. We are even informed that cigarette smoking may gravely jeopardize not only the smokers, but also the non-smokers. So I totally agree smoke ban. Also, smoking completely ban at all restaurants can help some people who are not smoking that can not to smell the smoke. It is fair all people. If the people want to smoke, they can go out and smoke that not to affect the others. In addition, smoking completely ban at all restaurants can also build a health image of Hong Kong. Maybe this can attract more people visit Hong Kong. To conclude, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned and we should report the offenders to the government to eradicate the bad habbits of smoking.
