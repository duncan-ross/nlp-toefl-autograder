I think smoking is necessary to completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, all of us don't want to die because of lung cancer. Smoking is a fatal cause to lung cancer. There're 87% people suffering from lung cancer owing to smoking. The cigarette contains a lot of damage factors that makes the smokers' lung be filled with cell of cancer. Second, that smoke will flow to lung and the air with smoker's blowing and inhaling. Consequently, the smoke into the air will be inhaled by someone who is eating. It's unfair to other people without smoking. The restaurant is often airtight so it will make much chance of inhaling. According to the study shows that people will have much opportunity to get lung cancer with second-hand smoke. They care more about their health than smokers. Why they have to take a chance to get lung cancer when they just have a meal. Third, people don't be willing to go to the restaurant where doesn't completely ban smoking so it will have bad income. And if it is not completely banned, it will happen a lot of argument between smokers and non-smokers. The boss of restaurant will be in a dilemma. So why don't completely banned smoking?
