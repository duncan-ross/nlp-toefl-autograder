Smoking is one of bad habits of humans. It causes many of diseases. And makes bad personality. But it's rooted in every society since former times such as Indian smoked to proof their brotherhoods. In nowadays you still see many people smoking in public places such as university, park, mall, on footpath, even in restaurant. So should it be ban? It's hard to say. But in my opinion some places should be not allow for smoking. In this case, smoking in the restaurants should be ban. Because of the restaurant is place that people come to eat happily not to come and sniff cigarette's smoke. They should come to eat nutrients not diseases. As I told at first smoking cause bad personality and disease such as lunge cancer or bad breath. But all of permission to allow or not allow for smoking is upon to each restaurant. If they give the permission to not allow to smoke in their restaurant may be they lose their smoker customers. But if they allow to smoke in their restaurant may be they lose other non-smoker customers. It's all about profits. Even though, we can't order the restaurants or people who smoke to not smoke in the public places. But we can zoning for smoking areas. Or teach our children for bad of smoking. And we can raise them to be adults who don't smoke.
