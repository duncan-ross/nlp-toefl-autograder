Our great leader and founder of Pakistan QUAID ?E-AZAM said that Students are the back bone for our country Our country Pakistan is not very good in economic. People have not enough money to study their children's. So they don't to cause to go their children's in schools and collage. In our country the percentage of poorness is above 75%. Peoples have not enough money to cause to go their children in collages. They cannot afford the expenses of study. Those children who want to learn they do part time jobs at some places and afford the expenses of their studies. So the part time job is necessary for collage students. Due to doing jobs their confidence level is also increase which is very good for them. They have much power, confidence and strength to solve the problems. They can face any difficulties of their life. But for the collage students the jobs are those in which they don't work hard. If their jobs are tough than they do not take a proper time to their studies, which is very dangerous for them. Jobs are easy and cannot take a lot time of them. In this way they don't take a proper time to their studies. In some cases, parents of the students pressurize their child to earn money to support their family and they became a heddle in the way of their child. Parents do not pressurize their children's to earn money if they want to learn? Now our government has free the education up to metric level and provides the scholarship to girls. Now education became free up to metric level. They also provide books to students. So students can easily get education up to metric level. Part time jobs are done, when they are in collage and they don't afford the expenses of education. So part time job is necessary for students.
