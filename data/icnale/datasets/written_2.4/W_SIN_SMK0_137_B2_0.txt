I disagree to the statement given in Topic B. A complete ban is an extreme measure against smokers and is hence, uncalled for. While smoking is a harmful activity that affects the health of smokers and the public who inhale the second-hand smoke, a complete ban to smoke in restaurants deprives the freedom of smokers completely. This is exacerbated by the fact that nicotine present in cigarettes makes it hard for smokers to kick the habit and hence they are inclined to smoke every few hours and even before or after meals. Therefore, a complete ban may spark fury amongst smokers due to the strict restrictions placed upon them. Additionally, while smoking is largely perceived as an unhealthy habit, smokers may argue that it is a form of activity that helps them to de-stress and a complete ban to smoke in restaurants is discriminatory. Furthermore, a complete ban on smoking could adversely affect the sales of cigarettes and thus affect some businesses negatively. Alternative measures should be introduced instead of applying a complete ban on smoking throughout the country. For example, depending on the design and location of the restaurant, partial smoking bans could be implemented instead. For instance, restaurants with outdoor and indoor dining areas can segregate their dining areas such that smoking is only permitted outdoors. This allows smokers to smoke freely outdoors while protecting the health of customers who prefer to dine indoors. Such a measure involving partial ban of smoking practices has already been implemented in Singapore. Therefore, the above arguments demonstrate that a complete ban of smoking practices in restaurants is not an ideal policy.
