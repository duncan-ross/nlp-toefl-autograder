I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays people smoking in everywhere. It can harm themselves and people around. In restaurant should have a sign that ban people who smoke or fine them. The government should play a hard role to punish people who break the rules. And the government should show them how much smoking harm themselves and how much money you have to spend for smoke. The government should restrict some area for smoking only. And fine anyone who breaks the rules. In restaurants, the public places for everyone who wants to eat out or for gather members of their family. It should be a happy time when members in family have dinner together. But it can be an unpleasure time when it have an unwanted smell in restaurant. In public places, should have some area for smoke only and fine them who break the rules. Smoking has many disadvantages not only the smoker but also family member and other around. Smoking causes lung-cancer and other disease. Smoking should be banned permanently. If you addicted to smoke, you should force yourself to stop it. The government should help those who want to quit from smoke addicted. So, smoking should be banned in every public area.
