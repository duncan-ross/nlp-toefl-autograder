If smoking is still allowed at the restaurants in Japan, I think it would be better if it is banned sooner rather than later. Many places in the world and in the United States have already banned smoking in restaurants, and I think this is common sense because restaurants are supposed to be public places where anyone can go and enjoy themselves comfortably without having to worry about whether or not their health will be affected. Especially in the U. S., most of the food is already so bad for you that having the extra affect if smoking is almost just like slapping yourself in the face. Nonetheless, many bars continue to allow smoking, and I feel that this is more appropriate because bars are supposed to be places for adults primarily. This does not make it any more pleasant to be in a bar if you are a nonsmoker, but you have to realize that there are many adults there who have many ideas and different lifestyles. A good first step in this situation might be to just banned smoking at the family restaurants in Japan and leave it legal at the bars and other adult opinions.
