Smoking has been causing serious issues in the modern society. Researchers have proven that smoking cigarettes may cause several diseases including lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases and etc. Cigarette smokes not only affect the smokers, but also can even more seriously affect people next to smokers. Therefore, may countries have legislated to completely ban smoking in public areas such as in bus stops, play grounds and etc. However, it would be also necessary to ban smoking completely at all restaurants. Most of restaurants are located inside buildings. Even though a restaurant has a great air ventilation system, it would be really hard to completely ventilate circulate cigarette smoke with fresh airs. Therefore, even if a few of smokers smoke cigarettes, everyone in the restaurant should inhale smoke that contains thousands of toxic chemicals that can cause cancers. Even if it is a relatively short period of time to be exposed in those chemicals for non-smokers, there is no reason why non-smokers should be in the restaurant with toxic smoke at the first time. Smoking is hazardous to one's health has become a common sense to many people who have watched and read anti-smoking advertisement and researches. However, some people still would smoke in a public place without consideration of others. A restaurant should also be treated as a public place since it is a place for everyone who paid for their meals. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
