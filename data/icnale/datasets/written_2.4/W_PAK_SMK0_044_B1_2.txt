Some say smoking is a bad habit. I say it is only the preseption standard of good and bad only shone as what we have striven to overcome. Handworkers are also smokers, nickotene keeps a man concentrated. I myself cannot a smoker, yet I am not deadly against it. When people say smoking should be banned at all public places. It is harmful for our health but people do not want a temptation around them. We should give people liberty to choose whatever they want to. We should be strong and should have enough in us to resist temptation. In a way we would be tempting the temporer. In conjested places smoking should be banned and smoker's themselfe should have awareness. So they do not cross the boundries of patients of the peoples. If restaurant is not often air restaurant then smoking should be banned or if there are too much smokers visiting the place then aware of particular place take necessary steps to facilitate those people. If restaurant is open air restaurant then and there is enough space to breathe without nicotine, then smokers must do their job because there is no harm in it. basic thing is not ban but awareness. To create a system where people are aware of their rights and have liberty to choose. Banned places means dictation and a steps towards and of liberty. So anyone responsible for smoking decision, must think twice when are take a steps.
