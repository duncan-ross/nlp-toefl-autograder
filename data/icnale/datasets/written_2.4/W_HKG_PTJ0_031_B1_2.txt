There are two main kinds of university students. They are categorized by their economic situation, that is the income of their family. The first type will be rich students. What rich means here is that they have sufficient money to pay the fee. And for these students to have a part-time job is not important at all. The second type is the poor ones. Their family income is not enough for them to pay the fee even with the support of government grant. So part-time jobs will be vital to them. To conclude, part-time jobs are not important for most of the university students except those are in need. Part-time job(except private tutorial) by nature is not for learning, it is for earning money. Most part-time jobs undergradate students can do are labour work. If the purpose of the 3-year studying in university is to learn in every aspect, part-time jobs will be a waste of time. These part-time jobs require employees a lot of time. Some of them like some friends of mine have to work overnight. Given large amount of energy to work, they can hardly concentrate on study for most of the cases or just lose the euthisasism to learn. If they have to learn things like financial knowledge, communication with others or things outside classes, part-time job is enough but not necessary. University is already a good platform for students to achieve what they want. There are abundant resources for students to learn like the society, club or the events organised by school, department or faculty. It is not a good choice to have part-time jobs with the risk of losing passions to learn and waste the precious resources provided by the University. And time is precious as the University life sustains for three limited years.
