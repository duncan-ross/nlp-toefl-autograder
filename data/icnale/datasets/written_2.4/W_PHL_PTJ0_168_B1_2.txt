College is considered by many as the training ground that prepares students for work. Most of the basic skills needed for any field of work may be acquired in college. This is attainable by engaging in different types of academic activity – be it in the form of lecture or actual application. Both types of learning are vital to one's wholistic development, thus, having trainings in both aspects are usually included in the syllabi of universities. In line with this, the question of students having part-time jobs arises. Although it is highly recommended that students have an expertise on their field of work, I think that it is not necessary for one to be employed in a temporary basis. This is due to the fact that students have an obligation to study, and having a part-time job may interfere with their time to review. It wouldn't be a loss for students, as well, to not engage in temporary employment as most universities require OJT or On-the-Job Training for students who are about to graduate. The involvement of this program in a university's curriculum allows a student to learn and develop their skills in their line of work without having to compromise for study time. If the main concern of the given statement is the acquisition of skills needed for work, then it is not necessary for college students to have part-time jobs, provided that the university they are enrolled into has programs which allows them to simulate or participate in a work environment.
