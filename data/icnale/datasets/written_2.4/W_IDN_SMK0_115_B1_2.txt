We know that smoking is always banned in all of the place actually. Why? Because it has many bad risks for all of the aspects of our life, even though in the restaurant area in this country. And I think it is done properly. Restaurant is a place where the people want to enjoy their meals with their family, brother or sister, friends, etc. without some interruptions, just like there are much smokes in their room. Because in the restaurant it self there are many people, not only the people who like smoking. Furthermore, we can see what the bad risks of smoking are. For the passive smoker or called secondhand smoke (SHS) has the same bad risks as the directly smoker, that are lung cancer, heart attack because it interrupts the circulatory system, fetus interruption, and etc. So we can imagine it, it will very interrupt if it is done in the restaurant area. The visitors restaurant could not enjoy their meals for their healthy because they smoke passively from the directly smoker, even one people. So for the restaurant managements have to make some regulations for this thing. For example, they can make a poster which written "No Smoking", or prepare a smoking room for the directly smokers. Because it will give many more bad effects for the healthy than the advantages.
