Part time Job is quite fun to be engaged in. Most of the students, love to do work after or before they class because they have to earn money for their studies. Through part time job they get their money that would fill in their needs, wants and experiences. It is important for someone to have a working experiences because it's a sign of independency and it can actually lead us to become a mature and skilful person. But before applying for a Part time Job we have to consider some stuff. First, do we really have to get a part time job? Second, How much money I can make for this job? Is it really worth it? Third, do I really have enough time to accomplish this job? and Fourth, Am I ready for this? Those are the things you have to consider before getting a part time job. If you can't get a part time job because you think you're not that ready but you still have to support your studies, you can actually have a side lines. Side lines like Tutoring other students in Math, English or Science (whatever is your specialty), Baby sitting you neighbour's kids, Doing School Projects, Typing Jobs etc.
