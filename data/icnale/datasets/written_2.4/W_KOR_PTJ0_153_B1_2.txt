These days, many college students have a part-time job. Around me, my friends work part-time job that they want to do. I think that the students do a part-time job. Why they have to do part-time job? I can explain two reasons. Firstly, it is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among them. My friend, Seri, was afraid of contacting with strangers. So, I worried about her personality. I advise her to do part-time jobs to acquire experiences from frequent contact with unfamiliar people. She sought for a part-time and finally got it. As she worked it, she became more and more lightened and furthermore she was independent. Secondly, part-time jobs can make the student's lives more colorful and is good for their personal development. In my case, I did part-time jobs last summer vacation to go travel to a foreign land. So, I worked hardly to gratify my dream. In the end, I earned enough money to go abroad. So, I traveled to a country. In that place, I met various people, got along with them, and experienced their culture shock. Through its experience, I think a little more mature. So, I agree that students have part-time jobs.
