Part time job is form of employment that works hours per week or month. There are many sort of work. For example, serve in restaurant, tutor students, work in cafe and so forth. Trough part time job, you experience new thing and job that want to work. You can experience that can't feel at school. Also you can make money yourself as an allowance or school expenses. Many university students do part time job for their tuition fees. I worked in pizzamaru 1 year ago. I worked 11 hours on weekends. I made pizza and worked in counter. I had to stand all day. Making pizza was difficult to me. I worked in cafe. I took an order and made coffee. It was easier than pizzamaru. I also worked in Amor pacific. In here, I packaged the products like shampoo, toothpaste and cosmetics and so on. I worked in 8 hours a day. I stood all day and took a break 15 minutes every 3 hours. I was really tired. I felt that making money is very hard and doing service industry is very stressful. I think part time job is should try for your experience. You have to experience more than once.
