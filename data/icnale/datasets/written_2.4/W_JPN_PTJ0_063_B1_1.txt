I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. The first one is the fact that I learned very important things from my part-time job. They are the worth of money and that to earn money is very hard thing. Without earning money by myself, I think I never really understand them. And more, without understand them, I will forget to thanks for parents that they have used very big money for me from when I was boned. The second is trough the part-time job, we can meet adults who is not parents or teachers. They think we as people not children but adult who are same they. It is important for college students to understand that they are a member of the society by working. Finally, I think we must help parents by having a part-time job. The money costs for school is very expensive, and more, we need money for playing with friends, joining some clubs or circles, and any other tings for have good college life. If children do not have part-time jobs, parents need more money for children. We should make money which use for our fan. Because of these reasons, I think college students should have part-time jobs1
