Part time job is quite being a trending topic nowadays for college students. With the promises of early wealth and bright career future, in my opinion: part time job is as is good as it looks. It gives you whole future career references and an addition for your pocket money and it opens the doors of opportunity larger after you actually graduated. I did not say that part time job is perfect – it is just how the students would do it. Part time job is a clear phrase, it is part time. College students who have a part time job must remember that they are a full time student, and the part time job must not interfere with their college life. While their part time vacancy filled with those younger generations, they will have better quality to compete for those better jobs with those who recently graduated from the college without any job experiences. At the end, I would suggest every college students to take a part time job since it is beneficial, and it will brings a whole new experiences and tons of new friends, not mentioning a promise full time job in some companies for those who worked well and graduated from the college with remarkable marks.
