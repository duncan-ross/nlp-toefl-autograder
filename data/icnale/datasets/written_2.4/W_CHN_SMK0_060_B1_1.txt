Everyone knows that smoking is harmful for our health. Every year, the number of people who are addicted to smoking increases sharply. Should smoking be totally banned in some public places, such as restaurants? For me, I think it is not a good idea to ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons. Each person has their own habit. I don't think it is suitable for government to interfere citizen's choice. What should our government do is helping build a particular place for people who are addicted to smoking in public places, for instance, setting a suitable space in a restaurant for people to smoke. By doing liking these, other people who don't smoke also won't be influenced. Smoking won't be banned, if people who are enjoying their meals in a restaurant are forced to stop smoking, the development of some restaurants also will be influenced. So just think the most suitable way to solve these complex problems and provide people with their own space to enjoy themselves. We can come to the conclusion, for the development of restaurants and for people's right, we should divide restaurants into different parts. Smokers can smoke in the smoking place. The others can have meals in not smoking place and not get influenced.
