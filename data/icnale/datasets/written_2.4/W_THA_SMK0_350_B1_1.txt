I think banned people who smoke in the restaurants, it is the most important thing to do in any country. Because the restaurant as the place that people want to eat food and they want the restaurant is clean: food and inside restaurant, included they want to relax from their work every day in a week or from their activity in daily life. If smell of cigarette or smoke of cigarette disturb your eating. What did you feel? Smell of cigarette destroy the atmosphere in the eating, feel bad with people who smoke in the restaurant. The best way to banned people who smoke in restaurant is stick the label of fine their money under the law in each other country or banned who want to smoke not come in the restaurant. If who want to smoke should be find the places that do not disturb other people. However non smoking since the first is the best because cigarette is no benefit and useful at all, it gives you bad health, hurt your body and mind including who close up with you. I agree with banning people smoking in the restaurant because there are several places that you can smoke without the restaurant. May be as the places without crowded of people or nobody in that area. For example in your secret zone etc.
