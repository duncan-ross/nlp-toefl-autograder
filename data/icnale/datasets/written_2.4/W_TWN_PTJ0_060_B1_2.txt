It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Though there may some people who think college students should study as hard as they can, there are many advantages for college students to have a part-time job.

Working is a duty every adult person who has ability has to do, which means it is inappropriate to refuse to work just because you are a student. Having a part-time job is a way to work and both take care of studying. Second, the intuiton fee of college and the need of buying textbook, having meals or paying the rent of house are a big burden to the parents and families, so to have a part-time job can help families to ease the pressure of paying the big amount of money. Third, because most of the college students have to face the challenge to find a good job after they graduate, to have a part-time job when they are students can not only broaden their horizons but also help them to find a job in the future. Employers usually tend to allow people who have experiences of working to become the new employee. According to these reasons above, it is good for college students to have a part-time job.
