I agree that college students should have a part-time job. Firstly, college should venture out into the workforce to gain some work experience. The events in the school compound differ from those in the workforce. Hence, it is important for the college students to pick up necessary skills to prepare them for the future. For those working in the frontline areas such as promoting items or the service counter, we learn to interact with customers and pick up effective relation skills. Moreover, for those working in the backroom, we are able to see how a company functions and also are given opportunities to participate in some project tasks. Secondly, taking a part-time job translates to more income for the college students. We realise that money is hard earned and hence learn to save up for rainy days and spend our money wisely. Not only that, the college students realise that there is no free lunch and so they are motivated to work harder in their studies. It can also act as extra finance if the college students want to further their studies in the future. Thus, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
