I disagree. At first, I have never smoked yet. I don't like smells of cigarettes and I know that smoking isn't good for health very much. So I don't smoke. Although some my friends smoke. They said that smoking is great after meals. Some of them are at work. When they will finish the job, they will sometimes go to the restaurants to have a dinner. Then they will be very tired. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, they won't have a great time after meals. And they won't be able to cure a tiredness of the job. Because it will be sad for them, I can't rob of smoking in restaurants. But it is uncomfortable of non-smoking people containing me to be smoked in restaurants. And it is more dangerous for the pregnant woman, children and babies to breathe on smokes of cigarettes. I think the smoking man must be care of the people around him when he smokes in restaurants. Now some restaurants separate from smoking and non-smoking area in Japan. I agree on the idea. I had better separate from smoking and non-smoking area than completely banned at all the restaurants. It will be good results for each other.
