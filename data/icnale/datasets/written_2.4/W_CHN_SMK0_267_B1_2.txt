 One of the hot issues many people complain about today is smoking in public places such as buses, cinemas and department stores, especially restaurants. Then should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I will say :NO! Neither because I'm addicted to nicotine nor I have many friends who drag do I disagree. And I admit that smoking is harmful both to the smokers and people around. I know that nobody will die of lung cancer if there is no smoker. And I'm pretty clear that if all smokers would break with the bad habit, our world will be much better. But I just don't think it is proper to deal with this social problem this way. I totally agree to forbid smoking in most restaurants, but there should be ones allowing. Smokers need places to relax and smoke, And it is not humane and we have no right to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Because we all have the right to decide what to do as long as there is no harm to others, just like gay or straight. I guess that is the same to smokers. I hope smokers will break that bad habit in the end, but we must guide our citizens step by step, ban at restaurants from a few to all. Only in that way can we solve this problem properly.
