In these times, there are a large part of college students who have a part-time job. However, as one of my university classmates, he had tried his best to do well both on grades and his job. But he lost; he quitted learning and left school at the second symmetry. From the aspect, I would say if you want to have a part-time job, paying more attention on your studies. Make sure you can control both sides. On the other hand, having a part-time job could enhance social techniques, such as communicating with others and how to get boss's goals. Having such experiences may give you more chances to get a job in the future when completing with others having no job experiences. Having a job means having salary. Thus, you can have all control on this money. Maybe it can be stored in the bank or be your tuition fee. However, most people just spend what they earn, and some even spend over what they have. So you must have a great idea of using money. In sum, do you want to get a part-time job during study? Can you promise that you can take care of yours school works? Do you have any idea for dealing with the money you earn? If your answers to the above questions are "Yes". Okay! Just go.
