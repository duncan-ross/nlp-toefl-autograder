As a college student, I became more aware of how I spend my money for my weekly expenses. My parents provide me with my weekly allowance, and it is up to me on how I will allot it for my personal needs and wants. But is it important for college students, such as I, to take part time jobs? As I have said earlier, I became more aware of how I spend my money because of the expenses which I have to put in mind. Proper allotment of money is needed, in order for me to prioritize my needs as a college student. I do not believe that it is important for a college student to take part time jobs. First of all, we already spend most of our time in school. We are already occupied with all the paper works and lessons which we have to accomplish. Taking part time jobs will only lessen our time in focusing with our schoolwork. Yes we may earn money, but it would have a huge impact on our performance in school. Second, it would really affect our health. Think about it, you spend most of your time in school and doing your assignments, lessons and paper works at home. With hardly any time to rest, how can you manage to work? Most jobs that one may apply for, would not consider making adjustments for the sake of the applicant. Though for some college students who have financial problems, working in a part time job is really important for it helps them to pay their expenses in their respective schools and to meet their basic needs.
