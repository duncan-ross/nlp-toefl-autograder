I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. I have reasons to support why it should be banned. Firstly, smoking is not good for smoker's health. Moreover, it is not either good for people who are around smoker. Smoking can cause cancer such as lung cancer, many diseases and it will make you look older than it should be. There are many people in restaurant, and they can smell smoke from smoker. Second, smoke is smelly. Its smell could trouble another people who do not smoke. When they are eating food, they should be eating happily, but when they smell smoking, it could make them cannot eat anymore. Therefore, it is not good to smoke in restaurant. It is dangerous for smoker's health and another people who around smoker. It is cause of cancer. Smoking can disturb another people who are eating food and make them do not want to eat any food. Therefore, if you want to smoke you should smoke in another place not in restaurant. The restaurant is not the place for smoking. It is a place for eating and enjoys meal. Therefore, it is better if smoking in restaurant is completely banned.
