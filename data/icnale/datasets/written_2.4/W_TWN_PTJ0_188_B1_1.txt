As a college student, I'm agree with we should have a part-time job when we are in college. Because we can have more pocket money and we can contact a different life. First, many college student don't know what should they be or what they want to be in the future. I think a college student should try to do various kinds of job, maybe they can find what is he/she's talent, and early to prepare be a member of society. Second, we learn many thing in college, for example, we learn the professional knowledge from the major classes, join the music band can learn the team work, and learn how to love. Furthermore, having a part-time job can learn more and substantial the college life. We can be independent, be responsibility, and to accumulate the experience. All of them are useful in our future. The least, the social skill is very important when we are in the workplace. How to make a friend and learn how to do with the boss is a lesson in the future, and if you have a good social skill, you will have more chance to get success. The college life has the four years long, you are impossible to study everyday. Most students have a part-time job in the free time, and its help them to have a direction and to see the world.
