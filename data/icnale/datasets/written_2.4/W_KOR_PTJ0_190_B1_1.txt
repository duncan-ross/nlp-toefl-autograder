Do you think part time job is good for you? I don't think so. These days many students want to have a part time job even high school students. When u went to high school, my friends had a part time job. So she can't concentrate study and class. She wanted to sleep. Her friendship drifted apart. In university, most of people have a part time job. Some people want to make their pocket money. On the other hand, they earn their school expenses by part time job. Because of they don't want to receive parent's money. But they are also can's concentrate their study. And sometimes they forgot their assignment. But sometimes part time job has good effect like they build their experience. And they work harder and they take the first step toward social life. But it is no good to high school student. When I go outside I can see many high school students work to wear high school uniforms. Some old people see that situation, they thought no good for their health and how to think. Why they want to part time job? Because of they want to buy some expensive things. So I think part time job are good and bad. But I don't want to suggest part time job during semester. If they want to something to buy, we can use vacation!
