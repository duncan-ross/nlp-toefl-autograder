I think every body has its own human right to smoke in pubic place. Some people may think it is not good to smoke in a public place, but in my opinion, it is OK for me. After all, every have his own right to choose what he wants. Maybe we can think other methods to this. I think we should make a place to stare apart the people smoke and other who do not. Maybe most of people think smoker make the air really bad. But we should not deplore others right no matter he smoke or not. So I think maybe we can plan different place for guys. Then we will not offense others space. But this may be difficult, because not every boss of the restaurant want to do this, but I have been to lots of restaurant, they do this idea, I think it is really nice, and fair to every one. In my opinion, no matter what we do, we should not make other people' right been deplore, we have to think other ways to solve it, to make everybody fair as much as we can. So, I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
