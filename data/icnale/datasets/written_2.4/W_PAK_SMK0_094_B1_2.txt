Smoking should be banned not only the country but all over the country. As success fully we have declared not to play cigarette commercials on tv. We are supposed to restrict the smokes to avoid smoking on public places. If we can hinder them to avoid smoking in family settings where children are usually present so question is why not in restaurants where we visit with our families. I think positive for your child or others should be same for others children individuals. In restaurants where we sit for eating drinking the dangerous smoke prevail around our food not only by breath but through our food in take. Some individuals are allergic to it and we can not agree to every one to stop smoking so its environment of the restaurants administration ban it for every person dining. Smoking is a poison who eat a person fastly. I through agree that the smoking should be banned over the country the factories where the cigarette and drugs made are should be banned. Good atmosphere is very important in hotels because these are clean and neat space. In so conclusion is it should banned in all public places and restaurants to avoid the risk of disputes and health factors.
