In the world, millions of people are smoking. They smoke seriously not only at home but also in the public. When they meet difficulties, they will smoke a lot. When they have a lot worry, they will smoke. But I think it should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, restaurants are public places. When the smokers smoke in the restaurant, I think they don't consider others' feeling. Restaurant is a place to eat food. Everybody wants to have a good appreciate. But if there is someone who is smoking, I think we can't have a good time to enjoy our food. Secondly, smoking not only harms to smokers, but also harm to others. Smoking can cause than 1000 deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects women, children, and elderly people. Scientists also suggest people to smoke less or give up smoke. If smokers want to smoke, they must go out the restaurants or at home. Thirdly, a banned can help encourage smokers to give up smoke. If it isn't allowed to smoke in the restaurant, they can smoke less than usual. Also they can have a good time to enjoy their delicious food. Above all, I think smoke should be banned at the restaurant. Do this is not only good for smokers themselves, but also good for people who live near with them.
