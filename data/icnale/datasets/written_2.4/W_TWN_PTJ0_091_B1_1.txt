I agree that students in college having a part-time job are very important. The most important reason is that students can learn more which they can't study in the school. For example, students can know how to treat other people more politely. Another reason is that students can earn their own money themselves. They may know how hard parents earn money to support them. After doing part-time job, students know that earning money is hard. Because of that they may think more when they buy things. In my opinions, students having a part-tine job are only good for students but also motive them to do well. They may think more when they make choice or they may do things carefully. Maybe there have some dangerous in part-time job but you don't have some dangerous you don't learn to grow up. Students are not always being prevented in parents' umbrella. They have to try to grow up. Doing part-time job makes them know more about this society and makes them think more for others. To strong their heart and to grow their thinking up is the advances doing the part-time job. You can learn other's advance and make that turning to your advance. Knowing more, thinking more and learning more are the reasons students having a part-time job.
