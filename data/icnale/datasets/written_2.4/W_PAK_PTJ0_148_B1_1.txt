Part time job has a lot of advantages. Much of our time is not wasted in this way. We can do our many works. Part time job means work at evening or second shift. In Pakistan most of students have to jobs second time because our economy is not very good, so the parents can not pay all the expenses so they said their children job part time and study first time so they have to do job at second time but much of their time wasted in this way, they can not pay full attention on their studies as a result They fail while on the other hand for other citizen( mean not students) get a some advantages of part time jobs, for examples teacher can teach in schools and colleges at first time and second time they can take their tuitions and earn some money, they can easily control the economy of their house and help their parents or family. Some boys who are going to foreign countries to get education. They have to jobs second time because the expenses of abroad countries are very high. In this way they have to work both time it is a benefit for them and help them in a lot of way that with this money they can manage(not easily) but the expenses of eating and housing. Nowadays most of the students and people have to jobs part time as well as second time because our economy is very weak than other countries. It is necessary to run a big family. To my point of view it is better to job part time than to get charity or to loan from others.
