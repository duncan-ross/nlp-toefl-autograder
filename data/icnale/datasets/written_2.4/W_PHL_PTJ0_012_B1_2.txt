When students reach the tertiary level of their education, most people, especially the older generation, would expect them to be independent and more mature. It is often recognized as the time where the person finds his/her own self and takes responsibility for whatever step he/she takes in his/her journey in finding his/her own identity. Having a job at this early time somehow helps the students in their path to self-knowledge. Earning money through their own tears and hardship will open their eyes to their future life after school; the real life, as what they say. It helps them manage themselves properly and find their strengths and at the same time, their weaknesses. Having a job doesn't only mean that they gain profit, but rather, it also helps them gain knowledge. Also, it is a big help to their family who have supported their education for at least the past nine years of their life. It would be their way of uplifting the burden on the shoulders of the people who've helped them reach where they are now. It's good to know that even at this early time of their life, they are already taking responsibility of their actions. But still, they should still know to prioritize their studies even if they already have a job.
