I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is true that there are some bad aspects to have a part-time job for college students, for example, we use a lot of time for part-time job so we don't study or we sleep in the class. But there are more good aspects to have a part-time job. I raise three reasons that I think so. First, we can know how difficult to earn money and how important money is. Many of us are depend on our parents in terms of economy, so we don't know how difficult to earn money. Having a part-time job tells us how difficult. And understanding it leads us to respect our parents. Second, we can get new skills that we can't get at college. I think having a lot of skills, even if it seems that those skills are not important; will be useful in the future. Third, we get the opportunity to talk with adults to do a part-time job. We can get a lot of information and knowledge. I think a lot of knowledge leads us happy. In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can know difficulty to earn money and can get new skills and get opportunity to talk with adults.
