I don't agree with this statement that is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think this because most students already have a full time job which is going to school. Our job as college students is to make our parents proud and get good grades so that we can eventually get a good career once we graduate. Also, some of us want to go to a master's degree or PHD program, and if we do poorly in our undergraduate studies it will be impossible to pursue this kind of opportunity. Students will have plenty of time to work after they graduate from college, and thus there is no reason to jump the gun and start using all your effort to do something that you have the rest of your life to do. The amount of money you can make by working in a part-time job is offset by the amount of money you can eventually make working at a fulltime job, so I think that student should enjoy the short time we have left to be kids and not have to be too serious. For these reasons and many more, I think it is obvious that college students should not have to have a part-time job.
