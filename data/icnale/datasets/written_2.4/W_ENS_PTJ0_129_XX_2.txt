I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I mean really, students have enough to do already with humongous amounts of study anyway. It only makes life more difficult if they have to work too. I know it was much harder for me and I am still paying back the college loans that I took out. Some friends of mine believe that it gives them some experience and I can see their point and suggest that work experience during the college vacations would be OK. I think what is more important than having a part time job is getting a good average and doing well with studies. Most companies don't care if prospective recruits worked at Macdonald s while they were studying or were pulling night shifts at the local food mall. Doing extra work only means that students have less time to study and puts extra pressure on them to perform. Time enough for work when they finish college I think and although I think that it may be necessary for some, like it was with me because I needed the extra cash to pay my way, it is still an extra workload to cope with. They will have plenty of time to build character and get more work experience after college I think.
