Many people have the unfortunate need to smoke while eating every now and then. To accommodate this need, there have been restaurants that allow their customers to smoke. The restaurants are aptly able to satisfy the needs of the customers by separating the smoking section from the rest. However, there have been several instances when the smoke from the separated section reaches the nonsmoking area which cause discomfort with most nonsmoking customers. An instance would be the opening of the door leading to the smoking section which consequently allowed the smoke from that section to move to the nonsmoking area. The possible discomfort of the customers can be result of several reasons. One of the common reasons is the smell. For a nonsmoker, the smell of cigarette can be quite repulsive and can even cost their appetite at times. Another possible reason is that they can become second-hand smokers which are a more dangerous situation than first-hand smokers according to research. Also, they tend to have the feeling that part of the smoke seem to be attached to the food it passes through, further resulting in their reluctance to eat. It can then be noticed that the risk is that the majority of a restaurant's customers, who are nonsmokers, can be quite unsatisfied. Their discomfort can be factor in the decrease of a restaurant's profit and it cannot be denied that their health can be affected in a negative manner. Also, a smoker can always make ways such that they will not have the urge to smoke while eating. Furthermore, there is a slight chance of lessening their smoking if they do not smoke while eating. Thus, it would be better and healthier to completely ban smoking in all restaurants.
