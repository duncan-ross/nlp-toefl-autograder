I agree with that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To study from the books is not enough for students to learn. They have to go outside to discover the real world, and to earn money by themselves. If students have a part-time job, they will know how big is the world so they have to be strong by themselves. When I was a student, I used to play a lot and all I knew is studying and playing. After studying I would just play computer games all the day. I had a part-time job this summer vacation because I found that everybody was always thinking that I am just like a kid. I started to get in touch with my job teammates and the boss. I found that everything is difficult to me and that I have to find answers on my own. In addition, I finally knew that earning money is not easy; I can't waste my money taking from my parents anymore. Moreover, I learned that I have to be more aggressive than I was. To do so, I can learn more in my life and life will become more interesting. Now I am courageous to face the world which will come after graduating. I agree with that having a part-time job for college students is important because it gives students opportunities to learn from the real living world but not books. Students will learn more before they really touch the career.
