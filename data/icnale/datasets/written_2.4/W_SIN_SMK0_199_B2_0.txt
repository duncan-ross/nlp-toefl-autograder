The harmful health effects of smoking both to the smoker and the people in the surroundings due to second-hand smoke have long been established by scientific studies. However, for economic reasons smoking is not completely banned in Singapore. The Singapore government's stand is of one that neither encourages nor discourages smoking. There are health campaigns to curb smoking such as the design of cigarette packaging to show the undesirable damage caused by prolonged smoking to one's lungs. Recently, non-smoking regions have also been implemented in certain public eating places. This serves to shield the non-smokers from unavoidable second-hand smoke produced by diners eating in the close proximity. It also succinctly marginalises the smokers from the non-smokers as one might observe the number of seats available in the smoking region is clearly less than the seats in the smoke-free regions. This seeks to create inconvenience for the smokers rather than to safe guard the health of the non-smokers. Through this inconvenience and marginalisation, smokers might be encouraged to quit smoking. It is questionable though as to how effective this initiative might be in putting pressure on smokers as only certain eating places have took part in this campaign and these smokers are still able to smoke while they dine as long as they can get a seat in the smoking region. Being a non-smoker myself, I would definitely have no qualms in supporting the total ban of smoking at all restaurants as I do not comprehend the positive enjoyment that these smokers derive from it. But I believe that the government should not totally restrict people from exercising their freedom to smoke and the banning of smoking should instead be left to the choice of the management of restaurants to decide what kind of dining experience they want to cater.
