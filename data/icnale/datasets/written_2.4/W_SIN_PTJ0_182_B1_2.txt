I am of the opinion that while it is valuable for college students to have a part-time job, it is not necessarily important as it may bring about detrimental effects such as distraction from studies. Part-time jobs essentially provide a means of income for college students --- who are very often not receiving any income (and living allowance from parents for many), yet burdened by the debts of tuition fees and rising cost of living. A part time job in this case would provide monetary and financial assistance to the student and is legitimate because the student earns whatever he has worked for. Using private tutoring as an example, a student is able to flexibly slot in tuition assignments into his personalised timetable. The amount of money earned is proportionate to the effort (number of assignments he takes up). Secondly, on a similar note on savings and financial prudence, having a prt-time job allows college students to understand the hardships of working and will allow them to cherish money more, and spend their money wisely. However, a very important drawback of the aforementioned benefits of having a part-time job is that it distracts students, and inevitably affects his academic work detrimentally. Having a part-time job would mean lesser time devoted to revising and studying. Although it can be argued that with proper planning, revision can still be completed regularly, I am inclined to think the physical and mental draining of a part-time job will outweigh proper planning and even with proper planning, one is still inevitably affected in terms of fatigue and time lost.
