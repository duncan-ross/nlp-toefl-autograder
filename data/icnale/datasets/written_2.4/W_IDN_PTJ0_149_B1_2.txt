Part time job for college students is somewhat sounds good for the students. One of the advantages is you are trained to manage your time as efficient as possible. You can also make an additional income for your needs, buy gadgets / things you like, or even pay your tuition fees yourself without the help of your parents. However, working part time is also has disadvantages. One of them is your time for studying or for doing the other teen's thing is decreased. As a student, you must prior your studies. Don't let working part time as your number one priority. You'll make your parents disappointed if your grades are bad. The affectivity of working part time is also depends on the motivation of the students, whether the part time job is related with their studying or not. Nowadays, most of the students are working part time only for find an income. They don't mind if the job doesn't related with their studies or not. As long as they got a lot of money and the job is quite easy, they'll take it. But, it is okay if they can manage their time. As a conclusion, I think that having part time job for college students is good, but I will more agree if the job is related with the studies because it gives us experience. In our teen's life, I think that gaining experience is much more important than gaining income.
