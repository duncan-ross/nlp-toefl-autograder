I do not agree with smoking, because smoking can cause many types of diseases. When people go to eat at the restaurants, there must be signs for forbidding smoking. People must respect regulations or rules so everyone can live together happily. If someone wants to smoke, that one should step outside the restaurants or go to other areas so that the smoking cannot harm others. People whoever love just having meals, they will enjoy their dishes and go back home happily. I think if people take action into the policy that the restaurants should not allow people to smoke, this problem could be fixed easily. The problem is that even they put the signs in front of the restaurants, some of them still allow people to smoke in the restaurants. And many customers don't respect and follow the rules. They just do whatever they want without care about other people who don't enjoy with the smoke. Many people die in a recently year because of smoking. Lives in city is very dangerous, not just only get smoke from cars and factories, but we also get smoke from cigarettes. How can we have a healthy life? It is very hard to get it. I hope that, people can do it, there should be cooperatives between smokers and the owners of all restaurants. If they respects the rules and cooperate with each other, banning smoking can be happen.
