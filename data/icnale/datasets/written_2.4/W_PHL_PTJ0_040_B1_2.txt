It is interesting that now, after so many years of ignoring it, parents are urging their children to take part-time jobs. Although many might consider it unnecessary as they come from well-off families, having a part-time job not only gives the child more money, it also teaches very important values which can help the child later on in life. First, it teaches the child independence. Since the child no longer has to depend on his parents giving him his allowance for his daily sustenance, he now has a sense of independence which will help him later on in life. This is a very crucial trait to teach to a child. Secondly, it teaches the child to be responsible. When one has a job, he is trusted to complete the tasks assigned to him. And unlike school where non-compliance simply results in a verbal reprimand, the child is exposed to a world with real consequences. As a result, the child learns accountability and responsibility. Finally, a part-time job would develop a child's self-confidence –he now earns money and can buy what he wants without having to beg his parents. This gives the child a sense of achievement which, in turn, improves a child's self-confidence. This helps him later on in life as he faces various challenges. So, one can see that a part-time job has numerous benefits in bringing up a child-it is not only an added source of income. This is why parents must encourage their children to take up part-time jobs. a
