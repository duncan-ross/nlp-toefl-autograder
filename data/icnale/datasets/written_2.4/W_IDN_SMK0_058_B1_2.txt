In the past, smoking in the public area, especially in the restaurants, was something that you could see anywhere because there are no rules or cautions about it. Many people smoke in the public area without any hesitation and it is be something common in people daily life. Recently, it became hot news because one of government organization said that smoking in the public area is not allowed. That condition happened because that organization thinking about effects of smoke. As we knew, effects of smoke are so dangerous to our body. Not only it can cover our lungs with toxic, but also it will be carcinogenic that can develop to be cancer, decrease our lifetime and lungs capacity itself. Moreover, effects of smoke not only attack the smoker itself, but also people that surround him. And the effects itself is more harm to the passive smoker (people surround the smoker) than the active smoker (the smoker). In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only because it damage our body, but also there are few fire cases in the restaurants that caused by fire from the butts. And it will be something risky if because of little things like butts destroy all of materials and damage people's life.
