I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking becomes a serious social problem these days. There are so many smoker in our community not only teenagers but also women. They usually smoke everywhere include bar, pub, cafe or PC room and so on. They go as far as to smoke in public area like restaurant. Restaurant is the place where people eat some food and get nutrients from dishes. There are many children and other people in that place. If smoker smoke in restaurant, it can arouse disease on the people around him or her. Second-hand smoke can cause life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer. There are some new study which showed that second-hand smoke can cause lung cancer to non-smokers, and it also can cause premature death to child and adult. Because of carelessness many people can be damaged their health. For making our safe and healthful community, we have to completely ban at all public area like restaurants in all society. If someone who smoke in public area, we have to condemn him to pay a fine or get a impose penalty points. We have to protect our neighbors from second-hand smoke.
