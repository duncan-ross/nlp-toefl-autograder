 In my opinion, I don't agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think it just should not be banned in all parts of the restaurants but the public areas. Actually smoking does harm to one's health especially the second-hand smoke affects most people around. However, at the same time, it also an effective way for one to relax his brain and spirits. As to my memory, restaurant is not just the place for people to have meals, sometimes it also can be a good place for us to chat with our family members and good friends as well as relax ourselves. During these activities, smoking properly can effectively relax one's brain as a result of nicotine. So why should it be banned at all the restaurants? As a saying goes: What exist is reasonable. Now that cigarette exists, it has its own use. Despite smoking heavily, smoking properly is acceptable, as long as it won't affect the people around. And if it is banned at all the restaurants in the country, I believe that there must be lots of people object to this. Why do things that will make so many people uncomfortable? Like drinking, smoking also need to be forgiven in the restaurants. So just forgive smoking a bit, don't ban it at all the restaurants in the country. That's all.
