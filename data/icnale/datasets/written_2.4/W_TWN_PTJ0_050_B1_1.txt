In my opinion, I think a college student should have a part-time job at least. Going to work is a direct way to improve some concept we should have. No matter what jobs, having a job must can learn many things. We can have a lot experience before we going to work full time. Part-time jobs can help us more sensitive to everything we touch at first time. Nowadays many of boss think the young people have less basis knowledge on work, such like be on time, be responsible, and so on. Even some boss says that they feel they like a mother. They have to take much care of young people. Try to tell them what should do, and what should not to do. But there are still some ways can learn the experience which we have to get on part-time jobs. I think college is a small society, everybody may learn more things that we can't learn from books. Taking an example, we can play many fun things with a lot of friends. Making a lot of friends also can learn how to be together with each other. Many things have to learn and balance, such as fall in love, know lot friends, or get high grades. However, our finally goal always find a good job, so learn a lot experience on jobs may better.
