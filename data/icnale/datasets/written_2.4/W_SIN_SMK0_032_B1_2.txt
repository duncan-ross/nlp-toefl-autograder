I do feel that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Singapore since the government is encouraging smokers to quit smoking. Although it is up to ones' own rights as to decide whether they want to smoke, not banning of smoking in restaurants could result in more smokers continue to smoke. Since it is a public space, young children who are perceived as vulnerable, will follow the act of these smokers as the scenes of smokers smoking have been normalized. Furthermore, smoking in the public space could also cause harms to those who are non-smokers. According to research study, harmful second hand smoke will cause more harm to non-smokers than to smokers. This is quite unfair to non-smokers. Also, smoking in restaurants could pollute the eating environment which in turns affect ones' dining experience as well as the taste of the food. If the government does not imposed stricter regulation on smokers in restaurants, the number of smokers might not decrease but in turn increase as the act of quiting smoking not only requires one's own effort but also those around them. If a smoker whom wants to quit smoking accidentally saw someone smoking, it will be hard for them to resist this temptation. Thus, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Singapore.
