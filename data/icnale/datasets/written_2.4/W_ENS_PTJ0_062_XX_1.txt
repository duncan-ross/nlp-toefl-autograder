I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have had a part-time job ever since I was in high school, and this has made me a much more mature and contributing member of society that some of my friends. In the modern world, it is very hard to grow up and there are no real marks of whether or not you are a full adult, but having a part-time job in college is one of the ways which you can demonstrate your responsibility and also make some cash which you can use as you want. For myself and many other girls, we like to shop a lot, and so it is good to have a continuous flow of income so that we're not cutting into our savings or we want to go have a little shopping spree with the girlfriends. This is not to say that boys do not do the same thing, but they might be a little bit better at controlling their bank accounts and so they do not have to worry about it as much. Also, we have to buy a lot of makeup and other things too maintain our appearances, and a lot of this stuff is not cheap. Many people might think these are some stupid reasons to have a part-time job, but to me they're perfectly good, and so I will use them to state unequivocally that most college students can have a part-time job.
