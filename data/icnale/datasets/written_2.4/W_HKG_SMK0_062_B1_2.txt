Recently, the financial report has imposed higher taxation on cigarettes for HKD$5 on each cigarette which are available in Hong Kong. And also smoking was prohibited for several years in indoor area. These policies have shown the physical consequences of taking cigarette to every citizen in our country. Smoking will not only affect the health of the person who smoke but also influence others by passive smoking. So it is not surprising that smoking should be prohibited at all public area. Imagine that when you are having a dinner with your lover. The moment that you want to have the first taste of your meal, you suddenly smell that the restaurant is full of smoke as someone is smoking nearby. You are struggling between whether you have the right to stop that person from smoking and your health. What would you do? A place for meal becomes a place for smoke. It is really unfair for those people who are not smoke at all to suffer passive smoking induced by the smoker in the public area. This unfairness occurs especially in a restaurant, a confine environment, which secondhand-smokers are forced to breathe the air that they clearly understand it is contaminated. Therefore, it is taken for granted that smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
