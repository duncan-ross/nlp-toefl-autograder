Today, many college students have part-time jobs. Isn't their job study? What are the benefits for students to have a job? Is having a part-time job so important? I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First, having a part-time job not only helps students to learn how to social with people live outside their schools and families but also improves their talking skills. That would make them handle things better than others. Meeting varies persons, by the way, would open their eyes. Second, it gives more chances for college students to know how different jobs worked. That will help them to find their interest careers after graduate. It also let students know that earn money isn't as easy as they thought, and won't waste money on unnecessary things. But I only agree students to have part-time jobs in vacations, not during school days. Because college life is so wonderful that everyone should enjoy it, not to use all your free time on works. Students should pay more attention on school works and outdoor activities, such as mountain climbing and beach swimming. Although having a part-time job is important, it is still only a small part of the college life. You'll have whole-life long time for work, so don't be so worried about money now. Enjoy your college life!
