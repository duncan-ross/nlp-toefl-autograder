Since I work in a restaurant, I feel I have a great perspective to offer on this situation. Personally, I find it very offensive when our patrons decide to smoke in the restaurant. It is not actually illegal, but I do think it has a negative impact on the restaurant and our image as a professional and caring workplace. Also, there are a lot of kids that eat at our restaurant, and they should not have to deal with the cigarette smoke at such a young age. It is much easier for them to get sick and to have their health harmed badly by the cigarette smoke, but also, we have to work for a long time in the restaurant every day, so if it is smoky, that can really make your head ache and drain your energy. I hope that one day someone will ban smoking officially at my restaurants. And although I don't know much about the situation in Japan, I will definitely decide not to go there to work at a restaurant until they get this issue figured out and they can guarantee me that I will not have to work in a dirty environment. As a cook, I do feel that smoking should be banned in restaurants.
