I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job and there are some reasons and one example. I ever had just stayed home and did nothing but playing online games and sleeping on summer vacation of my second grade. I made a perfect schedule to enrich my summer time like studying English three days a week, going jogging, learning cooking with my mother and so on...... At first, I was very work hard to achieve every goal I ruled and made up the delay activities conscientiously and carefully. However, I became lazier and lose interest about it and gave up all the goals and indulged myself in online games. In the end, I had no gains but body weight. There are many reasons for this concept. First, part-time job can make students more independent when they can gain money by themselves not by their parents. Second, they can learn how to deal with the other different people and work. Third, they can be more confident of getting job because it is an honor to themselves. Fourth, they always have a lot of vacation on their studying period so they can use the spare time to do and learn more things they don't do and learn in the class. Last but not least, they maybe will encounter the very important person who will change their life and make them grow. So, why don't college students have a part-time job?
