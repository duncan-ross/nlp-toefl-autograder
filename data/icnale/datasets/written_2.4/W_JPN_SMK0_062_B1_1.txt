I disagree with this statement. There are two reasons to do it. First, if all restaurants in Japan ban to smoke, they miss their guests. I think that people go to restaurant not only eat foods but also enjoy the time. I heard that people who like to smoke very much get irritated without smoking. They cannot enjoy under the situation. So they do not want to go to restaurant. Although people who dislike smoking think restaurant should ban to smoke, smoking seat and not smoking seat are separated in restaurant now, so I think restaurant do not have to ban smoking. Second, I think Japanese government will be damaged. I guess that if all restaurant ban to smoke, this change make many smokers to decide to ban smoking. Although it sounds good to many people, smokers like them are get irritated and may become sick because of the no smoking life stress. I heard that smokers who ban to smoke have higher risk to be cancer than other smokers. So if restaurant ban it, people who have cancer may increase. And more and more sick people exist, more and more money government pay to these people. On the other hand, smokers who ban smoking increase, the smoking tax decrease. So government budget is cut. Although I dislike smoking and do not want to smoke, if the statement are realized, many problems happen. So I disagree with the statement.
