The importance of a job nowadays is not only important for grown-ups, it is also important for college students to have a part-time job while going to school. Having experience in working is very important and beneficial for an individual. Even working in a basic and simple job, the individual is able to be taught responsibility and the difficulty of earning money. For my experience, before going to college, I already had a part-time job in high school. In Canada, the minimum age that a person is allowed to work is the age of 15. Reaching that age, I quickly applied and got my first job at a food court selling French fries. The simple job taught me a lot on what it takes to work. I had to cook, clean, and handle the finances (cashier) with either a partner or sometimes by myself. Over time I gradually upgraded my jobs to working in a sales department where I would receive more money for the things I do. By the time I was in college, I had a lot of experiences and it was easier to get other jobs with higher standards. Before having to go back to Indonesia to continue my father's businesses, I was already working at an office for the school. By having a part-time job, it expands your knowledge in life and you are able to be more mature. Another benefit is the money you receive as well. The money that you receive teaches you that earning money is not easy and people do have to work for it. Currently, I am running my own business while attending IEU and I can manage it due to my past experiences which I am grateful to have.
