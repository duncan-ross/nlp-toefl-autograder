Nowadays, more and more students have a part time job because of a variety of reasons. Some students work in order to pay his tuition, while some students spend their time in order to make living on his own, and I strongly agree with the statement that college students have to have a part-time job because of the following two reasons. First of all, by having a part time job, you can have more freedom to control your life. Being economically independent is one of the most important things that should be done prior to depart from one's parents when he/she goes to university. Plus, by having a part time job, students can earn money, which finally helps them to achieve what they have planned. For example, I have seen many friends of mine who traveled around the world with the money they earned during their semester. Secondly, by working at a part time job, students are able to experience the real world or real society earlier than the students who do not. In many cases, part time jobs include a food-serving, a company's assistant, or a cashier at a store. During their working time, they are supposed to face a lot of real-life situations, by handling or solving that problem, they can grow up as real adults. This kind of precious experience cannot be bought through any other method or money. In conclusion, having a part time job is really important and crucial for college students because it is very helpful for students' whole life. We should remember that there is something that is more than just money, but something that can only be acquired through our variety of experiences in college life. Go get a job immediately!
