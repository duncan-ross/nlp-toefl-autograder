I think a part-time job is a great way for any student to expand their experience in college and learn a lot of lessons that they would have to learn later in the workforce. A part-time job is a great way to prepare for graduating college, and since I am a proponent of following one's own opinions, I have had a part-time job for quite a long time. When I graduate with my PHD in the spring of next year, I think I will have enough education and enough part-time experience to secure a really excellent full time position, and I also am considering staying in the university and beginning a teaching profession. As a result, my part-time tutor jobs and other jobs I have held in the university will be a valuable asset to me. In the same way, other college students may accrue valuable experience which will be related to their future careers and in the process ensure themselves the opportunity to land an excellent job. Also, having a part-time job is really a godsend when any financial difficulties come up, and it is really a relief to not have to worry about a sudden medical bill or an unexpected repair bill for the car or the house to destroy my bank account.
