Cigarette smoking is bad for your health, no smoking, and smoking leads to lung cancer. These are just some of the anti-smoking campaigns that we always hear in radios, television, and especially from the government. Even though we have this kind of campaign there are still people who continue in smoking like in public places especially in restaurants. Smoking can also lead other diseases if they don't stop. But, the worst is smokers are not the only one who will experience respiratory infections and other diseases but also the people who can smell the smoke of the cigarette known as the secondhand smokers. Like, in restaurants there are so many people there eating and imagine that there are impolite people who continuously smoke inside, people will be irritated of the unpleasant smell of the cigarettes. And these may also lead to stop the operation of those restaurants if they will continue to tolerate this king of doing. So, the government and other officials are doing their best to ban the use of cigarettes in all public places. Like, they have this kind of project that they will increase the tax in cigarette products. The banning of cigarette smoking in public places are not new to us anymore especially to the smokers. Some smokers will not stop until they experience the complications brought by smoking. Stop and do not wait until the government will increase the price of a cigarettes and increase the punishment in people who are smoking in public places. So, stop smoking before it is too late in order for us to have smoke free country.
