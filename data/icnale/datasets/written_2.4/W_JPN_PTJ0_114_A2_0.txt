I agree with the statement. I think part-time job is first step to our own future job. Because, we can experience various job. There are service occupation, tutor and remover at time-part job. I think it is important for us to continue the work which we will hope and get in the future till we retire. And, to continue it as long as possible, we have to get an occupation agreeable to my taste. On the other hand, I think that it cannot help giving up the part-time job, if it isn't agreeable to me. But, it is bad to give up it for no reason. I think it is the best to find which field of jobs is the most agreeable to me by having it. So, in the future, we can select work and are likely to make an appeal for the experience at a part time job to the company. Then, we can also study the rule of society. When we spend times in our daily life, we have only chance to speak our friend, family and teacher. But, when we work, we can know many rules. For example, when we speak to our superior and customers, we have to use honorific word and speak politely and not to get angry easily. And, we can acquire useful and good manners. However, some people say college students's main occupation is study. Surely, it is right. If we worked too long to go to school, our achievement would decline and we would make our parents sad. If we became so, it would be too bad. Thus, I think it is the most important to work when we have free time. And, it is the best of us to acquire various skills, manners without lazing about study.
