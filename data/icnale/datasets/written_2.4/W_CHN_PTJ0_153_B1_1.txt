I think that it is important for college students to find part-time job. In present society, an increased number of students go in society to find part-time jobs. It is popular for college students to find a part-time job. That is why I support the idea that it is important for college students to have part-time job. In my opinion, as college students, we should not focus only on our study. We are adults now and we cannot stay in a so-called safe environment. We should step into the society to know exactly the world and meet more kinds of people. This will make good preparations for your future after graduation. You can learn a lot by doing part-time jobs. You will be more mature and responsible. Contacting with different kinds of people will enable you to become good at dealing with them in the future. On the other hand, you can earn money from it. Thus you can lose the burden of the family. And you can buy things you want with the money and help others who have financial problems. In one word, finding a part-time job carefully is important and useful no matter to yourself or the family. You can practice yourselves and earn money, isn't it wonderful. But you must be careful when finding it.
