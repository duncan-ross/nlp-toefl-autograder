I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking could prohibited absolutely in the public area and restaurants. It cause more effect to people Who do not smoking by its smoke that is very bad. The restaurants could have a beautiful atmosphere Where have not smoking. So it should be banned. The smoke consist of many bad gas such as Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide and smell of cigarette. In Thailand, the government is worry about Smoking so the government has created the smoking prohibited project. But in the real, the smoking Hasn't disappeared. Many people may smoking because it is either be a trend of smart or decrease Their stress. So restaurants can banned smoking by cutting this trend. There can show the good trend Picture or advertiser then when smoking people see that they will not smoke in the restaurant. Next, the government must completely banned smoking in the restaurant and have a clearly rule for The people who do not do by the rule. Then I think in the future the restaurant could not have Completely smoking and the beautiful atmosphere in the restaurant. The customer will enjoy with This improvement absolutely.
