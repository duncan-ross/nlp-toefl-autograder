Many people have to take on part-time work to afford it. Others work full-time while attending classes part-time. It's the nature of higher education these days and likely to get more expensive soon. But not everyone has to work to pay their way through school. They get by either through a full ride scholarship, family affluence or student loans. For whatever reason, these students do not have to so they don't. So many people look at college as an opportunity to socialize, to find themselves and to explore the world before going out into it. College has been defined as a "safe place for young people to grow. " To that end they spend as much of their free time engaged in pursuits other than class work as possible. There's value in doing this to some degree but too often students just engage in mindless, risky behavior. Every time you see GIRLS GONE WILD you're witnessing wasted time, wasted money and wasted opportunity. Some students don't know the value of work experience and how it can enhance the educational experience. At least one semester of work would benefit ALL students by: - giving them money that they've earned, - giving them satisfaction, - giving them experience in the field their degree is in, - fill some of their idle time, - teach them to meet the punctuality requirements of the working world, So under this question, the answer is some students don't want to work perhaps because they feel their time could be better spent in other pursuits. Could they benefit from a part-time job? Certainly, but nobody has made it mandatory yet. And as long as they have a choice, some of them are going to - Just Say No.
