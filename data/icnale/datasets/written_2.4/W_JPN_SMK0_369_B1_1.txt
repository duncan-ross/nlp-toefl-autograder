I have a friend who usually smokes. But I dislike smoking. Some like smoking, others don't like it. Smoking affects health, but many people have smoked for long time. Now in Japan smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. Generally, restaurant is where people eat food. People who don't smoke should not allowed smoking at that place. I hared that after eating or drinking smoking is best. So for people who like smoking that place is best place, but for people who don't like smoking that place is worst place, because while they eat nice foods, they must smell smoking which they don't like. Even if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants I n Japan, everyone doesn't have a trouble. People who like smoking only endure smoking. If they don't endure, they only go out of restaurant in order to smoking. Smoking banned happens things have merits and demerits. But merits clearly are larger than demerits. Then why government don't ban smoking at all the restaurants. People may don't react that. However I heard that smoking areas are gradually decreasing. Perhaps in near future smoking may be banned at all place, and smoking may be lost, and people may be can live a long life.
