The population of people who are addicted to smoking is growing rapidly. It is a sociable problem for many countries. A lot of associations contribute to ban this phenomenon completed at all the restaurants in the country. Personally, I would prefer to support this idea. First, it is known to all that smoking is harmful to people's health. Nicotine in the cigarettes is the most brutal killer while lung is the poorest victim. Each part of our body hurt will have some influence on our health. Not only for us but also for our families, keeping away from smoking is important. Second, restaurant is a public place, from the angle of the manner, smoking in the restaurants is not polite to people who don't smoke. To keep the good relationship with others, people should stop this behavior. Third, receiving the smoke that other people produce is equal bad for health. When one person is smoking, other people are passive to breathe the smoke, they have no choice. To solve this problem, many public places set a special area for smoking people, but this solution may not always work well and it is can't prevent smoking from the root. Law is always the most powerful way to protect public's rights. So government should approve of the suggestion smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is a public welfare that will benefit all the people!
