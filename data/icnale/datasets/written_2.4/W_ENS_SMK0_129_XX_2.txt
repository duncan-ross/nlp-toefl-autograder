It shouldn't be banned, but it should be controlled. Banning smoking in all restaurants in Japan would be over-regulating in my opinion. Governments already have too much control over what citizens do all around the world. You have to draw the line somewhere or all democracies will deteriorate into communist states which would be detrimental to all. Let business owners and private citizens decide as far as the restaurants go and allow the people to have some free will and a say in how they run their lives and businesses. Most of the restaurants that I have been in do smell a bit smoky because of crappy ventilation. If they could divide the customers into different, partitioned sections with good extraction fans, I think that would be enough for most non smokers. I am not a smoker and as much as I don't like the smell, I don't believe that I should be enforcing my will on to everybody else and no government should either. I think that they would be really stepping over the line if they want to discriminate in the so called interests of everyone's health. Keep it fair for all I say and just have a bunch of good extraction fans.
