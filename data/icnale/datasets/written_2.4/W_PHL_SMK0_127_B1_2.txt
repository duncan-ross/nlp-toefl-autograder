I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because almost everyone goes into a restaurant. Eating in the restaurants is like the bonding of most of the families. Meaning their children will be with them, so there is a big chance that they will be exposed to those people smoking. Not all children are being guided by their parents and or may have no idea what smoking is. So children may think that it is good and cool thing that they may adopt it, what they don't know is it doesn't provide any single good benefit for our body. Smoking kills. To my mind, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants and cafes must be banned. Restaurants are for eating, not smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. The scientists are sure that passive smoking is harmful for our health at the same value. I want to say that banning smoking is necessary measure for health of nation. In my opinion, we have to prohibit advertisement of cigarettes on mass media and parents have to explain the damage of cigarettes to their children. We all are responsible for future of our generations. Those countries, who had already forbidden smoking in public places had done a big step forward, compare to the countries that have not done it yet.
