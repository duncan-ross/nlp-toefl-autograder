Personally I agree with this statement. Does't like meddle school or high school where students' main duty is to learn hard and try to be enrolled in a good college, college's flexible environment enable its students to develop themselves in a all-around way. Many people has the opinion that studying in a college is the preparation to be engaged in the complex social enviroment and that's the idea I appreciated. A part-time job will provide students a opportunity to contact society in a early time. Many students will feel at sea once they graduate from the college if they don't have a well preparation for integrating into the society. Then comes part-time jobs advantage: it will force students learn to communicate with other people and to deal with kinds of situations like having conflicts with their boss, colleagues and so on. However there comes the voice that taking a part-time will greatly occupy students'time and distract them from their study. As far as I'm concerned, I argue against this opinion. By doing a part-time job, we can apply what we learn in the class into practise. Through this way we can have a better understanding of the knowledge and gain experience what we can't get from teacher in class. For the reason I state above, I strongly appreciate that college students should take a part-time job.
