Now in the universities more and more students take a part time job. There are many reasons that can explain these phenomena. To start with, many university students think a part time job is necessary. First, they can earn some money through the part time job to ease their parents' burden. Second, they can communicate with people out of school and learn much knowledge in the society. Doing a part time job can widen their field of vision. The experience of doing a part time job will do well to them when they find a job after gradating from the school. What's more, there are also many people who against a part time job. They insist that one's time is limited. If a student spends much time on a part time job, he or she will pay less attention to his or her study. And the society is too complicated. Students should not enter into it when they don't have the ability to deal with it well. Last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, we should make a good attitude towards the part time job. As a student, what we should pay most attention to is our studies. Then in we spare time we can do some good part time job, such as a tutor. That may become good experience in our university life.
