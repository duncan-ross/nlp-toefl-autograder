When you are enjoying a meal in a restaurant, the man who sits near you is smoking, would you feel have no interest in enjoying the delicious food and think the man is very tiresome. I don't know your answer, but I know when this happen to me, I would. I think it is a very bad behavior to smoking in public places, especially in restaurant, First, when one is smoking, other people besides him is also harmed by the secondhand smoke. As we know, secondhand smoke is worse for our health. Especially for women and children, they are affected more deeply. Many diseases are caused by smoke and secondhand smoke, this fact can't be ignored. Second, smokings in a restaurant makes many guests can't enjoy their meals, many people who don't smoke dislike smoking smell. Like me, when I smell smoke, I fell uncomfortable. When I come into a place filled with smoke, I can even not breathe. When we go to a restaurant, what we want is having a good meal and enjoying it rather than smelling secondhand smoke and we should have the right. So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should think about others more often and avoid smoking in public places.
