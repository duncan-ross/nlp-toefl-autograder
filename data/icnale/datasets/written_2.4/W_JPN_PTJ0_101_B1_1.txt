I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. At first, we can develop sociability and cooperation by part-time job. Now, I have a part-time job. Before I have a part-time job, I wasn't good at talking with elder people. I think it is because I wasn't in such an environment like spending a time with strange elder people. At part-time job, there are different generation people. I could get to be good at different generation people by part-time job. Second, we can learn a responsibility by part-time job. Part-time job is not a play. We must have a responsibility when we work. Third, we can get money by part-time job. I think the most reason why students have a part-time job is to get money. Money is necessary to enjoy ourselves. Of course, the most important thing for college students is studying. But I think students shouldn't just study. We will graduate from college someday, and we will work at some office. When we work, sociability, cooperation, and responsibility is very important. Without them, we will not succeed. The experience from time-part job will be very useful. So I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job.
