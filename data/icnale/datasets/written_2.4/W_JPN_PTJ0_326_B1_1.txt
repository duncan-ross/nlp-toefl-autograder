I agree with being important for college students to have a part-time job. At first, we will be social workers in a few years. We must experience various things in the society. And some people of the same age who do not go to the college have already worked in a society. So we have enough abilities to have a part-time job. We only learn at a college for doing good job in the future. We must have a time effectively because they have more free time than others had worked in the society. Moreover, we can consider about the value of the money. I think it is the most important things that we earn by ourselves and we recognize the pleasure and the pain for earning. We can realize then for the first time what our parents have troubled for us. This is also important things before working in the society. Actually, I felt so by having a part-time job. Secondly, Working by ourselves teaches us not only the way of using money but also the way of having times. What we are accustomed to using times effectively will help us when we graduated the college and got a job. What we can have a part-time job during a college student is a very good chance. Both continuing one part-time job and having various part-time jobs will be the great experience for us in the future. We must practice for working in the society by having a part-time job during a college student.
