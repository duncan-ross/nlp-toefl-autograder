I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because nobody is supported because it is very bad thing to do when people have food and should not be made or produce because it will make others suffer with clients and customers will pumping inhale tobacco smoke into the body, it would be if the child is not appropriate. Map narrowed to smoke because of the danger to children if they think the smoke should smoke outside the restaurant out if the shop owner to customers smoking in restaurants has narrowed the restaurant will make it ineffective and no. Standard cigarette making and giving customers less if the owner wishing to attract customers or clients think that smoking should be thinking to find a place to smoke, but customers should not smoke in a restaurant because smoking is dangerous. It is hard to find reasons why restaurants should allow people to smoke. It is bad for them and other people. It may good for the owner to earn a lot of money because many customers like to smoke. But it is very bad idea to do because you are making people destroy their heaths as the same destroy of other.
