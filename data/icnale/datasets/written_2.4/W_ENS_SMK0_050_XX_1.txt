As you might have guessed from my other response, my mother is very protective of me, so smoking has always been a taboo subject in my household. One time I even just had a stupid Marlboro hat, and she was mad at me for a long time simply for having something that was related to cigarettes. I think that there are just as many Japanese moms out there who are very protective like my own, and they hate to see the fact that smoking is allowed in restaurants because they know how bad it is for their children. Also, they do not want their children to get involved in an activity that might lead to worse things such as drinking and gambling or even hard drugs. Although I do not appreciate my mother is strict control of me, I realize that she has my best interests in mind, and if the Japanese mothers have the best interests of their children in mind as well, they should seek to make this a more discussed issue so that they can ban smoking in the restaurants very soon. I hope that if I am never lucky enough to go to Japan that I did not have to worry about whether are not the restaurants are smoky.
