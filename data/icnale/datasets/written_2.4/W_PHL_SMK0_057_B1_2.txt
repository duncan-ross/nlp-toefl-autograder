Smoking ban in public restaurants should be implemented for the betterment of our environment as well as the people living in it. As we all know, smoking is not beneficial in any sense. Smokers may acquire lung and heart diseases that, of course, will cause harm to their health. And also, second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure causes lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in innocent non-smoking adults and children. Banning smoking will eradicate the major cause of respiratory diseases. Smoking also contributes to the air pollution in public places that makes our environment unclean. Banning smoking will contribute to the improvement of our environment's cleanliness in the sense that it will lessen air pollution caused by smoking. Smoking, nowadays, is considered as a major vice, wherein majority of the users are teenagers. It is obvious that they are still not in the right age to engage in this kind of activity and parents are highly not in favor with it. Banning smoking will help lessen the increasing number of smokers, particularly the teenagers. A ban would discourage smokers to smoke. If smoking will be banned in public places, particularly in restaurants, it will no longer be a social activity. If smoking will be a less social activity, fewer people will start smoking.
