In recent years, more and more college students in our country prefer to have a part-time job. Still the quality is increasing. However, is it important for them to have a part-time job? I think so. On the one hand, most college students are adults now, so it is the right time for them to have a part-time job besides their study. They should behave like other adults to raise themselves rather than asking their parents for a lot of money. Through the part-time job, they can get a lot of experience and their ability will be better. Nowadays, most companies prefer to give an interview to choose the able one, instead of offering training afterward. It is safe to say that a person whose ability is better is easier to find a job in the future. On the other hand, students who take a part-time job will be better to understand the society. They will meet a lot of people, doing a lot of things like other adults and so on. From doing these things, college students' minds will be changed. They can get readier than others before they actually enter the society. In conclusion, for our college students, having a part-time job is important.
