I agree because it is more important to safeguard Japanese people's health rather than to protect businesses. Without a doubt, smoking causes many health problems which have proven to be the case time and again. Restaurants should adapt to a ban without protest, because in the long run, they will be better off. For example, after a ban was implemented in New South Wales, Australia, only a small percentage of restaurants reported a decrease in trade. In locations where the bans have been introduced, there have been very few problems encountered. Hefty penalties put many businesses off the idea of allowing people to smoke and gradually, it has come to be accepted as'the norm'. The difficulties in implementing similar bans in Japan would include, but not be limited to, the policing of a restaurant ban. It would be extremely difficult to monitor all small restaurants tucked away in the back streets of many small suburbs. Therefore, the government would be relying mostly on the honour system where the onus would be upon the restaurant owner to enforce such a ban. While it may be possible for the police or some type of smoke inspector to make sporadic spot checks, it is doubtful that they would be able to cover every area on a regular basis.
