Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in this country for the following three reasons. First, restaurants are places where people eat food, and the disgusting smells of cigarettes hinder the proper taste and smell of the food served at the restaurants. The smell does not even disappear quickly no matter how much ventilation is provided. Second, secondhand smoking is very harmful to everyone's health. No one has the right to harm other people's health. Smoking in public places is an extremely selfish act, and it should rightfully banned by the law. It is ironic that even those who smoke do not want to smell the smoke from other people. Recent studies say that people who die from secondhand smoking reaches up to about 60 million people throughout the world. Third, restaurants are places for families. A lot of children come to these places to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants not only harms these children, but it also gives negative effect for their education. Children, who see people violating other people's rights from their childhood, have higher chances to do exactly the same thing when they grow up. Restaurants can be places where even the families with infants can come.
