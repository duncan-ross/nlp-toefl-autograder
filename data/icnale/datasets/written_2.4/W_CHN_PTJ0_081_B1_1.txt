More and more students have a part-time job nowadays. Their reasons are different. Most of them take the job as a way to earn their living expenses, while the rest of them just want to practice their abilities and to broad their horizon. On the one hand, I don't think that it is essential for college student to get a part-time job. One year before I took my first part-time job as a saleswoman, I found it really boring after I cooked noodle for 3 days. It really hit me so much; as a result, I think I will never eat instant noodles. As we are too young to take the professional task, we always play the unimportant roles. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the part-time job can exercise one's character. During the working hours, there may be many challenges for you. When you feel failed, when you get tired, and so on, it's high time to challenge yourself and to prove yourself. As every coin has two sides, taking part-time job is a good way to feel the reality and the society. You'd better try for one time. But you face with a tradeoff. We always say the words Opportunity Cost, which means when you choose something, at the same time you need to give up something. If you want more money and more experience, your studying time is being taken the place. It all depends to you. From my viewpoint, it is important for college students to have a part-time job even for just one time. But it is not essential. You have to count the cost, and then to make a decision. And making the fullest of your part time, balancing the percent of job and study also make sense.
