Should Cigarette Smoking Be Banned in All Restaurants in the Country? Untidy and unhealthy environment and smoke screens are some of the problems someone might encounter when he goes in public places. Does anyone like to smell the strong cigarette smoke at public places such as restaurants? Doesn't anyone want to breathe clean air, free of smoke and pollution? Cigarette smoking not only affects the smoker but also the others around the smoker. I totally agree that the smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the Philippines because cigarette smoking poses a great threat to everyone's health. Anyone who is going to eat in a restaurant with his friends wants to feel comfortable in a place where he is sitting. However, it isn t only about atmosphere, which is made by music and people, but there should be fresh air as well. Breathing smoke feels uncomfortable. It's really good to eat and hang out in a smoke free environment. No cigarette can taste as good as it feels to be fit, healthy and active. Prohibiting smoking in public places such as restaurants provides a healthy environment for non-smokers and children. Though smoking ban in all restaurants in the country restricts smokers ' freedom, I believe that the Government has made an excellent choice. Banning smoking in all restaurants may seem like a drastic decision; however, personally I believe that it is in the interests of public health that smoking be banned in public places. It really would be great to have this implemented so that our health can be improved as well.
