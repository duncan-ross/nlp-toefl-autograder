It's really important for college students to have a part-time job because you can learn a lot that you cannot learn before. When I became a college student, I couldn't help but think that it seems everyone who has a part-time job. I was wondering that why so many student work in part-time job until I got one for myself. It's a job working in a restaurant. It's not an easy job because it's busy and tired. I was thinking that should I quit the job? I'm happy I didn't. After the first month, I got my first pay. It isn't so much but it's enough for me and its value is more than how much it is. It means that I can do it and I can live by myself without my parents. It's awesome! The other thing I learn is about this society. This world is not look as wonderful as we think. You have to work hard for yourself and strive for things you want. There's no free lunch for who don't want to work. So I think it's really important to get a part-time job in college life. It's time for college students to learn by themselves instead of teachers.
