I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for health, both for the one who smoke and the ones who smell the smokes. In my opinion, the method to ban smoking at restaurants have two necessaries. First, the restaurants are public places for every one. Smokers smoke in these places are behaviors that "put their happiness upon other's bitterness". The smell is disgusting for the ones who don't smoke and even worse, the smoke will also be harmful to their health. That's not fair for others to pay for your own addiction. The other one is that the method will help smokers get rid of the bad habits. Of course, it will help smokers control themselves and it will be more effective than they do it by themselves. Maybe, there will be some one coming out to say that the practice is discrimination to the smokers and if these people cannot control themselves at that time what will they do. I think there will be many ways to forbid the situation happening. For example, we can arrange a special room for them to smoke or we can even produce another thing to replace the cigarettes.
