Smoking is one of the hobbies of many people. They said smoking can forget their problems. But for me its not. They also said that if you smoke you are being social. Smoking is not good in our health. It can harm our internal organs such as heart and lungs. For me it is only for fun and hobby. The statement smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, I agree. Because first of all restaurants is a place that we eat our food. We know that it is a public place. But if you smoke there, the smoke that came from the cigarette will harm the food and people around you. For example in a restaurant. My friend is eating in a simple restaurant. The man who sited beside her smoke. While she is eating she felt that there is something smells bad. Then she found out that the guy is smoking. She called the attention of the manager of the restaurant and told to him that they must banned cigarette smoking because some of its toxins may come to the food that we eat. We can be sick because of that. Most of the restaurants are in air conditioned, so if someone will smoke, the customers who are eating there can suffocate.
