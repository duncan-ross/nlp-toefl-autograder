The college students should not only study but also work a part time job in the same time. Because the students do a part time job will get a lot of experiences from working. When the students work in the real job they can use the knowledge to the work. They can get some good advice from the boss and friends working in the same place. If they do some wrong work, they can ask the boss how to work properly. They receive the money and they can use these money to buy the thing whatever they want like the cosmetics, fashion bag, shoes, dresses, and mobile phone. College students who don't have money have to find part time job. They will know how hard when they parents work for the money to support them. They will not use the money to buy a very expensive thing. The government should help the college students to find the good job and protect them from selfish boss. The teacher should suggest a good and safe place for students to work. If students have problem they can talk with teacher and parents.
