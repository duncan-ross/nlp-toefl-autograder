 You can see many people smoking at everywhere, on the road, in the subway, and in the restaurants. I think smoking should be banned at public place, especially at all the restaurant. In the first place, restaurants is public place, and there are many people stay in a almost closed place, which cause the air in the restaurant isn't very fresh. Moreover, Somking will make this condition even worse. Everyone knows the harmfulness of the second-hand smoking, especially to the pregnant woman, so I against smoking in the restaurant firmly. Secondly, smoking is a kind of addiction, if someone pick out a cigarette and want smoke, someone else who see this can't help smoking. And it's very normal when a person want to smoking, he will invite others smoke with him. People around then will feel being disturbed when they are making smoke. In my opinion, government and the restaurants should associate to ban the people who smoke in the restaurant. They can make a signal in the noticed place, and smoking person can go to someplace private, like washroom. In a word, smoking isn't a good hobby, and I think it's really a disturbing thing when a person smoking in the restaurant. So I think it's really necessary to ban smoking in the restaurant.
