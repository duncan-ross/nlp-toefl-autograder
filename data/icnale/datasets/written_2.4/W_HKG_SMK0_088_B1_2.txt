It is obvious to everyone that smoking is not healthy and can bring nothing good to us. Only horrible disease such as lung cancer can it bring to us. Some may think that the unhealthiness caused by smoking is personal. It is naive, if not ridiculous. The second-hand smoke can also cause respiratory disease to other people around. Restaurant is a suitable place for illustrating this phenomenon. I strongly agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. In the view point of consumer, especially for the non-smokers, they may feel annoying that some disgusting smell and smoke is floating around them while they are enjoying the tea. There will be no chance for them to go that restaurant again. For restaurant, profit from those non-smokers will be lost if smoking is allowed. It is true that some smokers may refuse to go to smoking-banned restaurant. As far as I am concerned, smokers may not be bothered to smoke outside restaurant but those non-smokers must care about it. All in all, not banning smoking in restaurant is a kind of encouraging behavior that is not supposed to be supported in this healthy society.
