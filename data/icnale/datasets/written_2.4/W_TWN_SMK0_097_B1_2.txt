In my opinion, I think smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. From the aspect of health, there is no good to our body. From the aspect of hygiene, it's dirty in the surrounding to have smoke drifting in the air. On the other hand, smoking can hurt not only our self but other's health. The small dot of the dust will cause lung disease and finally kill the person. It's very horrible. The research has show that cigarettes are made of harmful plants. It's illegal to plant it. But many people would rather take the risky to plant the toxic plant. Because it can makes lots of profits. Though it is the right for everyone to do what they like. But we can not disturb the others freedom to establish on our own will. It's selfish and we should respect other people's right. Not in the restaurant but all public places should completely banned smoking. In recent years, more and more people are aware of the importance of health. They begin to establish groups or organizations to help people against the addicted to the smoke as well as the people who are the victims of the lung cancer. Most important of all, we should insist that the person who craving for tobacco can not smoke in the public places. And make strict laws to punish those who unwilling to obey the standards.
