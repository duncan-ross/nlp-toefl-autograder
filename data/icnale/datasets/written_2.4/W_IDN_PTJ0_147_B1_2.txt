It is very important for college students to have a part time job in another country if they are study overseas. Because in the foreign country, the student who studies in the college must have an experienced and want to earn some money to meet their requirement for their daily need. Another reason is the students who have a part time job is understand how hard to earn a money. Usually the students spend their money to buy something that useless for their daily need; they buy for their prestige only not for their requirement. Another reason is not everyone in this world are rich people. If your parents are a very rich people, I think you shouldn't work part time because your parent can give all of your daily need. But if your parents have a little bit finance problems I think you must have a part time job to reduce the payment for your College cost and your cost for daily needs. I think it is depend in the college student situation because if you study overseas the living cost and your daily needs are very expensive. But if you study in Indonesia I think you shouldn't have a part time job because the salary is very cheap and can't meet your daily need.
