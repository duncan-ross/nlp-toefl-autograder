There is a common consensus that smoking is bad for health as it leads to many diseases such as lung or throat cancer. In addition, smoking also leads to second-hand smoke that affects non-smokers as well in the form of passive smoking which lead to similar health problems. As such, it may be understandable to ban smoking in all restaurants. However, this might cause a drop in customers for the restaurants as they might choose alternatives like hawker centres or taking out and eating in a place where they are allowed to smoke. Also, smoking is a lifestyle choice and people should be given the option to smoke or not, without so many legal restrictions. In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned within the indoor seating of the restaurant as it causes the second-hand smoke to diffuse and remain within the air circulation. As such, if the restaurant is able to maintain an outdoor smoking seating area, which is isolated in a manner that little or no second-hand smoke can reach the indoor or outdoor non-smoking areas, smoking need not be completely banned from all restaurants. This will give flexibility to customers who may be heavy or social smokers.
