Basically I am agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I will show you some reasons to back up my point of view. First of all, we college students are no more those little kids who can not distinguish the bad from the good in society or even can not care for themselves well. We just can't live our life with our parents protection and care forever. So it is the part-time job that really gives us an opportunity to show our talent and burden responsibilities. Secondly, through the process of doing a part-time job, not only can we learn how to deal with various people from the different parts of world but also we can understand the complex society more specifically and sharply rather than read all those meaningless books in school. A part-time job can strengthen us greatly and then equip us with more practical knowledge to step into the world. Thirdly, we college students usually have more free time compared with the high school students so working outside will not affect our study greatly as long as we arrange our schedule appropriately. Lastly, we are already 18 years old and it's high time that we became less dependent of our parents and made some money to give them a little relief. Put the four pieces together, we can come to the conclusion that having a part-time job is of great importance and benefit to the college students.
