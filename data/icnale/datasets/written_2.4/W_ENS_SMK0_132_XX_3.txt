I definitely think so! Most of the world is finally waking up to this, but in Japan, which is second only to South Korea in being the country with the largest amount of heavy smokers, they are behind the times I'm afraid to say. If you go to many restaurants in Japan, both large and small, the only thing separating the smokers from the non-smokers is either a small, ineffective partition or they are seated next door to each other, side by side. Japan is well known for being a smoker's paradise and the proof is plain to see. The protection for non-smokers against inhaling secondary smoke in most restaurants is non existent at worst and totally useless at best, as far as I have seen. It is astounding to note that the Japanese Government has yet to catch up with the rest of the world in this regard. Considering that Japan is widely renowned as the technology leaders of the world and is fully aware of the numerous health issues and risks for both smokers and those that inhale secondary smoke, it is incredulous to me that the Government has yet to issue a blanket ban across Japan making it mandatory for all restaurants to comply.
