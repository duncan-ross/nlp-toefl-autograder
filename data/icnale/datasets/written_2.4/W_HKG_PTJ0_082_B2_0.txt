As far as I am concerned, it is very important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons why I argue are as follow. In the first place, you can apply the knowledge you learnt in the classroom to practice if you have a part-time job. Secondly, it will be a good chance for you to improve your soft skills, such as communication skills and time management skills, when you do the part time job. This can, in return, enhance your study back at school. Absolutely, this will benefit you a lot when you really find a job after graduation. Besides, you can earn the allowance from the job, which will lighten the financial burden from your parents who support your study. What is more, gaining working experience while studying in university, you may find jobs after graduation more easily. Some people may disagree that they believe having part time jobs will result in worse academic performance at school. I think, however, this is not the case. Multi-tasking is what we definitely will encounter when we join the society after graduation. Instead of escaping from the challenge, it is better for us to practice as soon as possible.
