Today we are living in 21st century for which an 18th or 19th century man had just wondered that it would be the perfect time to live in with every type of facility. Now living in 21st century we can see that his dream was true but partially because today every type of modern facility is available in market but far away from the range of a middle class person because the living expenditures are touching the heights of skies and it is being more and more hard to survive for lower class people to survive with these circumstances. As the consequence of this situation it is not possible for an ordinary man to educate his children up to metric level and to fulfill his desires of better future so the students are themselves compelled to do part time jobs to continue their studies smoothly. On the other hand students who do part time jobs along with their studies become more punctual and hardworking then their other class mates and these habits lead them to be gentle in their upcoming professional lives. So the conclusion is that 'yes' part time job is necessary for college students but this statement should not be taken as negative because it also affects good on one's future life.
