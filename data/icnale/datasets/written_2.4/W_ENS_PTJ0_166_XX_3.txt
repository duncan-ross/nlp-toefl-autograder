Having been employed with a part-time job myself while at college, I truly believe that it is an awesome idea for students to have part-time jobs before they graduate from college, if they have the time to do so. Students who learn responsibility, have nothing to lose and everything to gain by having a job. I know that a student who can keep a part-time job while studying, will gain excellent first-hand experience that cannot always be gained form a college campus. These days, if you are looking for part-time jobs online, you will find many of them are targeting students, partly because the positions are part-time only and partly because students provide cheap labour. The employer wins and the student wins too. Usually, students with experience on their resume are more readily employable because they can show that they have already proven that they can handle a job while balancing college as well. If students are finding it difficult to get a paying job that fits in with their schedule, then they might consider doing volunteer work. There is always plenty of that going around and future employers will still take that into consideration when reviewing job resumes and keep the student in mind.
