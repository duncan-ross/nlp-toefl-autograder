 In my opinion, I hold the belief that every college student should try to do part-time job if possible. I have these strong enough reasons to support this view. First, what college student can learn from by dong part-time job is that they can get the experiences of working. As everybody knows, the situation of finding a job is so hard in the present. So, the experiences of working for a fresh graduate is so valuable. Second, doing a part-time job also means meeting more people and you will make many new friends. Then, your life will become more funny and happier. Third, when doing a part-time job you may get your characters changed. You may become more out-going and talking while you were shy and even never dared speaking in public. In the last, or the most important point for someone, doing a part-time job can make money to do what you want to. For example, my friend who is working for library every weekend use his money which he get from working to have bought a series of stamps that he is always wanting to collect. So, there are so many benefits to do a part-time job for college student. Let's start to find a part-time job!
