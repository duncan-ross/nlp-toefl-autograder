Restaurant is a public place. Smoking in the public place is not a polite behavior. Imaging the restaurant is not in the open air. if the smoke is created, it must be a long time when the air become clean again. Eating in the smoke is not a happy thing at least for me. When we get into the restaurants, we must enjoy meals. We go to restaurants for meals, it's a special time. As we know, the second-hand smoke is harmful to people. Smoking in the public place is to do the things that harm others. Those people who smoke in public should be punished. In another way, smoking is bad for the smokers himself. The nicotine which is in the smoke would make smoker's lung get dark and even worst would lead cancer. The health is the basis of everything. Sacrificing the health for smoking is not wise decision. In a word, smoking in the restaurant is not only bad for others, but also for smoker himself, so I think smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants.
