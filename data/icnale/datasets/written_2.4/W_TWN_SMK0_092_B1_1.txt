From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, the most important reason is about health. When it comes to smoking, bad health comes on mind. Smoking is not only bad for the smokers' health but also their parents and friends. It is reported that people who smoke get lung cancer easily; moreover, their teeth will also become worse. As soon as you smoke, the chance that you get cancer will be bigger. On the other hand, it is about hygiene. When we choose a good restaurant, the most important part is its hygiene. We don't want to taste delicious food while there is smell of cigarette. However, some of the elders used to smoke while they are discuss about business. In recent years, the government has enacted the law that people should not smoke when they are in public place. Therefore, we don't see people smoking in restaurant right now. In the past decades, the government raises the price of the cigarette, and they advocate the bad effect of smoking. All in all, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Due to the health and hygiene, they are main effects caused by the smoking.
