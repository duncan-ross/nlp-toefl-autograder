I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking is not really good for health. It damages the health of whose smoking it, and it's a great cause of canner. It leads to be dead if who smoke it a lot and for long time. It is not good for others who near them too, they might get the smoke. Next, I think smoking in the public such as in the restaurants is not good and it is a bad behavior because it is not a good thing to do in public. Maybe parents bring their kids to have breakfast, lunch or dinner at the restaurants. They might see adults are smoking and someday they might imitate when their parents away home or maybe they will do it in school with friends. That is not a good behavior to do in front of children. Finally, smoking is caused to lost a lot of money that they might not know. People who are smoking it have to spend money to buy it. Even it isn't cast too much but if take it for long time its can be a lot by nonsense things. Therefore, I think it's a good idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and also everywhere in the country.
