Smoking is an archaic and somewhat outdated habit, but it has a long tradition and it has become quite the big business in many countries of the world. I can only assume that Japanese tobacco companies are as successful in prolific as their American counterparts, and as such, I think that if smoking has taken any kind of a foothold in Japanese culture and in Japanese restaurants, it'll be very difficult to dislodge it from this position. However, for the sake and for the health of the people, I recommend that Japan reconsider their allowing the restaurants to permit smoking. In my opinion, smokers should be free to smoke if they choose to do so, but they should not allow this choice to have an impact upon people who they do not even know. Accordingly, it would make sense to designate special areas reserved for smokers in both restaurants and other public places so that they can enjoy their habit and live their lives as they please without causing a nuisance for others. The method of separating restaurants into smoking and nonsmoking areas has been in wide practice in the US for a number of years, and if it is not already taken advantage of in Japan as well, it may be a good first step toward addressing this problem more fully.
