I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First smoking does not have to ban at all the restaurant. Because some restaurant's customer may smoke. If all the restaurants completely ban smoking, the restaurant may loss the customer. But I think restaurant entertains with taste and service. So if someone smokes at the restaurant, restaurant's atmosphere is broken. For example I dislike smoke. Because many smoker has bad manner. If these people come to the restaurant, non smoke customer thinks we never go to this restaurant. Second smoking is bad for children. Therefore a family who has a child may not go to the restaurant because of smoking. If you want to smoke in the restaurant, you had better go to a bar. You can enjoy drinking and smoking. So I think a bar is very happy place for smoker. Finally smoking is caused do harm to not only smoker but also non smoker. So smoking should be banned not only restaurant but also any other place. For example university, station and street. Or cigarette should be more expensive than now. I think decreasing smoker is best. This is why I agree with this situation.
