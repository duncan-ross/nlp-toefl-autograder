I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As everyone knows, smoking harms the body, leading to lung cancer. Actually, second-hand smoke will lead the same bad influence or even much severely. I think everybody should know the badnesses which had proved of second-hand smoke's influence, specifically those who like to smoke in public places. For example, first, the developing lungs of young children are also affected by exposure to secondhand smoke. Second, Short-term exposure to tobacco smoke also has a measurable effect on the heart in non-smokers. Just 30 minutes exposure is enough to reduce coronary blood flow. Third, some of the immediate effects of passive smoking include eye irritation, headache, cough, sore throat, dizziness and nausea. Terribly, second-hand smoke can cause lung cancer on nonsmokers. In order to protect heath of people, we can ask in advance about smoking policies and let all hotels, tours, ships, rental car agencies, etc. know your preferences. Always take the smoke-free options that are available. Otherwise, ask to be seated in non-smoking areas as far from smokers as possible when dining out. Honestly, I think the best way to protect people is formulating laws. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
