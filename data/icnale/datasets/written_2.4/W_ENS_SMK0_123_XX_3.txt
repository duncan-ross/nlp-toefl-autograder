Smoking is one of those human activities that, in a way different from alcohol, has the potential to do considerable harm to others. It is also a big nuisance to people who do not smoke. Compared to drinking alcohol, another activity whose regulation has demanded countless hours of legislators' time, smoking is a "harmless" activity, at least in the sense that smoking a cigarette or three does not lead to an increased risk having a traffic accident. Yet the well-documented negative effects of second-hand smoke can pose serious health risks over a prolonged period of time to even completely healthy people, not to mention people who have respiratory conditions such as asthma. While there are few situations where a non-smoker must be nearby someone is smoking, the restaurant is probably the most common. In a closed space with poor ventilation, which describes most restaurants, second-hand smoke has a way of spreading throughout the entire place. This is often true even when a restaurant has designated-smoking areas. The big problem here is the fact that, while there are places to have a smoke outside of restaurants, there are few places other than restaurants where one can sit down, relax and have a bite to eat, other than of course one's home. For people whom cigarette smoke dulls the flavor of their food or aggravates their allergies, eating at a restaurant where smoking is allowed becomes something unenjoyable, and may cause them to not ever come back. This is why many restaurant owners do not need to fear any lost business: while they may lose customers who are smokers, they will gain new customers who prefer a smoke-free environment. Restaurants owners will also not have to replace their yellowed wallpaper every year, worry about supplying and emptying out ashtrays, and make more efficient use of the space in their restaurant thanks to being able to allocate all of it to non-smoking.
