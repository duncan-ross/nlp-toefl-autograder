Money is need of time. Particularly in Pakistan poverty is increasing day by day, hence it is the need of hour for everyone to earn wealth. Part time job is one of the better ways to earn. It is the nature of job which some one starts as a side job or as a minor work apart from his/her routine work in free time. No doubt it is very tough to manage your routine work with part time job but genius or needy people do it efficiently. It has many benefits as wall as draw backs. It is beneficial as it increases one's salary and skill, hence awareness also. It is one of the best ways to make your time valuable instead of sitting at leisure. On the other hand it is not student friendly because it is tough for students to manage their studies in most cases. Sometimes one can not give accurate time to friends and family. So due to the frantic routine one has no time to relax his/her body and mind as well. Part time jobs in our society mostly include home tuitions, maids (in case of females) or serving at a store as a salesman. By all that we can say that as other things part time job has both faces-------- gloomy and dazzling.
