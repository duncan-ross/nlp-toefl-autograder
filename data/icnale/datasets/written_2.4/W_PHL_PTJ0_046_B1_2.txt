Part time job is a job that really helps many people especially students who can't afford to pay their tuition fee. Part time job has a big help now a days, mostly to the college students. For me it is very important to college students to have a part time job. It has many advantages that can help college students, example of these are, they can be trained being a disciplined person by managing their time as a student and as a worker. These students can work in day time and during the night they can attend to their school or vice versa. Having a part time job can train the students how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. They will learn how to save and think how important money is. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Another thing is that having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help us find our ideal job more easily in the future. And we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance.
