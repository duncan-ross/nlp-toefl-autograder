Part time jobs are jobs that require fewer hours per week by a person as compared to a full time job. There are many reasons to take up a part time job, but the primary reason is due to lack of money. Some people, such as students or senior citizens, aim for part time jobs for their primary source of earning; others use this means as a secondary source of income, often when their first job pay is not enough for their sustenance or contemptment. Some of the typical part time jobs include working in a restaurant, a retail store, a call center, a public library, a university, or a factory. The largest group of part time job workers are students, most aged between seventeen and twenty-three. This may be to pay for educational expenses or simply to earn more pocket money. Again, part time jobs may vary reasons and causes. Other individuals take up part time jobs because doing that particular kind of work is where their true passion may lay, but think that this particular activity cannot support their means of living. It also does not include many benefits as compared to a full time job. There are usually no health insurances, stock options, or even financial incentives.
