In our daily life, we can't ignore the bare fact that smoking exists in most restaurants, which has become a heating problem. Different citizens have different attitudes towards the phenomenon, however, as we can see, some restaurants have taken actions according to smoking. As far as I am concerned, smoking is bound to be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. To begin with, smoking is not socially acceptable, which affects both yourself and others. As a citizen, we need to shoulder our shared responsibility in the society and learn to be self-disciplined. Smokers shouldn't damage others' health in order to enjoy themselves. What's more, smoking at restaurants is immoral although the law hadn't made nay punishment for smoking. There is no denying that smokers have their freedom to do it. But choice encourages both freedom and responsibility, so as adults, smokers must learn to handle both wisely. Most often, I have the burning desire to arouse the public awareness of smoking, with the development of modernization and civilization of our society, the quality of people' living standard needs to be improved correspondingly. If smoking can be completely banned at restaurants, the whole society can develop more prosperously, peacefully and harmoniously.
