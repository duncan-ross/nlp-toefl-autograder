I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons for this. First, restaurants are the place not only to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner, but also to take rest. In order to rest, some people eat and chat, other people smoke. Smoking is a kind of rest for smoking people. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, they will lose one of their places to rest. Second, I think we don't need to ban smoking completely. Nowadays almost all seats in restaurants are divided into smoking seat and non-smoking seat. I propose to increase the number of non-smoking seat, in order for non-smoking people to be comfortable, or to isolate smoking seat from non-smoking seat by making walls made by glass. For these reasons, I don't agree to ban smoking at restaurants completely, in spite that I don't smoke. Smoking decreases our health, I know, but from the side of smoking people, smoking is a part of his life, so it is almost impossible to inhibit smoking people to smoke. Of course we need to separate smoking seat and non-smoking seat strictly
