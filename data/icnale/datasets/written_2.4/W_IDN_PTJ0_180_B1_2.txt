Nowadays, there are many university or college students who has part time during their study, because they should pay hundreds or thousands dollars for their college fees, and sometimes they spend the rest of their earnings for their food or gas fee. It is good for them because they can start to familiarize themselves with actual working atmospheres, but actually having part time job is not very good for them. They should go for work after their lessons, and they have no more time to do their assignments. Part time job, especially in the evening, also makes students easily got fatigue, because it decreases their rest time, and makes them tired and sleepy at the campus in the next morning, especially for the students who often have their study in front of computer. Part time job also distracts our studying routines and makes us difficult to manage our time. Sometimes students cannot decide which one is more important and should be preceded, studying at the campus or working. In my opinion, it is not important for us to be too fast to start working, because we can get working experience during projects period that is provided by our university or college.
