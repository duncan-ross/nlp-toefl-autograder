If students need a job, then it is important. If they do not need the money, then it is not. This is specifically related to individual requirements and is not something that can be generalized into a one size fits all categories. While there are advantages and disadvantages in working part-time at university or college, this can only be decided by the student and what best fits their personal circumstances. Other factors to consider are the student's mental health and general well being because these will certainly be affected by increasing the student's workload and placing additional pressures on them. Under normal circumstances, most students seem quite capable of adapting to the additional responsibilities that come with a part-time job and are able to organise their schedules to a level that they feel comfortable with. There will be a few students however, who are incapable of dealing with these additions in a functional manner, until they acquire the skills to do so and can apply them in a way that seems less overwhelming to them and which allows them to function at the required levels. Universities and colleges need to be aware of these and have appropriate guidance from qualified counsellors freely available and easily assessable to students.
