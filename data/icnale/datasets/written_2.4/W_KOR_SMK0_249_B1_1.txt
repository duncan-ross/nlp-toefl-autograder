Also, smoking makes ashes. Although most of smokers use ashtrays, it does not solve the problems. Rather than solving, ashtrays can be also another problem to clean. Secondly, smoking is bad behavior to health. Many smokers are charging this risk to enjoy their little time, but other non smokers are not.
