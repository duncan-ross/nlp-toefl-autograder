Nowadays, more and more college students are busying in finding part time jobs. When it comes to the question whether students should find part time to do, the opinions vary from person to person. In my opinion, I think that it is a good idea to find a part time job to do in one's spare time. First of all, part time jobs can provide students with some valuable working experience. The working experience may help students to find jobs easier after they graduate. There is no denying that finding good jobs is becoming more and more difficult for the graduates. If students can have some working experience, the possibility of they being employed will be higher. Besides, doing part time jobs can help students know how to communicate with people correctly. When a student is doing a part time job, he has to talk with many different kinds of people, even someone who is hard to deal with. They will learn how to deal with people with different character. That's good for their future life. Last but not least, doing part time jobs can earn some money, which may release some part of parents' pressure. Though the money may not be too much, we still can do something with it. For example, we can buy some small gifts for our parents. But one thing we cannot forget is that our study shouldn't be bothered by doing part time jobs. Learning knowledge is the most important thing for the students. To conclude, if one has a lot of spare time, doing a part time job may be a good idea. He can be profited a lot from it!
