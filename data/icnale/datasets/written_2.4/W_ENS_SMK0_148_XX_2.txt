I don't feel that it should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. Where would the smokers go? I don't smoke myself but some of my friends do and it would be pretty tough for them to sit at a restaurant for a couple of hours without having a cigarette. I don't like being in smoke filled rooms so when I go out with them, we always try to pick a diner or restaurant that has plenty of space and good fans. I do know about the dangers of smoking and also breathing in second-hand hand smoke, but I think that it is OK if there is plenty of ventilation. Legally, I don't know if Japan can do that anyway or if they would want to because there are so many smokers in Japan who would probably complain and do a protest march on their local city office. Business owners can make their own choice on whether they want to ban it or not and their customers can decide if they want to go to a smoking restaurant or not. I think that we have to be careful about letting our governments have to much control over everything that we do. I am not a conspiracy theory believer but I wouldn't feel comfortable and would probably think that I was in the military being ordered around if governments decide everything for us in our personal lives as well.
