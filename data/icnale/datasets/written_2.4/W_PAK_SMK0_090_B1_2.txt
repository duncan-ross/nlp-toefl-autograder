From our childhood, we grown up listening to one particular sentence, Smoking is injurious to health. So from the beginning we have bad image of people who used to smoke. As we grow elder this image changes. I will tell you later why this image changes. Everyday 3, 000 children start smoking, most them between the ages of 10 and 18. These kids account for 90 percent of all new smokers. In fact, 90 percent of all adult smokers said that they first started smoking as teenagers. These statistics clearly show that young people are the prime target in the tobacco wars. Reason why teenagers are attracted to smoking and why my image of smokers changed is same. Media is prime cause of that thing. Smokers are pictured in a heroic way in the media. We see in movies and commercials that smokers are like super heroes that can do anything. But reality is very much opposite. Tobacco smoke contains about 4, 000 chemicals, including 200 known poisons. Smokers can develop diseases such as lung cancer and heart diseases. Smoke has an especially bad effect on infants and children whose parents smoke. Once in life everyone will agree to one thing that is Smoking is injurious to health.
