I agree the smoking should be banned because smoking is one of the worst things. Kids or adults smoking and tobacco use can cause cancer, lung and heart disease. And risks to an unborn child if the mother smokes. And smoking affects the environment and health damage. Smokers should be aware the dangers of smoking tobacco for good health and who do as their own. In statement, in all restaurants should ban smoking, it's good idea to do but sometimes it may hard to stop the smokers. If we warn them, they are angry and may hurt us. We have to let them do it. Who smoke, their health will be bad. But if we can stop them to smoke in the restaurant, everyone will be safe. Because people they don't smoke and don't get the smoke from tobacco. If smoker want to smoke, the restaurant have to tell them to go outside, go the park, or somewhere that people can't smell it. Tobacco is very popular in teenagers, and office workers. They like to smoke everywhere. I am okay but I don't like when I am in air condition room or a taxi and I smell the tobacco. Air is not fresh and hard to breath. If we can stop smoker in everywhere, we all will save from cancer from tobacco.
