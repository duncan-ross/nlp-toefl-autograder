Whilst the harmful effects of smoking on the health of both smokers and non-smokers are widely recognised, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants countrywide would be too extreme a measure. It is more appropriate to phase out smoking and help smokers to quit before banning smoking at all restaurants. Smoking is addictive and smokers can find it difficult to quit smoking even when it is banned. More help should be given to smokers such as recommending them to anti-smoking centres and alternatives like nicotine patches or electronic cigarettes that help them resist the addiction. Public awareness should be raised and economic incentives to quit smoking should be put in place to create an overall environment that discourages smoking instead of outright banning it. A smoking ban is merely a piece of legislation that is a symptomatic measure and does not solve the real problem. Smoking has been banned in schools and air-conditioned places, bus stops and lifts. However, many smokers still flout these regulations and even now, bus stops and lifts are still not smoke-free. The authorities, however, do not have the manpower and resources to monitor the situation and this poor enforcement limits the effectiveness of smoking bans in these places. Similarly, a ban on smoking in restaurants may have limited effectiveness and instead, smoking should be discouraged through other measures that give actual support to smokers trying to quit.
