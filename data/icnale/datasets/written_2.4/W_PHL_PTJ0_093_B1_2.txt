Though having a part time job would seem to be a practical choice financially speaking for college students, there are still many factors to consider. Times nowadays are rough; there are more expenses to cover even with very little salary that averahe people earn. As college students, we basically rely upon our parents ' earning to provide for our needs, however we can't deny the fact that most often than not, the money just isn't enough. so on the question whether I approve of working students or not? To tell the truth, I happen to not advice the youth like myself to be working students. Not only are the work-load of school heavy enough on their own, adding even more physical duties wouldn't help at all. By trying to multi-task, we might not produce as good of an output if we choose to only do one at a time. It would be more inspiring to study knowing that it is your only focus as of the moment. Another factor to consider is, working and studying at the same time may also put your social life at risk, with these two big tasks accumulating your everyday life, there just wouldn't be enough time for you to mingle with your family and friends. If there's a really big need to provide for your education, there are still some alternative options of earning money such as doing some part time jobs over the weekend or even during summer and long vacations. In the end, it's a matter ofchoice, whether or not you could actually take the challenge of balancing both task with determination and dedication.
