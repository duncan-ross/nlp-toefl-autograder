Smoking is known to be practised by 1/3 of the global adult population, and is a common social norm regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, and nationality. This is despite the numerous ill effects associated with smoking. While it may be difficult to completely ban smoking altogether because of the likely strong resistance from the large number of users as well as the backing of a huge tobacco industry, many countries have been actively taking steps of tax imposition as well as banning smoking in certain public places. As a country's government ought to promote and protect its citizens' interests, the ill effects of smoking ought to be eradicated or at least reduced through legislature, for the greater good of the society. Smoking does not only affect the smoker directly, but indirectly affects other people of immediate vicinity to the smoker. This is especially the case for enclosed spaces like restaurants, where air circulation may be poor. Besides adverse health effects such as potential lung cancer and the shortening of lifespan, smoking is also of bad influence psychologically. On a more macro level, smoking also reduces individual productivity and hence, a country's economic productivity as a whole, since labour is a major factor of production. However, even with the introduction of legislature, there is also another issue of political will towards implementation.
