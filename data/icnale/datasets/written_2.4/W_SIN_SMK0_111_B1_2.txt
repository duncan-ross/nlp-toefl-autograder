As a non-smoker, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smokers are of the minority, and in adopting a utilitarian position, a ban on smoking would benefit the largest group of people. The cost of smoking far outweighs the cost. For one, smokers produce second hand smoke which is harmful to the health of the general public. Without a ban, allowing smokers to smoke in restaurants would only serve to inconvenience non-smokers. In fact, the cost of this would be multiplied when considering the young, elderly, and those with existing health problems. Furthermore, many restaurants are increasingly becoming air conditioned, a setting totally unsuitable for smoke. Even with a designated smoking area, there is the risk that the smoke would enter the air ventilation system of the air conditioning unit. Moreover, the creation of a smoking area would also deny restaurant owners a potential profit making enterprise in the creation of an al fresco dining area. After all, it is not just the smokers who would prefer a non-air conditioned area. Social smokers however, would decry such a move, arguing that it inconveniences them, yet their argument begets the fact that they are inconveniencing others on their first place with their actions. Restaurants may also argue against such a ruling, as many businessmen do smoke, especially those choosing to entertain clients. However, I feel such acts are more likely to be taking place in night clubs or bars rather than in restaurants. As such, I believe that smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants.
