I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Maybe there are some students still be helped by parent's economy support. But in my case, I have a part-time job when I entered university. The payment is not so much but it's enough to offer my life's payment. And I also learned a lot of things from the part-time job. Such as facing very different kinds of people, I believe those experience will become your skill to solve the problem in job of the future. Second, I met some important friend of my life, it's just like a little society but not that complicated as the full job. Develop the great friendship is important and helpful to ourselves. Third, I think it could let student become more independent that students have a part-time job. I earn the money by self, and I think it could learn how to use and separate my salary in my school life, those necessary payment like eating, shopping, playing.... etc. After all, almost college students stayed in the university about four years. If you choose to enter the career and find a job after graduated. I think those part-time job experience will be helpful to you.
