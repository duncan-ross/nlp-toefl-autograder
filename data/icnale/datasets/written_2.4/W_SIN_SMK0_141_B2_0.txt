It is essential to implement bans on smoking in restaurants within the country, but it is not feasible and considerate to ban smoking at all restaurants. Second-hand smoke is detrimental to non-smokers in terms of the human health. Also, many non-smokers exhibit strong dislike towards the smell of the tobacco smoke. As such, it is essential to minimise contact between non-smokers and second-hand smoke to protect the rights of these non-smokers. Bans on smoking in designated public areas with extremely high volume of people can protect non-smokers. Selected restaurants, which are public places, can implement the smoking ban. Though the rights of non-smokers should be considered, the country should not totally neglect the rights of smokers. By totally neglecting the smokers' rights, the state is encouraging to smokers to quit smoking, which can be seen as a move aimed at benefiting smokers' health. However, what rights do the state has in implicitly forcing smokers to subscribe to a belief opposite of theirs? While the state is respecting the non-smokers' rights, it needs to also respect the smokers' rights too. Banning smoking in all restaurants would certainly send a strong signal that the state does not care about the smokers' rights. Thus, the solution is to make certain restaurants smoke-free, while other restaurants allow smokers to smoke in their territories.
