I do not agree that is it important for college students to have a part time job. This question somehow implies that it is necessary for university students to obtain a part time job. Firstly, I would like to point out that this question is rather subjective and perspectives may differ upon context. For college students, getting a part time job is a great way to supplement allowances and gain working experiences during term breaks. However, a student should not feel pressurized to get a job if they have other activities that they would like to pursue within or outside college. For instance, students may find more personal fulfillment in joining student committees or participating in social work and see that as a better use of their student life as compared to getting a part time job. That said, there are also students who work in school as a part timer to coordinate ad hoc events for the faculty. While it is self-explanatory that students experiencing financial constraints would find it important to secure a part time job during school time such as providing tuition services; or working during the term breaks, it is noteworthy that college faculties do provide financial aid for students to alleviate their financial difficulties. As a college student, I believe the time we have in college is extremely short. Personally, I believe in doing activities that encourage self-discovery and personal development. If a student finds fulfillment in his or her part time job, there is no reason why reason he or she should not invest his or her time in working outside of school.
