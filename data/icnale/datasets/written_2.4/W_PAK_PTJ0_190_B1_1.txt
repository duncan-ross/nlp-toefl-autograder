Pakistan is a country full of color and zest, rich in culture. Our culture's foundation lies in the strong family unit. The sort of bonding we promote, family ties we have are scarce in the west. Here we believe in taking care of our kith and kin. Our cultural norm is that parents support their children all through their life. They raise us, educate us, provide for us, arrange our weddings for us, and then pamper our kids as well. In such scenario, I strongly feel that part time jobs are not fit for our culture, neither for our family units, nor for our society. It is western concept that parents must ask their kids to leave the house and live on their own once they turn eighteen. For them and their youngsters it is necessary that that they opt for part time jobs, earn for themselves. It is inevitable for them and vital for their survival as well. On the other hand our culture is a reflection of warmth. Parents take their kids as small chicks and keep them under their wings, safe from the heat and cold of the world, until they feel that chicks are ready to survive on their own. This generally is never. Since our culture does not enforce any such responsibilities, we do not need any part time jobs. We want our kids to give complete attention to their studies before they begin to worry about earning.
