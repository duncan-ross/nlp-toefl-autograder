Ever since I was a little girl my parents have always told me not to smoke. They say that it is a dirty habit that can destroy the lives of otherwise innocent people. Even when we were in grade school they showed us many documentaries about the harmful effects of smoking. One of the documentaries claimed that smokers will spend tens of thousands of dollars on cigarettes throughout their whole lives. Why not save this money and put it on something more constructive and not as negative for your health. The documentaries also showed many photos of smokers' lungs. To be honest, those pictures are some of the most graphic and disgusting things I have ever seen, and many of my friends who had experimented with smoking as teenagers were compelled to stay away from smoking as a result of these films. Obviously, this must mean that these films are effective in discouraging smoking, and maybe they can be used in Japan as well in order to deal with the smoking problem at restaurants. If Colorado can be used as an example, I think that it is only a matter of time until more states and more countries decide to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants.
