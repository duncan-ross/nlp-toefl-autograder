Part time job is one way of earning a living either additional income or to suffice the needs of everyone. Part time jobs is very common to those whose earning is not enough that's why they were force to do part time jobs. Also doing part time jobs is a big advantage more often to the students cause while studying at the same time having a part time job gives them more training and were able to experience how to earn a living. My father encouraged me last vacation to do part time job at any food chain but I refused for reason of laziness and I don't like any hard work, but as I think it over carefully, my father was right, not for financial shortages reasons but for a reason of learning how to earn a living and how to treasure each and every cents we have. My father wants me to realize the hardships of how to earn a living in which in the end would give more benefits in general. I do hope that by next vacation, I could find a part time job so that I can experience also at my early age on how to earn a living and at the same time how to treasure every cents I have on my pocket, at any reasons it is beneficial not only on my part but also to my whole family. I admired those students who are doing part time jobs cause it's a big help to their parents as well as it gives them experiences on how to earn a living. Also, once a student graduated and having an experience of being a student and at same time doing part time jobs is an edged or advantaged in applying for a job.
