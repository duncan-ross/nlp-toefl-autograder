Now that I've conquered one part of my life and entering a new one, one question strikes the minds of us, college students, should we work a part-time job or not. Unlike some countries that working a part-time job while in high school and/or college is normal, here in my country, it isn't. Hence I disagree to the point that college students should not work while studying in college because studying to have a better life out weights its country part of working while studying. While working during college is benefits both parent and student to lessen the load of money issues, it bring in cons such as pressure, time management, etc. For one thing, college is very important to everyone in our country and also to others, it is the starting point of his new life as an adult. But balancing both work and studies and a very difficult task that putting priorities might put one or both in devastating results such as getting kicked out or getting fired from that job. Also, pressure from your boss to finish all the required things to do at work and rushing back to study will be a very difficult task to do. As a student, it is important to prioritize studying over working because after studying, you will get a better job, pay and have more time to work than while studying. It is better for both student and his family for the student to just study and socialize than adding another factor in life which is work. Work might be a good option but it's not the best option for a college student, it will only open doors to many more problems. Hence I disagree that: It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
