Doing a part time job is a good idea for teens. We never know what will happen in the future, so doing a part time job is a good way for us to try different matters and to accumulate our working experiences. However, we have to think twice as we decide whether we are going to do part time jobs or not. To begin with, the reason we choose to do a part time job instead of doing other activities is quite important. I believe that someone who does a part time job just for salary, they are wasting their time and energy on trifles. On the other hand, if we can learn something never being taught at schools or in textbooks from the experience, it is worth for us to pay our time and energy on it. In addition, a work type is also an essential element we have to consider. For example, working in a pub is not a good idea for teens. For the foretasted reasons, I think that doing a part time job may be a good step to the adult, but there is still something we have to put our eye on it, or there is no difference between doing a part time job and spending time on other activities.
