I disagree with this. There're some reason why I think so. Of course I think it is a really important thing when we think about our health. You know the secondary smoking is one of the serious problems we have to solve ASAP because it is more harmful for non-smoking people than smoking. And it is difficult to separate completely in the small restaurant for example small café or bar etc. We can't avoid the smoke in the room. But now there are other so serious problems. For example there are economic crisis, credit crunch and so many problems in the world. So a lot of people in the world can't get their jobs, were laid off and unemployed. That's why I think it is an important way to solve the problem about employment. You know in Japan there are some major tobacco companies like JT. And the companies have a lot of worker. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, some people might stop smoking. And the number of smoking people will decrease. Because of that, the tobacco companies could lay off some workers. People laid off won't be able to find their new job. So I think smoking shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
