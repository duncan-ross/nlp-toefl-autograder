I don't agree. I would add however, that it could be important but it really gets down to the individual concerned based on their needs, emotional maturity and general life experience levels. Having a part-time job while attempting to study a college degree on a full-time basis is not for everyone. In fact, I would venture to state that it could be detrimental for some more than others. While there are obvious benefits to be gained from working, the downside is that not everyone deals with pressure or stress in the same way. Placing too much pressure on oneself could quite possibly lead to dropping out, academic failure or quite literally traumatize students emotionally. This is not idle theory as there have been many examples that are a matter of public record which support my claims. I held a part-time position while I was at college and didn't encounter any difficulties which could not be easily overcome. I do recall quite clearly, that there were several students on campus who were not as blessed as I was and they experienced many, many problems which eventually led to them dropping out. So again I say, while it could be important to have a part-time job at college, it is subjective to the individual's personal circumstances.
