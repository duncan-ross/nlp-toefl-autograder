Smoking is bad at body and it can happen cancer after. Smoking in a restaurant or a road can be suffered damage to other people. Then, Smoking is banned in public places and the restaurant must make smoking seats. Smoking does not care alone. But if smoking someone give damages to other people, it is wrong. I think smoking is a preference. But I think giving up smoking is very good for one's self and other people. If someone can't give up smoking, he (or she) must not give damage to around people. And I think that reason to do not giving up smoking fall into hypnosis. For example, they have smoking, and then they study or concentrate better before they have not smoking. And I think they are cured mental treatment than we say them simply "You must give up smoking because it is bad at body". However everyone who smokes doesn't fall into hypnosis. So Except for this people who fall into hypnosis, we must respect people who smoke in 21st century. To do so, we should extend smoking areas. And people who smoke must not give damage someone who does not smoke. Because of this reason, I allow smoking if people who smoke do not give damage to other people
