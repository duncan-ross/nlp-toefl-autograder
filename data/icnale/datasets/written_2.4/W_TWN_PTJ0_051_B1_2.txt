Recently, more and more college students are devoted to part-time jobs. According to news reports, the jobs occupy them with hours, even causing them exhausted. Since it is called "part-time", why should it take so much time? Indeed, leaving home and going to a far-away town for college costs a lot. You need to buy furniture, utensils, text books, foods, paying for girlfriend... and so on. In home town, all the expenses are paid with pocket money given by parents. Now that you are far away and they need to pay for tuition fees, you are soon fallen into economical dilemma. Therefore college students make money by part-time jobs that provide more pocket money. However, the jobs provided are mostly without knowledge or skills, which mean you, are hardly to learn anything at all. OK, it is said it helps to enhance social skills when you face customers, but is it a really "professional" skill? On the other hand, the wages for $95/hour is still low for students; as a result, they prolong working hours, hoping to earn more. And consequently they are exhausted in classes. I'd like to apply the concepts in investments. The period in college is a time to store knowledge for future happiness. If you are hungry for the wages and neglect the studies, finally you would find the return rate low to the ground.
