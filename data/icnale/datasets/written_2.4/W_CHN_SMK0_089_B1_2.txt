I don't know why there is a kind of thing called cigarette in the world. Yes, I don't like it more than I can imagine. But why do people smoke, especially in the public? This activity may disturb people around the smoking man, not only because the horrible smell but the hurt it may cause to our health. So it's necessary to set up some statutes. What's the most extensive public spot in the country? I must say it's more than one, such as the park, the plaza, the square and the restaurant. But when we discuss the ban on smoking, the restaurant is stand in the breach. Because restaurants are full of people, and obviously people are eating in the restaurant, so if someone is smoking next you, you'll get the harmful smoke into your with the movement of eating. But when we look back, we'll notice the disagreement from the smokers. They said that smoking shouldn't be banned because smoking has been a part of their life. After hearing these words, I think it's become more important to ban smoking. The cigarettes become the necessary part? So the situation is serious, and we must strangle it when some young people haven't drop into the abyss. What's more? There has been a great increase in casualties in fire accidents caused by smoking in recent years. And we have also seen the ground littered with cigarette ends. Thus smoking proves to be a source of pollution for the environment and a major threat to life and property. One person always belongs to the society. The individual benefit must be subordinated to that of the society. Besides, smokers can also benefit from this ban which helps them get rid of smoking. So let's put this ban into practice soon.
