Many people say that college is a small society. College life is not only full of studying. Learning knowledge about major and improving our ability of communicating with others both are very important! In order to adapt ourselves to the fast changes of society and make our experiences more colorful, taking a part-time job in our leisure time is a good choice. It's possible for us to have a part-time job. In college, we have more freedom. Our leisure time is enough. And there are many jobs provided for you. You can make your own plan and work hard for the jobs you want to do. There is no doubt that you will benefit from the experience. Firstly, you can get direct wages. It does not only can reduce the heavy burdens of our parents, but also can taste the happiness on the moment of getting the money which is made by us. The second point, which I think is more important, is a good way to create new experiences. So we will be well prepared for our future life after we graduate from university. In conclusion, for college students taking part-time jobs is practical and important. Just try and be brave to see how far you can go.
