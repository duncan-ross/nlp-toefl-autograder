I don't agree with the topic of a college students having a part-time job. Though having a part-time job can increase social experience, personal relationships, and enrich their collage life, part-time jobs can also distract collage students on their studies if they take students too much time. They would not have enough time review or preview their classes. Insufficiency in sleeping time would also make them doze on class. For example, working during midnight has more paid but it is unhealthy for students and may bring providing problems. Above all, too many social activities decrease their passion on studying and they don't have enough time cultivate relationships with their books. On top of that, a collage part-time person should interact with many social people. That may expose them on a not simple environment unlike their university. It will be dangerous to them. Not to say working in pub, even work as a tutor or babysitter should be aware. If they bring the social bad habits like cheating or passive thinking back to their school, it may also cause negative effects on their peers. In my opinion, it is always the best policy to do perfectly what the role a person is now. If being a student, just complete the duty of studying to the best.
