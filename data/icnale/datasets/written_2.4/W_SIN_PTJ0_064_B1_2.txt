I think it is not important for college students to have part-time jobs. College is a good platform for the students to make sure that they enjoy the perks of being in school purely for the sake of studies and also extra-curricular activities. The subjects in school are more relevant to what is going to be taught in university and hence it is important to find out what interests them and also to build a good foundation and understanding once they find out what they like. As for extra-curricular activities, it helps the students build up their character, teamwork with other students and also most importantly to take up leadership positions as much as possible to train them to become stronger and more mature in terms of thought. This is also in line with the Singaporean education system that advocates for excellence in both academic and non-academic aspects. There would a lot of opportunities for the student to exhibit this new found leadership ability and sense of responsibility in the university and hence, it would be rather important for the student in college to make sure that the essential and basic skills are honed in an environment that is still much guided by the teachers. There is still chance for the student to receive feedback for his attempts to lead and guide his peers. Hence the student in college should not take up part time jobs so as to ensure the maximal amount of time to venture into these aspects of development.
