I agree with the statement of course to ban smoking in restaurants. But I think not all restaurants but should be the restaurants that serves food only. For the restaurants that sell alcohol or have mini bar may allow people to smoke because it is personal reason. Everyone has their own choice and favorite so smoking is not fault but must be in a right or appropriate place. The one who want to smoke must select the restaurants that provide place for them to smoke. They shouldn't do in the restaurants that kids is eating because it can destroy their body. They are just innocent so don't do it. the restaurants should have clearly signs in front of the restaurants this place welcome or don't welcome people to smoke. To be safe, there should be both areas for both of them. smoking and non-smoking areas. Many restaurants to do and many restaurants also that don't welcome they said it is dangerous for other people. In air condition room, must completely ban smoking because the smell will spread all over the room and don't go out. People in that room will take toxic into their body and their body will be very bad smell. So I think it should ban smoking in some places, but not all restaurants because it's personal choice.
