Firstly, before we begin on banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country, we should go through its harmful effects. Smoking is harmful, not just to the smoker, but as well as to the surrounding people as well. In fact, it has been scientifically proven that second-hand smokers are at a higher risk of getting lung cancer or related diseases instead of the smokers. This is a downside of smoking as it harms the innocent ones instead, which is entirely immoral and wrong. Besides harming loved ones and oneself, smoking changes the ambience of an area. For example, smoking at restaurants would give off the impression that the food outlet is not suitable for families with children as it caters more towards adults and smokers. This chain-reaction directly affects the business of the restaurant adversely especially if it did not mean to present itself as a smoker joint in the first place. Going further, the economy of the country would also be adversely affected in the long run, from the loss of revenue from these smoker restaurants. Lastly, smoking should be banned at restaurants as eating while smoking do not go well together. Eating is a social activity which is enjoyed by all pleasantly. Imagine having to inhale smoke while chomping on your food. It would be a disastrous experience. However, smoking could still be allowed in certain parts of the restaurant. Restaurants could still try to attract smokers by designating a certain area, best if outdoors, as a smoking area. This divides the smokers and non-smokers fairly, creating a win-win situation for everyone.
