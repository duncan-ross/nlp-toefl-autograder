My topic is that part time job is necessary for college students. First of all I want to say here is that to do job is necessary for every person to exist in this social network. As we have to be a social person. And by this job we make money, so when we have a decent amount of money; we can exist and survive in this world more easily. But according to this topic, in which it is said part time jobs are necessary for students. Ok, now see just when we hear the word part time we become uneasy because this demands more energy from our side which just irritates the student. It is more painful for a student because in the day time they have to do study and if after that they will do job then it will be too much and their routine will also be disturbed. But some poor students who are facing some financial problems, they have to do part time jobs to survive in this cruel society. As we know that this is the age of NAFSA NAFI, no one thinks about even his real brother, no one help you when you will be in any kind of problem, we are to help ourselves. In other word I can say that this society doesn't allow a poor person to live freely. The only person is honored in this world who is rich in wealth, it doesn't see weather he is rich in knowledge or not. In the end I want to say that jobs are necessary but not for students because if they do so, they can't concentrate on their studies which will result in the bad future of the students and my beloved country Pakistan.
