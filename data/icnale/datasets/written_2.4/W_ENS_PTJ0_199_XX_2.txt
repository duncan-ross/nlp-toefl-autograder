Part-time employment can be a valuable way for students to gain new perspectives on the world which they may not have considered before. For example, some of my students find internships at foreign companies which have established branches in the US. When my students work with people from another culture and country, they often come to me with new insights and new business ideas which they had never even considered before. A few of the business ideas are so unique that even I have not considered them before. This obvious benefit can help students by allowing them to gain the ability to think in a broader manner and to have a more global perspective on the world. In the increasingly global world in which we live, this kind of perspective can be very valuable and can help the students to procure high paying and prestigious positions at large corporations where they can enjoy many years of stable work and excellent benefits. As a final note, many of my students report that the money they can gain from a part-time job, while small, is an excellent incentive and taste of what they have to expect in the future when they start fulltime work. I am happy that they can have an opportunity like that to become more motivated to try hard in their classes.
