In my opinion. I agree for completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Because I do not like Smoking and I do not like smoke. The smoke make bad lung. Cell in lung is expiring. Terminal you will die. So the government banned at all the restaurants in the country. And Smoking cause to fire a build and station. It is dangerous. Last two weeks I watch a news, the house got fire because a man in the hose smoke and the cigarettes burn the hose. It is small thing but it can destroy everything. He lost his house and lose his health. People around smokers also got bad health. Many women died because their husbands smoking in the house. She smoke the smell of the cigarettes. Finally, she died before her husband because of lung cancer. What a pity!! If the government can do, they should banned all smoking in all restaurants. It can save many people can it can save air to be fresh. I think it should be serious thing to worry. If the policy is strong, people will respect it and obey the rule. But no one serious about this. I think it should completely banned.
