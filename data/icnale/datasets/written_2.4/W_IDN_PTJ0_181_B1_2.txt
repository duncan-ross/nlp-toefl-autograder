Is it important for college students to have a part time job? Well, I think it is depends on each personal or student whether they want to get a part time job or not! With also consider situation of that person or student, look at his or her family economic situation. If the economic situation of that person or student not very good I think it is better if that person or student try to get some part time job that can help themselves to make some money that can help their parents to pay some credits of their education. To get a part time job also not easy I think, look at the situation of economic right now. All of big and small company looking for employee that had an experience in every single kind of job that they apply for. They must have patient in their effort when they try to look a part time job to help them make some money for their education, also to give them some important experience.
