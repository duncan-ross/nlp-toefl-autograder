I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, It reduces harmful effect of second-hand smoking. If smoking is free at restaurants, it may have a bad effect on non-smokers. Especially, the old and the infirm have great damage. Exposure to second-hand smoke can slow children's body growth owing to causing gene modification and easily bring about getting cancer. And it is quite probable that children who are exposed to passive smoke catch the cold. Also, involuntary smoking during pregnancy can cause serious health problems to a fetus. Second, It is because if small place starts banning smoking, our country's may tend to take it for granted that people are non-smoker. These days some people have a hard time resting of life because of lung cancer. They are very sorry that they start smoking. But if we carry out this rule, it can reduce smokers and prevent teen's smoking. For these reasons, I really agree about that. However, of course it may exits a restaurant owners who think that their sales fall. I'd like to tell them, "Having a long-range view is better than only thinking your profits. " And I want all people to be freed of smoking at the restaurants and be healthy.
