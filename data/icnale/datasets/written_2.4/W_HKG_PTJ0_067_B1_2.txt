We are university students. It is important for us to have a part-time job! Certificate is a MUST to those going to purse sparkling futures. Yet, working experience weighs as heavily as certificate. A computer not only needs well-designed hardware, but also up-to-dated software to support. Working experience is similar to software to computer. Working with others, students are able to develop their soft skills and improve personality to be all-round people. This benefits everyone no matter how good or bad one performs academically. Most of the time, dealing with interpersonal issues is more complicated than solving mathematical problems because people always change minds. University students are believed to be well equipped with knowledge. So, to further succeed in the future, students should behave more mature, responsibly and independently. And certainly we cannot practice these by reading textbooks. Besides experience, money is always a big issue for students. Joining societies or language courses, hanging out with friends, dressing more nicely for some reasons etc. all need money. We are not teenagers anymore. Asking money from parents for everything is certainly not a responsible and mature way. In order to pay for all entertainments we want to join, getting a part-time job is obviously the best way out. Fun usually comes with price. Also, it is the first step for self- finance. We, being university students, are preparing and upgrading ourselves to fight in the world few years later. It is a short time for so much preparation work. Thus, shall we work on multitasks: studying and working?
