 In my own point of view, it's not so important, as many people would think, for college students to get a part-time job. To discuss whether we should have a part-time job, we must figure out why some people would take a part-time job so seriously. After thoughtful consideration, I come up with three reasons with which they would put up. The first one, maybe the most important for someboby, is that it could help support you through college, lessen the burden of parents. As for the second one, I think it's that it provides the opportunity for college students to get familiar with the world, according to them. Most importantly, they believe that it could offer them work experience. However, I'm not quite for that. First of all, the students who devote a lagre part of their time into part-time jobs are not sensible at all, provided that money is the only reason why they do that. Parents support them with their hardwork, hoping you to obtain knowledge as much as possible, while you exchange the precious time for little money. Moreover, the university is a miniature society, where you could have access to the world. There is no need fou you to do a part-time job particularly to know about the society. If work experience, instead of knowledge, is what you really want, why don't you just drop out of school and find a full-time job? As a consequence, I believe that it's not necessary for college students to do a part-time job.
