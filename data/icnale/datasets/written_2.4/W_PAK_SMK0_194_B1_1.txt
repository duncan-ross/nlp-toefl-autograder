Interval, gradual, healthy way of life, change of brand fruit, mouth wash. By smoking we usually mean smoking of tobacco. There are many people who are addicted to the smoking of opium and other intoxicating drugs. People use various kinds of apparatus for tobacco-smoking such as hookah, pipes, cigars, cigarettes and cheroots. Tobacco was first brought from America to Europe Early one day in 1492, Columbus's shipmates saw the people of island (now known as Cuba) smoking bundles of rolled leaves. They copied this habit and became smoking. Later on Sir Walter Raleigh introduced tobacco and smoking in Europe. Hookah-smoking was known to Eastern Kings. The Physicians used it as a cure for stomach-troubles. Now smoking is one of the most popular habits. Even women have caught up this habit. The new issue of no smoking in restaurants is a very controversial topic that people feel is unfair and unconstitutional. People believe it is unconstitutional because it is against the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot do. I agree with this law because with cigarettes particularly, the most harm is done to the non-smoker, an innocent bystander. In restaurants these bystanders are usually the employees. Employees that don't smoke don't have the choice to sit in the non-smoking section, they must work in the entire restaurant and subject themselves to second-hand smoke which is more harmful than actually smoking.
