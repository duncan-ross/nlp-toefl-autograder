We are as college students have more energy or power to do many things in our life. It will be an interesting thing if we are students but having money by our self. In this case, we have a part – time job beside our schedule in the college. We have more incomes with doing some jobs. With having a part – time job, we can also help our parents. We will not disturb them for some little things, such as for buying some books, make up, etc.. Students who have a part – time job will take some benefits. 1. student will have income (money) by their self. So they can help their parents. 2. they will be discipline person. Because they usually have good schedule between studying and working; 3. they will have more interactions time with people. that is important for them when they are working after graduation from the college. Communication skill is needed in the real work; 4. they can study how to be good businessmen, etc.. There are some things that make college students cannot work (part – time job). In some case, some of them have a problems with their schedule in their college. They are too busy. Their schedule is full of doing study and homework or other activities. In different case, some students do not want to have a part – time job because they feel have much money (maybe they come from rich family) so, they are focus on their studying only. Every man have their own chosen. But doing a different things (like have a part-time job) will give us more experiences.
