Hong Kong SAR Government has enforced a ban on public venues, including restaurants, on 1 January, 2007. I welcome this implementation very much, as I agree on the ban of smoking in all restaurants. The first obvious reason is, smoking is bad for our health. It is close to common sense that smoking cause a lot of serious diseases. Many researches have also concluded when statements indicating that smoking induce cancers and raise the risk of heart diseases. Such a dangerous habit is therefore a major threat to the public health and a burden in medical health care system. Secondly, the fume from the cigarette smoke is also harmful to the non-smokers around. This is referred as ""second-hand smoking"". Research findings leads to the fact that most of the harmful substances in the process of cigarettes burning eventually go to the atmosphere. That means the non-smokers will be the sink of the these undesirable gases. Innocent second-hand smokers, thought do not smoke, suffer a equivalent or even greater risk in developing cancers or other serious illness. Last but not least, the fume from the cigarette smoke has a bad odour. If these fumes get into the restaurants and inhaled by the diners, they will surely lose their appetite. It is hence a very inconsiderate move to allow anyone to smoke in the restaurants. In conclusion, the consequence of allow smoking in the restaurants is grave. Therefore, I oppose the idea smoking in the restaurants.
