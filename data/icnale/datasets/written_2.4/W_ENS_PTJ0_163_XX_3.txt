I agree because they can learn some basic financial skills such as budgeting, get some organisational skills and generally get to know what it is like to have to go to work. The big thing for me when I was working and studying was that I learned that I had to be responsible but more importantly, act responsibly. I could not just take off and go to parties with my mates when I felt like it. I did have some trouble with time management at first, but after my first few stuff ups, I managed to get it right, for the most part anyway. I was given no slack from my lecturers either although my boss was pretty good to me. I hear a lot of kids complaining and crying about how tough it is and I always think that they have no idea what tough is. My idea of tough is living in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Africa where people are shooting at you or you are dying from hunger. Now that is doing it tough in my opinion not working part-time and then sitting in an air-conditioned room at university or college with a fast food cafeteria downstairs. But then, I guess it is all subjective to our own experiences and opinions.
