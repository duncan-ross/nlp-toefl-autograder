I agree, because students for have low money can do part time job for earn some money. They can do many jobs, such as a waiter, a computer mechanic, etc. Do the job seriously so you can earn good money too. Sometimes students from the outside city will do this for earn some money. Because they are far away from their parents. Their parents cannot send them money often. The first step is manage your time between your time at campus and time at your workplace. Maybe you want work 30- 35 hours in a week, or maybe less then it. Then do your activities without worries about wasting time in other side. Do not spend out your money fast, you will have no money at all. The money you earn, you can spend it to pay your college per semester. Manage your income and outcome, do not make your outcome bigger than your income. And do not forget to bank it some. Bank your money so you can easier manage your economy. Learn to your friends or teacher how to manage money. Keep pray and do good job, money will come to you easily.
