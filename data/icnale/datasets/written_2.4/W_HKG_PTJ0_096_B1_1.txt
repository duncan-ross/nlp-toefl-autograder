Currently, university students are needed to pay different fee such as tuition fee and hall fee. They also need to pay for their lunch and dinner. Therefore, many university students are having a part-time job to earn enough money for their life. In the following essay, I will mention the pros and cons about having a part-time job. First of all, university students can learn many skills and gain working experience from the part-time job. When they are working on the part-time job, they need to communicate with the colleague or even the customer. During these conversations, they can realize their weakness and improve the communication skills from time to time. On the other hand, they can try different types of part-time job such as sales and waiter so that they can enrich their resume by adding these working experiences in the future. However, doing part-time job can improve their skills, but some students may encounter a side effect – bad academic result due to time management. Some students are indicated that they spend every night to do the part-time job such that they are affordable to buy different luxury goods. IPhone 4 and IPad are an example. They spend all the time for the part-time job every day, so the time that they can spend on the school work is under the normal. Therefore, they finally get a bad academic result. To conclude, if those students who are getting a bad academic result due to doing part-time job can arrange their time well, the problem can be solved strict forwardly. Therefore, I agree university students having a part-time job.
