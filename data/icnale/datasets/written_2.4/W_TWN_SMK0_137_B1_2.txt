When it comes to whether should we ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country, I strongly advocate anti-smoking campaign. I think we shouldn't only limit the area in restaurants; instead, we should broaden the activity to everywhere. There are two aspects of smoking. They are the inside and outside parts. Let's take a look at the inside part. First, smoking weakens our respiratory system, like the lung, nose, throat, bronchus etc. Second, people who have a craving for smoking gain the royal road to the hell of lung cancer. Third, a chain smoker usually has a bad breath and this can be a big deduction of one's appearance. Fourth, if a pregnant woman keeps smoking, it is highly possible that the baby may be abnormal or even dead. As for the outside part, smoking cause great air pollution as well as broken the atmosphere from place to place. In addition, second-hand smoke also causes great damages for nonsmokers, making them dizzy, vomit, even respiratory failure. Still, there is third-hand smoke existing on the wall, our clothes........ etc. Third-hand smoke also threatens our health. Smoking accompany us forever if we don't exert ourselves to ban it. Combining both inside and outside parts, I suggest that we should do our best to ban smoking not only at the restaurants but every place. This way, the nationals' longevity can be prolonged; the national economy can also keep progressing, and our invisible welfare can be highly raised. Therefore, I approve that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
