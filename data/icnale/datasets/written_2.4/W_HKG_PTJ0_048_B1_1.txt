Is it important for the university students have a part-time job? It is a question being controversial for a long time. For my point of view, it is not important for a university student to have a part-time job. University is a place for students to learn knowledge, it just similar to secondary school, it is one of the ways that we can get a better job in the future. Student paid a lot of effort so as to getting into university to study the subject which they are interested in, and study is the responsibility of the student, having part-time job may takes their time on study and may not concentrate on their study. This may leads to a bad result in the examination or even cannot graduate if their result is very bad. In some case, student may need financial support because their parent cannot afford the expense in university, but there are many ways to get financial support such as the TSFS of the government or the University Financial Assistant, student who need financial support can apply these program to get the financial support, it is not a must to have part-time job for their daily expense.
