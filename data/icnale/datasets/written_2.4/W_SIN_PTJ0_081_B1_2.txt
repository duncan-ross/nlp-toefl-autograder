A part-time job is defined as a job outside the curriculum time of the college student. I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. However, the supporting reasons are subjected to the assumption that the student can manage his academic demands before taking up a job. Having a part-time job will allow a student to be more financially independent and learn to manage his finance, which is an essential skill to have. With the extensive expenditure of a college student, it would relief the burden off their parents or other sources of finance if they were able to find a part-time job. Moreover, students can learn interpersonal skills through working, which would benefit them in their future career. Students can also benefit others through their work by providing part-time work only when required by their employers, which is a cheaper and more efficient alternative for the employers. It would be a fruitful way of using his knowledge and spending his time. However, there is a limit to the job of a student as his primary aim is to ensure that he does well academic-wise. He should not sacrifice his academic work for his part-time job.
