I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, as second hand smoke is very harmful to non-smokers. This is because secondhand smoke contains chemicals such as nicotine that is cancerous. In addition, we have to take into consideration that it is highly likely that children would be dining at these restaurants too. If the restaurants were air-conditioned, these restaurants would smell bad as well. If smoking were banned, it would create a healthier environment at the restaurants. As non-smokers cannot avoid inhaling smoke, it would make more sense for smokers to avoid smoking at restaurants. On the other hand, it would make life more difficult for smokers. They have fewer options when they want to look for restaurants. Banning smoking from restaurants thus also affect families who has a smoker in their family. It is also difficult for heavy smokers to resist smoking in restaurants, as they are addicted to smoking. From the perspectives of restaurants owners, they may suffer from a decline in business when they ban smoking in restaurants. It is also difficult for them to enforce this rule, as smokers might be highly offended when they are asked to stop smoking. This is why most governments are reluctant to enforce a ban on smoking in all restaurants. To come up with win-win situations, they have decided to separate the smokers from the non-smokers by offering a dining section just for the smokers. Therefore, I think that it is not feasible to ban smoking and that we should continue to enforce the rule in which non-smokers are separated from non-smokers.
