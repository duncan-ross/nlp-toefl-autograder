I agree with this statement, albeit with a caveat: smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, but restaurants should also have the right to demarcate a small portion of their premises for smokers too. Certainly adults should have the right to smoke, even as a large portion of the population in developed countries recognize the dangers of smoking. Still, this right cannot be an unfettered right. Smoking in public is certainly not an individual act, because of the public health risks that second-hand smoke bring. If smokers decide to light up in public, they should expect that the list of places they can smoke at will necessarily be limited. As such, I believe that while restaurants can still choose to allow smoking in their premises, the area dedicated to smoking should be enclosed, constitute only a small part of the floor area, and not pose an inconvenience to other non-smoking customers. While some liberal critics might deride a ban on smoking in restaurants as a draconian measure, I believe that my stand is a completely reasonable one. I respect that smokers deserve a space--- albeit a restricted one---in public to indulge in their act, but I also give precedence to the fact that non-smokers deserve to enjoy an environment that is smoke-free and non-detrimental to their health. My proposal of a nuanced ban therefore respects the two camps in such a debate: neither side will have their rights curtailed.
