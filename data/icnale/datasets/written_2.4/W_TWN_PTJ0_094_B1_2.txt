One of the main financial sources of college students, part time job has its pros and cons. As advantages, first, part time job helps students earn some extra money to support their tuition and daily expense, especially when there are more and more families influenced by economic depression. Second, even if their families are well off, the students could gain a higher sense of independency through being more responsible for their own needs, which may also make them more thankful toward their hard-working parents. Third, part time job may provide some early experiences of careers and society, and could also help establishing the networking which may benefit the students' lives in a near future when they begin their businesses. On the other hand, part time job has several negative influences on students, too. The primary one is that having a part time job usually eats up the time that students may need for their genuine task: studying. It would be a pity if a student turns out to sacrifice learning for a waiter job which pays only 100 NTD per hour, since the former is often more valuable as an investigation of the future. Another disadvantage is the risk of being confronted with bad employers who mean to trick innocent students. Some may cut down the salary for a variety of reasons; some may commit sexual harassment or even rape, taking advantages of students who dare not to condemn the boss. In short, part time job should be carefully considered when students usually focus more on the positive side of the thing.
