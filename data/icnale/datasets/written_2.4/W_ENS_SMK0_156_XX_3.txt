I used to think that smoking should be outlawed and that all smokers were idiots but then I kind of changed my mind on this. I have a lot of friends and they live all around the world so there are many viewpoints to consider. Cigarettes are bad for everyone of this I have no doubt but when you think about it, so are ice cream, soda and candy. I mean too much of eating that stuff can kill everybody too. So I think that who am I to sit in judgment on smokers when I have found that the smokers who are my friends are quite artistic, sociable, likable and just all around nice people except they happen to smoke. I guess that they are free to do as they like and I have since come to the conclusion that while I don't believe that all smokers are idiots, I still think that it should be banned in public places and also restaurants. There are thousands of smokers all over the world and while we might not be able to get them to quit, then at least we can protect some of our spaces and the air that we breathe by restricting them. It's not healthy to smoke at any time but it is even worse to smoke while you're eating. So I say, go ahead Japan and issue a ban in all restaurants.
