Some may have financial problems in their family. Maybe their parents cannot afford all the expenses in school. Some maybe just want to buy all their desires. For example, they just want to buy new high-tech gadgets and new clothes. While some maybe just want to have an experience in new things. Although their reasons are good and valid, they still need to be more responsible in balancing their time between studies, family, and social life.
