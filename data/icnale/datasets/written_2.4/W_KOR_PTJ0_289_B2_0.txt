Now, it becomes impossible to imagine college students whose lives would be restricted to only school work. Many students have to take a part time job in order to simply continue their studies. Although all students have different reasons of having extra work after school the two can be considered the most common. First of all, the tuition that students have to pay per semester is becoming extremely high not considering many other expenses students have deal with in their everyday life. Most of them usually make ends meet trying to simply survive. Another most widely known reason of having a part job lies in students' desire and need to expand their knowledge in the field of their studies. That's why many of them are working as interns in order to gain an appropriate experience that would be necessary in their future profession. In doing so, students, who cannot be considered novices, try to realize their theoretical knowledge that they have learnt at school through practical things. After all, it can be said that taking part time job students are able to kill two birds with one stone, first, to earn money to satisfy their living expenses, and, second, broaden knowledge in the field of their studies that make it part time job is one of the prerequisites of successful school life.
