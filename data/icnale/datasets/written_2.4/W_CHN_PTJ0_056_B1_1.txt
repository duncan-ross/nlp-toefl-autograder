 After graduate from high school, we are already 19 years old. It is time for us to lead our own life. So many students find a job to experience our lives. And it has become common. But is it important for college students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is of significance. Although it is a truth that for a college student, his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations, but it is also important to experience our lives. As a student, if study is you everything you may lose a lot of fun in our colorful life. In addition, the reason why we learn theoretical knowledge is to apply them to practice. So apart-time job is a chance for us to use the knowledge. To a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. He will have the precious opportunity to meet people from different areas and will face a variety of problems. Furthermore, work helps a student to develop greater independence, and earning his own pocket money can teach him how to handle his finances. Finally, a part-time job can help a student to develop a greater sense of responsibility and team-work spirit. In one word, I believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college.
