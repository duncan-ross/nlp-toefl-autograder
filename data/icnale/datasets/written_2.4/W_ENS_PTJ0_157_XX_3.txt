I really think that it is a smashing idea that students can work and study at the same time because they are getting the best of both worlds. When I was studying, I had several part-time jobs working as a barmaid in many pubs working all sorts of odd hours. I didn't mind though because I got to meet a lot of interesting people while getting paid to do it which for me was fantastic. Another thing that worked out really well was that even with my degree (IT) I couldn't always get the job that I wanted when I was travelling. But I could pretty much get a job in most places as a barmaid. I was also able to afford a lot of things that I would never have been able to buy without a part-time job. I had to be really careful with managing my time though because I almost flunked a couple of exams but I managed to get by and it taught me to organize my life and study times with a bit more care. Even though I really enjoyed the work, you have to be careful and remember that they expect you to work so it's not like you can just walk in and start any time you like. You have to use a bit of common sense and be responsible otherwise you won't have a job for very long that's for sure.
