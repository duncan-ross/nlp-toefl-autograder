If someone has plenty of time after his or her work, he or she can pick up a job, so it is called part-time job. Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. While others don't agree with it because they think part-time job takes too much time. I agree with the point of the former opinion. Part-time job has a lot of benefits. First, it can prevent one from wasting time and can help him get some pocket money. Then part-time job can enrich one's experience and widen one's horizon. Sometimes, a part-time job can bring you something special like love and life-long friendship. Also, there are some disadvantages of part-time job. For example, it may take up one's whole part time and he may have no time to rest himself. And it can also bring us a lot of pressure as we have the responsibility to do the job well. However, part-time job is only part-time job. We can choose whether to do it or not depending on our own conditions. But part-time job is definitely a good chance to challenge ourselves and earn some pocket money. So if you can keep the balance between study and part-time job, you can have a try.
