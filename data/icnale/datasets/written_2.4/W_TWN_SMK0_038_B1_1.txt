Restaurant is a airtight place. It is hard to make the air circulate. If someone smokes in the restaurant, it would make the air worst. Besides, it is reported that the health of people who smoke the second-hand smoke is much worst than the one smoking. The ingredients in the tobacco could make our respiratory system and nervous system operate slowly. Even they might be damaged because of a long time of smoking. Restaurant is a public place. The people who would come to restaurant look for a clean and comfortable place to have a meal. Even many parents would bring their children to restaurant. At that time, someone smokes in the restaurant; the people in the same place would smoke the smell. People eat the meal and smell the smoke. The feeling would not be good and feel depressed. And people have the right which refuses to smoke second-hand smoke. It is nonsense that because of the right of a few people, sacrificing the right of most people. In order to avoid this circumstance, the government has set the law about smoking in the public places. However, no all of restaurant follow this law. In order to give everyone a good eating place, smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. Everyone in the country and the government should make a big effort to achieve this goal.
