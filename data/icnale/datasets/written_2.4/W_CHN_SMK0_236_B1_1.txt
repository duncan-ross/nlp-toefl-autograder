As for smoking, to most of us, maybe it is indeed a bad behavior. There are many reasons like doing harm to health. However smoking also has its own advantages. To begin with, it can relieve people's pressure. People, living in the 21 century, are always under pressure. That pressure comes from every thing, such as work, family matters, study, social contact and so on. So of course, people will use some ways to relieve their unhappiness. Smoking is just one of the most popular ways. When people smoke, they maybe can forget what enable them upset and worried, like drinking. Then, it can create large financial profits. No matter where it is, cigarette trade is undoubtedly larger than most trade, because the number of people using it is very huge. It can help a society or a country develop their natural economy. At last, it's also a culture. As many people use it for a long time, it has become a social habit. When people visit their friends, they may send a pack of cigarette. When colleagues enjoy a meal together, they may express politeness by sending a cigarette. Although it has its own advantages, smoking too much will cause more troubles. So I don't encourage people to take smoking as a living hobby. Use it in the special occasion and never get hooked to smoking, that's enough.
