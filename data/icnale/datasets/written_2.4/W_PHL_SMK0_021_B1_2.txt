Public places are supposed to be isolated from smoking zones especially in restaurants. We all know that restaurants are well known places that people use to go and look forward to have a good time and eat pleasant meal. Unfortunately, all of their expectations lead to disappointments due to the odor of the smoke. Most of our restaurants and bars have no proper ventilation. This is one of the reasons some people prefer not to go there due to the smell of cigarette smoke. It is strongly uncomfortable for non-smoking people to get into a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke wafts. For instance, when family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for non-smokers in order not to let their children have a contact with unhealthy smoke. It is proven that people who do not smoke are the ones who suffer from the unpleasant smell of the cigarette smoke rather than those who really smoke. People should always put in mind that, restaurants are for eating, not smoking. The scientists are sure that passive smoking is very harmful for our health. In other words, smoking is really unhealthy. Banning it from public places especially in restaurants will only bring advantages. We will worry no more whether the air we breath contains nicotine. Moreover, people will now appreciate the clean air that they breathe and at the same time, they will enjoy the food that they eat even more.
