In my opinion smoking must completely banned from our society not only banned it at the restaurants. Everybody knows that smoking is not just harmful only the person who smokes, it harms other people around him, too caused of the smoke from his cigarette. When someone smokes, people around him will disgust and escape from him. Especially in the restaurants, smoking may expel the customers. Although some restaurants prepare smoking area for the clients, there is still bad atmosphere there. I think they should use the smoking area for doing anything is more useful than just smoking. Completely banned smoking at the restaurants, there are more advantages than disadvantages. The restaurants that banned smoking will be more acceptable than other restaurants that allowed smoking. I think all restaurants should campaign people to quit smoking and show how dangerous effect from smoking, may be by using advertisement on the board of their restaurants. When the restaurants have no smokers, customers will increase than before, the atmosphere of the restaurants will be fresh and they can make more incomes, too. So, all the restaurants must completely banned smoking, to make the clients feel happy and enjoy with the service form the restaurants. The restaurants that can do like this, will be the awesome restaurants for sure.
