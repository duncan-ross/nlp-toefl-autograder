We have been college students. It seems that we are more relaxed than high school students because we have fewer lessons and we are more relaxed than people who have worked because we don't have to earn much money to support ourselves and our family. However, we are not relaxed as it seems to be. In fact, it is important for us to have a part-time job. Firstly, we indeed have more spare time than others. After class, we have a lot of time to learn by ourselves. But most of us spend much time in playing computer games or walking streets with no mind. It is better to find a part-time job during this time. Secondly, considering we need to gain social experiences before graduation and college life can't offer us many chances, we can do a part-time job to improve our social abilities. Thirdly, we can earn some money to reduce our parents' burden. Though most of parents ask us not to worry about the expenses in college, as a college student, we are old enough to do so and we are responsible to support ourselves even our parents. In addition, some students may come up with an idea of their future job. For example, many successful businessmen had their company when they were college students. As a college student, we should have a sense of responsibility for ourselves, our family and the society. We want a part-time job and it will benefit us.
