As far as I am concerned, whether to have a part-time job during my college semesters is not a big deal. I think college is a place where I can learn lots of things by studying schoolwork, joining clubs, holding activities with my classmates, or do whatever I like if I manage my time well. I can go traveling on vacations, studying abroad as an exchange student, doing volunteer affair, or even joining a music concert, a training workshop outside the school is all seemed fantastic to me. I think studying in college is a process for me to understand myself more. I can arrange lots of activities for myself. There's no rule that I should follow someone's principle that limit my time. I'll learn to be independent and be responsible for me and others. However, I think doing a part-time job is not so important to me that I must find one. I can learn lots of things by doing other things. Part-time job is not the only source. And it also has lots of risk in it according to what kind of part-time job I find. If I should find one, I will choose a job which is correspond to my major or my interest so that the experience can be a benefit in my future. Or, it can make me realize the difficulty to earn money that can train myself to be socialized earlier before graduation. Except for above reasons, I strongly don't think a part-time job is so important for a college student.
