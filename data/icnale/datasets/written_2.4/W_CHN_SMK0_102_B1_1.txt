Nowadays, more and more people have realized the disadvantages of smoking. Smoking is doing harm to not only smokers themselves but also some relative persons who are together with smokers. Namely, the negative influence of smoking can be passed among all of people. There are so many disadvantages of smoking. So should we have to ban smoking in the public restaurant? Of course not. In Chinese culture, smoking is always taking possession of most part in interacting. People even can't feel a perfect meal without smoking in the end. Maybe it's hard to change the habit formed several years. Besides, smoking is sometimes a way of communicating with others. During meals, some people smoke because they want someone to change the attitudes towards themselves. Some people smoke because they want to improve the relationship between others, while others want to deal with their business efficiently. Taking my family as an example. I have a big family, and of course males like smoking. My grandpa and my father as well as my uncles would smoke when women are cleaning the dishes after dinner. In their views, it's a good way to improve the emotion of families. And we are all used to that. For us, it's really difficult to change that immediately. So it's much better to obey the habit than to break despite of disadvantages of smoking.
