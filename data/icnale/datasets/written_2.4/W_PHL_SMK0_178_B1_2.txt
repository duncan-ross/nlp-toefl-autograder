We all know that smoking is dangerous to our health as it is already put on almost half of the front of the cigarette pack but how many of us know that whenever a smoker smokes a cigarette, the dangers of smoking is brought not only to the smoker, but also the people who inhales the smoke? A cigarette contains ingredients that are mostly toxic. When a smoker exhales the smoke from the cigarette, some of the toxic properties of the cigarette come with the smoke and when others inhale the smoke, now called a secondhand smoke, they will also consume those properties. Study shows that an equivalent of a cigarette smoke is the smoke coming from the exhaust system of a car. Both are as toxic as the other. Imagine inhaling smoke coming from cars, all of those toxic things inside your lungs. The result of inhaling secondhand smoke from a cigarette smoker is lung cancer, a very fatal and incurable disease. The death of smokers is nearly the same as those who died of secondhand smoke, a survey shows. Therefore, with all these points raised, I say we should ban smoking in public places, especially restaurants as nonsmokers find it unpleasant to eat while smelling the scent of cigarettes.
