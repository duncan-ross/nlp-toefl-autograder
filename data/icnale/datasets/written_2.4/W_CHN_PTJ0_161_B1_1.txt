 I think a part-time job for the college students is very important. It is benefit for us in every aspect. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, part-time job can help them to solve money problem, especially those coming from poor families. It also can lighten the burden of their parents. Many students from poor families cannot afford college fees, and our bank system fail to loan college students as effectively as it does in developed countries, so taking part-time jobs becomes a way for them to meet their great expenses in campus lives. Secondly, part-time jobs will offer us a chance to demonstrate our ability and make us more independent. Of course it can improve the ability of our communication and enrich our social experience. We may get some useful information during the process of looking for a job. You know, many companies tend to employ the one who has working experience. Because they have better quality to solve problems than other. Moreover, we can put what we have learned in class to practice, and share the experience with our classmates. We cannot learn all kinds of skills in the university, so we'd better find a part-time job to enrich our mind and broaden our field of vision. In a word, we will benefit a lot from part-time jobs.
