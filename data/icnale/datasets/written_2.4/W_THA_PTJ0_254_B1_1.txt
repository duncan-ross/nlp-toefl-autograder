I agree with the topic that part-time job is important to college students because college students have to spend much money such as education, food, and accommodation. This is especially for students' education. Students should have a part-time job helping them to earn much money. They can do a part-time job after they have finished studying. Moreover, part-time job is a good way that college students can practice their work skills before going to work in the future. On the other hand, doing a part- time job may not influence students' studying, if they allocate time to their studying. When the students can earn enough money paying for their food or their dormitory, their parents are not important to pay for college students. According to me, I have to work as a part-time job. I sing every night earning much money to pay for my education and also pay for looking after my family. Actually, Part-time job helps students to spend free time usefully. When students get a lot of money, they will give back to parents for making merit. So, college students should find out a part-time job or jobs to earn much money, it will help not only your earning much money but also your practicing work skills.
