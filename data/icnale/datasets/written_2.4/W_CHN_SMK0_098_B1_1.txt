It is considered that smoking do harm to people. To the person who smokes, however, may be it can benefit them in some way. People have different preferences which lead to various perspectives. Personally, I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I support to restrict people smoking in public areas. Because smoking can not only hurt the health of smokers but also influence the passive smokers, it's reasonable to ban smoking in some public places. The restriction can help people quit smoking as well as benefit the nonsmokers. But, it's improper to ignore the feeling of smokers. People have right to do what they what if they don't hurt other ones. We all agree that it's impolite for people to smoke without the agreement of people besides. However, if smokers want to have a get-together, why can't they share the pleasure of smoking? There are two alternative solutions. One is that restaurants can set some smoking area for smokers other than rub their right to smoke simply. Smokers should have smoking area to stay while nonsmokers can choose nonsmoking area. You won't think it proper when a ninety-year-old has to smoke standing outside the restaurant in winter after he have smoked indoor for sixty years. Another idea is that government can slightly decrease the tax if the restaurants which ban smoking. For some restaurant may afraid that policy will influence their income for lose some smoking customs.
