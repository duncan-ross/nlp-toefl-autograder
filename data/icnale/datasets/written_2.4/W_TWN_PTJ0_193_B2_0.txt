No, I don't agree with that. In my opinion, college is not a job training center, but a grand temple of keeping knowledge and learning. As a college student, we certainly have freedom and maturity to make our own decisions, including deciding to get a part-time job or not. However, most part-time jobs are just wasting time to get little money. Except for contacting to more people and some skills, all you're doing is keeping repeating the same movement, such as doing dishes and pouring water, etc. It is probably not related to your work in the future, and giving no help to your resume. Furthermore, you can do nothing after work, since you're so exhausted after work, you would only want to get a rest. On the other hand, you can study more; go on a trip, or doing something more meaningful during the same period. What a shame! Second, since the rate of jobless people is still high, the part-time working students are definitely another pressure for them. Plus, the salary students get paid is not much. If we have enough allowance we got from parents for living expenses, there is no urgent need for us to get a part-time job in our 20s. To conclude, there are more deficits than advantages in having a part-time job. It may cut off your studying hours and your leisure time. What's more, what you get paid back is much less than your cost, your invaluable youth.
