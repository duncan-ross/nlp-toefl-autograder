In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. There are two kinds of restaurant room. Smoker room and non-smoker room. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries So, for any body is not smoker, they can enjoy in the special room that different with smoker room. There is another argument rages over the effects of smoking on public health. But in other hand, smoking tobacco is not illegal act, yet the 25 percent of Americans who do smoke are often treated as if they was criminals. They are incessantly nagged, blamed for numerous illnesses and unpleasantries, and made to feel guilty by self-righteous non-smokers. So, banning smoking in all public restaurant violates principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers. However, smokers in the restaurant must choose the smoking area so that they will not harm the other customers who do not smoke and need the clean-air environment.
