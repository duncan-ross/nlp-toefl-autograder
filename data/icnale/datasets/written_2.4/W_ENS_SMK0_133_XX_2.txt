Apart from the extraordinary number of health risks to smokers and non-smokers caused by smoking and in the case of non smokers, passive smoking, there is also the cost to the taxpayer for health care etc. I don't believe that anybody is arguing against any adult's right to smoke as they see fit. But, there is also irrefutable evidence to prove that passive smokers end up paying the same price as smokers do in terms of health issues and disease. For some reason, smokers get the impression that they are being discriminated against or their civil rights are being violated in some manner when the reality is, it's the non smokers who are having their rights violated. Smokers abound everywhere, walking around blowing harmful smoke into the air in public places, restaurants parks etc that non smokers frequent not to mention young children. Based on those facts alone, it is difficult to see how smokers feel so offended and picked on. Japan, like many countries, have taken counter measures and passed legislation related to automobile emissions, factory wastage disposal, chimney stack emissions and the list goes on. My point is that Japan and the rest of the free world are taking steps to decrease air pollutants and it only makes sense that cigarette emissions, that is, harmful smoke, should also be restricted and regulated.
