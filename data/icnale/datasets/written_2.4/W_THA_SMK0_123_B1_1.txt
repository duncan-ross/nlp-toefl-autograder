Everyone know that the smoking has many disadvantage for our body but in some people can't stop smoking, I don't know they are addicted to cigarettes or not So the topic about Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think we should meet half-way, banned in some place and has a restriction area to smoking because when they are smoking its will have a bad smelling and I think every people thinking like me even though the smoker is don't like when has another smoker are smoking if he doesn't smoke too because its smell. but if the smokers have a manner, the manner is they are smoking alone don't have people to smell his smoke if the smoker can't smoke I think they will not in a mood and I think if they are not in mood because can't smoking they will not going to have a meal at restaurant and the restaurant owner will lose a many customer for someone really who addicted cigarettes. Finally, I think the answer of this topic is not really banned the smoking at all but have a restriction area for smoking, if the smokers have a little manner for smoking not in restaurant but it everywhere I think we will don't have a topic to discuss about it
