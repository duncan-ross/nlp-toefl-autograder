Although many college students may find a variety of benefits in part-time work, I think that overall, college student should not have to have a part-time job and it is not that important for them. This is because most students have come to college to pursue their dream to get a college degree. Part-time work usually gets in the way of that, and most of my friends who have part-time jobs are always complaining about how stressed out they feel from work and how they feel that they have no time to do everything they want to do. Also, I very much value my social life, and if I work, I feel that I will only be able to find time to do school and work if I have no life. This is a bad image to have, and I do not want to have it, so I choose not to have a part-time job. If there are other college students like me who feel that there are other things that are more important than working, then it is obvious that it is not that important for college students to have a part-time job. Only the students who need to make money to help pay for their tuition should have a part-time job.
