After graduating from high school, many university students are confused if they are going to get a part time job. Some people might insist that college students should only focus on their academic works. However, I strongly suggest that part-time job is helping university students who should be prepared for work after graduating learn the value of money and have practical experiences. First of all, college students learn how to manage their money by having part-time jobs. After they graduate from college, they should manage their money by themselves and keep the economy of their households. University students learn how hard it is to earn money through their part-time works and try to save their money and become more independent. Therefore, it is important to get a part-time job and learn the value of money. For example, I work as a tutor in Korea and get paid. Before I get this part-time job, I was irresponsible for the money and usually spend too much on my clothing and dining as I did not know how hard it is to make money. After I work as a tutor, I do not rely on my parents for my living. Even though I have less money than I get money from my parents, I even save my money on account. In addition, part-time jobs give practical experiences for college students. Based on students' interests and majors, students can experiences their future career through part-time jobs. When we consider that university is a learning place to be prepared for their future jobs, not only studying in front of desks but also having lots of valuable and practical experiences in jobs is important for students.
