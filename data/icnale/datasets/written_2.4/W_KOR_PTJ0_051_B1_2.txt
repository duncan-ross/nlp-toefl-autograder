Many student work part time job for their pocket money, tuition or practical experience. But I have never been part time job because I strived to concentrate on my studies during the semester, I got certified during vacation for police exam. Most of people think that I really grew up pampered for that reason. On the one hand I can think like that but I feel sad about inexperienced part time job. I think that part time job is important for practical experience. Through the part time job, we can make more personal connection and feel teamwork and learn rules of courtesy towards all adults. The experience will serve to oil the wheels of social life. Some say the part time job can interfere with studies but I think that part time job for practical experience in the future is more important than studies. If I have chance, I really want to do a part time job. So I want to learn a sense of economy which is the best bang for my bucks. Besides I want to learn a way to treat another human being. And then I will be able to take a step forward for entering the workforce.
