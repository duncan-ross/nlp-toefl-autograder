Smoking is an action of taking deep breath from a cigar and exhales it. Smoking is kind of relaxing for some people. But it really annoys the non-smoker people if there are smokers beside them. In the first time when cigarette smoking was invented, people only smoke to make their body's temperature normal in the snowy place. It doesn't matter as long as smoke is not your daily needs. But, now many people smokes just to look cool, not to its function. Smoking also has many disadvantages. Some of them are that smoking may cause heart attack, stroke, impotency, pregnancy disorder, mentality/physically disorder for the babies, and many more. Smoking is also increase the spending for all heavy smokers. Imagine that a heavy smoker smokes 2 pack of cigarette a day. For example, a pack of cigarette costs around $4. So, their spending for a day is $8. In a month they spend $240 only for smoking. It is around 2 million rupiahs. In a year, they already spend $3600; it is around 36 million rupiahs. It was very costly. In the other hand, passive-smoker that doesn't smoke also gets disadvantages from smokers. The risk of getting the heart attack and other disorder is higher than the smoker itself because their body doesn't have a tolerance for the dangerous component of the cigar. As a conclusion, I agree that smoking should be banned because the disadvantages are too many and it also attacks other people.
