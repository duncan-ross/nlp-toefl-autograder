I agree with the opinion. And I have four reasons why I agree with it. First, college students have many things to do, to have to do and to buy. And money is essential for doing those things. If we have money, we can join the some parties and we can meet many interesting persons. If we have money, we can purchase a lot of books which are useful for our studying. Second, by doing a part time job, we can learn many things that we can not experience in college days, and can make friends who learn different category of study. By experiencing new things, we can see the world which I do not know, and we can do new things which I could not do. By making friends, we can share great time with them. Third, to make the place where we can spend time easily is important. If we lose place where we can spend time easily in college, part time job can be oasis. We do not have to adjust ourselves unnatural to the place where we can not be there. Forth, it is the most important, we may be meet a person who marry with me in the future. Consequently, I agree with the opinion.
