One thing I know is smoking does not do anything good to a man's body and even to the environment. Millions of people die because of different illness caused by smoking. There's lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and many other serious illnesses that can cause one's death. Stating these facts, many people still engage themselves in smoking. That's why some countries banned smoking in public places. Smoking in public places especially in restaurants is definitely a NO, NO. One, it is surrounded by many people and they may acquire second-hand smoke. Next is, there may be children in that place and it is not a good example seeing elderly smoking in front of them. Smoker might reason that they need to smoke after they eat so they can avoid having gastritis. Restaurant is a place where people eat and not for smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. It's not good for people to smell smoke because scientist and doctors says it is more dangerous that if you inhale a smoke from the smoke inhaled by another person, which is called second-hand smoke. It is said that non-smokers exposed in second-hand smoke increase their risk of lung cancer. The government of the Philippines starts banning smoking in public places. In my own opinion, smoking must be banned in restaurants and even in other public places because it affects people's health even those who are not smoking. But this will also affect the democracy of the country, people's right to choose and do whatever they want as long as they're responsible for what they're doing. But above all these, banning of smoking should start in our home. Parents should be the first one who will lecture their children that smoking is not a good practice.
