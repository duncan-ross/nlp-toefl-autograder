I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants not only in Japan but also all over the world. And in the first place I believe that tobacco do not have to be made anywhere because tobacco contain a large number of poison only. Basically those who hate anyone's smoking nearby are everywhere. Personally I dislike smoking, too. We can decrease People are made feel unpleasant by smoking. This can make by smokers' enduring smoking. Smokers can endure smoking, but those don't smoke can't get smokers not to smoke. So we need smokers' will that smokers don't cause any trouble, if smokers want smoking not to be banned at restaurant or other public space. Tobacco's smokes have a bunch of poison. And that someone smoke is the fact there are many passive smoker. This seems that smoker spread some poison. If one murders the other by poison, he must be punished. However at least there are people who caused illness or killed by passive smoking. Therefore I suppose that smokers have to be punished. So of course smoking in any restaurant must be banned. So I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
