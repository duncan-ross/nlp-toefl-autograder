I disagree that to have part-time jobs is important for college students. In my opinion, as college students should have responsibilities on developing their horizons, studying hard on their majors and putting acknowledge what they learn in use. College students are different from students in junior high and high school. College students have more time, vigor, minds and abilities to think individually. Therefore, they can make good use of their time and resources in hands to create much possibility and get many experiences in their lives instead of only emphasizing on part-time jobs. In addition, part-time jobs take too much time, and it can not meet everybody's spare time completely, so we even have to sacrifice our free time for studying or doing something meaningful. Waste too much time and energy on part-time jobs might miss many things except for earning money. If college students wanted to take part-time jobs and studied very well simultaneously, it should have been an important issue for students. Entering to a college means a new stage to everyone. There are many resources in colleges that can be used. We should absorb acknowledge as possible as we can, so that we can appeal the things. We learn to repay for the society. If we were not able to find balance between part time jobs and studies, we might have lost both and even got no success.
