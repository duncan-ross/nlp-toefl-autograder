Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. To be even more audacious, I believe that smoking should be abolished from this planet. After all, smoking has no benefits to the human body, besides giving one a temporary relief from stress, which can be eased through other means. The only benefit smoking have for the world, is only an economical one, whereby the demand for cigarettes fuels jobs and trade. Yet, these economic benefits are negated by the medical fees one pays after develop lung cancer and various health complications smoking brings. Not only that, the death and psychological suffering that comes with the health implications is immeasurable. I would confidently say that the world will be a better place if smoking is abolished and permanently extinguished from our planet. Although the immediate implications would be a sudden loss of jobs and possible chaos in countries that specialize in trade of cigarettes, I firmly believe that the long term impacts will be positive. That being said, the answer to whether smoking should be completely banned in restaurants, is obvious. Smoking in restaurant not only irritates other customers and reflect bad social consciousness, it also brings great health implications to others. I believe the no greater emphasis has been placed on the dangers of secondhand smoke and everyone is well aware of it. To continue smoking in public and even at home only goes to reveal the selfishness of the individual, to put everyone around him/her at risks. It does not matter why one picked up smoking. What matters is the will to stop and to respect one's own body and other's around them.
