In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It has been proved that second-hand smoking will cause lung cancer easier than someone who smokes. Usually, restaurants are indoor space. If someone smokes in the restaurants, most people there will get the second-hand smoke easily. It is not fair to people who do not smoke, because they take more risk of lung cancer than people who smoke. And the smell of it is really bad. Someone who smokes has a very heavy smell of smoking on him or her. When you walk by him or her, you will smell it and feel bad on him or her. For example, I have a friend who smokes. But before her smoke I think he is a good girl, and like to get along with her. Someday I smell a weird smell on her so I asked her what was that smell and she told me that she smokes. Even though we are still friends now, I will not want to get to close to her when she has the smoking smell on her. Smoking will make others have different opinions about you, and it is always bad opinion. So smoking should be banned not only at all the restaurants but also in all public places.
