Recently, whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country has become a heated topic. Though many people are strongly against it, I stand for it firmly. To begin with, there is no need to smoke at restaurant. A large amount of people smoke only to make them calm and keep their brain work efficiently, thus they have no excuse to smoke at a restaurant without any work to do. As for those who are addicted to cigarettes, it is absolutely possible to get rid of cigarette for a few moments. Furthermore, the non-smokers' rights should be protected. The second-hand smoking is greatly influenced us, especially in public places like restaurants. It's unfair to force non-smokers breathe the air polluted by cigarettes and suffer the pain brought by second-hand smoking. In addition, the ban on smoking at all the restaurants helps reduce the number of smokers. In China, people show respects by offering cigarettes to others and it's undeniable that a large amount of people learn how to smoke at the restaurant. The ban will decrease the number of smokers undoubtedly. To conclude, no easy solution can be at hand to solve the problem of smoking, but the ban on smoking at the restaurant might be the first step towards change in the right direction.
