What do you think about Prohibiting smoking in Thailand restaurants? In Thailand, many restaurants have an important rule. One is prohibiting smoking. Because the good restaurants should have good vistas for service customers and save customers' health. In my opinion, I agree with a rule of smoking prohibit in all restaurants in Thailand. I think there are three important reasons to enforce this rule. First, this rule makes all restaurants in Thailand have International standard. If every restaurants use this rule strictly, it makes customers impress in good vistas because there is not have bad smells in restaurants areas. These stimulate the customers' appetite and make customers want to come back again. Second, this rule can save customers' health. Because smoking is a risk habit. In addition, in cigarettes have Nicotine. It can make smoker health goes bad. Furthermore, it affect around people's health. It is a main cause of lung cancer, makes smoker's mouth have bad smell, and grow old quickly. Finally, if the restaurants use this rule, they can be good patterns for children who come to restaurants. In conclusion, there are many disadvantages about smoking in restaurant areas. So, I hope you agree that Thailand should have a rule of prohibiting smoking in restaurants with me.
