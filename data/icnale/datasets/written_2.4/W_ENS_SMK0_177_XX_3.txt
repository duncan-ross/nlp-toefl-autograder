I agree and would support bans of this nature anywhere. The question is would the Japanese Government be prepared to back it up if they were to introduce a restaurant ban on smoking? The reason that I ask, is that there is sure to be some sort of uproar from the huge smoking population that Japan has. If the government were to prohibit smoking in restaurants, how would they police and enforce it? There is no doubt in my mind that bans of this nature help to protect other restaurant goers. But I wonder whether or not the government would back down if enough citizens protested on this particular issue? Even though ninety-nine percent of the free world knows and accepts the dangers of smoking and passive smoking, there are some who still shed a tear or have some sympathy for the smokers. Maybe they are friends of theirs or relatives, I have no idea but the bottom line is that we must all keep the greater good of all in mind and sometimes it is necessary to make tough decisions that will be far from popular. It is important that we stand fast when we know what is in the best interests of the majority.
