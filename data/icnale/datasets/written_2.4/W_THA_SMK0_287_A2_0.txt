Yes. I really agree because I'm not smoke. The cigarette is very bad for everyone and I hate it. Who is smoke at every where I never like them. Some people think about smoking is good and make them feel good when they have a problem and headache. However the smoking never give a good health for everyone but the smoker is up level to high number all mount all year. In the past when I do to the club or everywhere I feel bad because smoker was smoke a cigarette but now smoker not smoke at the park, restaurant or everywhere. The law of smoking say who is smoke at the place of non smoking will pay a money for penalty at police station. I think the smoker who is smoke at the not smoking place have to get a lot of money. The cigarette is a bad thing. The cigarette can not get a money from me. Some friend of me smoke and when who is smoke I will go far away from its because of the tobacco smoke is smell very bad. I hate the tobacco smoke and who is smoke at everywhere. I hope in the future every body will not smoke.
