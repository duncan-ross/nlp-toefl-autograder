I agree with this opinion. Because the part−time job is the chance to experience the real work. After we finished the causes of the college, we have to work in community. Then, if we don't know anything about the rules or how to behave in the communities, we must make many mistakes. When we are college students we study our own fields to get the jobs of it. But only the skills of the field, we can't use it in work. We need a lot of other abilities. For example, if we can't communicate with others, we can't express our opinion—even if it was great one. When we are college students, we have a lot of free time too. This is not only for playing but also for bringing up us. How to bring up? Talking with friends, going abroad, finding the great teacher or sometimes thinking of myself. In any way, we can get the things that help us to grow up. I think the part−time job is one of them. Through working in communities, we can learn how to solve problems, how to present our ideas, and so on---. They are important not only in the office but also in whole the life. So, the part−time job is important for college students.
