 Speaking of the topic whether college students should take part time job, opinions are often divided. Some people believe that students should focus on their study, while others feel that taking a part time job is necessary. As far as I am concerned, I prefer the latter. I can raise examples to support my viewpoint. To begin with, taking a part time job enables us to get a main idea of the society. We will leave our schools and walk into the society sooner or later. By that time, what we need is not only the knowledge, but also the skills and manners. Undoubtedly, the experience of doing a part time job will help us be familiar with these manners. Then we can sail through the ups and downs during our career life. Furthermore, doing a part time job is good to our study. Only learning the knowledge is far from enough, we also need practice. There is no doubt that doing a part time job is a great way for us to apply our knowledge to practice. Then we can get an idea of what we are short of, which can help us study better. Last but not least, doing a part time can form the sense of independent and perseverance, which is also of great importance to us. All in all, it is essential for college students to take a part time job. It does good to both ourselves and our job in the future.
