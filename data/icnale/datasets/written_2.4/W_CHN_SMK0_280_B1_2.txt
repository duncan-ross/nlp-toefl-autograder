I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is generally believed that smoking does a great harm to our health. So it is really a very good choice if it is banned in most parts of the restaurant. But I also do believe that since it is really hard to get rid of smoking, we should at least show a little respect to the smokers and allow them to smoke in certain parts of the restaurants. Maybe we could find a small room as a specific smoking room and allow them to have a smoke there. Anyway, they are not having drugs. Although it does harm to others, we can not deprive them form their fundamental human rights. Simply find a little space for them and all the problems could be solved. Another problem is the possibility of putting a ban on smoking everywhere. On the one hand, with millions of people now smoking in China, it could be a difficult goal to achieve. We can not put a cop in every restaurant. On the other hand, it has no real meaning if we could really achieve this goal. Although people no longer smoke in the restaurant, can we guarantee that they would not pick up a cigarette again on the street or in their own homes. These behaviors could also do harm to people's health. However, we couldn't have an eye on them under these circumstances. So, generally speaking, I don't think that it is a good idea to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. What we should do is to uses some other measures to tell people that smoking harms. These measures could only work when people get to know the harm and are willing to stop smoking by themselves.
