Smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazard. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous to people with pre-existing conditions. As of 2010, legislation across the United States has banned smoking in restaurants to protect restaurant workers and non-smoking patrons. Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke leads to long-term ill health effects. Those who inhale second-hand smoke on a regular basis have the same risks as smokers. These include cancer, heart disease and emphysema. Restaurant workers in businesses that allow smoking showed detectable levels of NNK. NNK is a carcinogen in cigarettes that has been directly linked to the development of lung cancer. In 2004, the University of California conducted a study, which found the banning of smoking reduced heart attacks by as much as one-fifth. Finland also has a ban on smoking in restaurants and a study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health found the number of sick days in the workplace was reduced by thousands. A proposed ban on smoking in restaurants, bars and cafés has spurred a debate about how the economic consequences will weigh out, as those against the ban caution that bars and restaurants, as well as state revenue, will suffer if fewer people buy cigarettes, while supporters of the ban say the overall improved health of citizens will make up for any losses. Banning smoking in restaurants has thus proven an excellent measure for keeping clean various pipes in musical instruments as well as in humans
