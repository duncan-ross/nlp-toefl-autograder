Many students work at a part time job to earn their school fee or living money. So it is pouring in the part time job to working students. But some people see this situation as bad. Because they worried that the students would not study for working. Although there are some concerns, I think that working at a part time job when we are students has a lot of advantages. First, we can get the independence from making some money themselves. Most of students tend to depend on their parents although they become adults. And parents support their children excessively. It is bad action not help to their children. They also must grow independence as an adult. And it can be improved from working at a part time job. Second, we can get the economic sense. We cannot notice that earning the money is not easy if we have never worked directly. In that, we need to work to grow the economic sense. Most of the parents say to their children like that. Don't use the money carelessly. This money is not given for nothing. But if we work at a part time job when we are student, they can this wisdom of life deeply. Finally, we can become faithful person. Many part time job need a faithful person and sincere person. So while working at a part time job, we can learn the character like that. Such as faith and sincerity are important to work and also study. So working at a part time job is so helpful. We can get lots of good things from working at a part time job. I agree that working at a part time job has much advantages to students.
