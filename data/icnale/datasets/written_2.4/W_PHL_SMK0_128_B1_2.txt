Smoking has been a popular means of feeling good among many people today. Often if not, people get used to smoking in almost an place they go to. This includes public places, such as restaurants. Smoking people tend to forget about the other people around them. They tend to be apathetic to the reactions of others towards such an act. Sometimes, they don't understand that the people around them vary in age, and therefore somehow allow the elderly, and even the youngest of children (including infants or babies) to do indirect second-hand smoking. This has been a common conflict among many in public places, restaurants in particular. While people are happily eating out with their families, or even the whole clan, still others prefer to smoke. This should not be. These people do not have the right to disrupt the happiness and meriment of hungry people and families around them, causing to ultimately hurting them indirectly as well.
