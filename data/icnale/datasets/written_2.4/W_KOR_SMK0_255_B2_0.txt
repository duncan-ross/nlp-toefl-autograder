Smoking should not be permitted at any restaurants in the country, as smoking harms both not only smokers themselves but also those who are surrounding them. Although some people say that smokers have the freedom to choose what they want to do, it is important to keep in mind that one's freedom cannot be more important than other people's rights to protect their health. To explain, studies show that second-hand smoking is more dangerous than direct smoking. Even though public places have different spaces for smokers and non-smokers, smoke containing such harmful chemicals as nicotine is highly likely to reach non-smoker's areas as well. Undoubtedly, the smoke will be inhaled by non-smokers and irritate their feelings. More importantly, compared with other public spaces, smoke plays an undesirable role especially in restaurants. This is because it ruins the food that they are eating. Additionally, a restaurant is not only for adults but also children, who are more vulnerable to smoke. This kind of situation is totally unfair and unjust, regarding the fact that non-smokers paid to intake good food in a sympathetic environment. Therefore, as the saying goes, freedom without responsibility is licence, it is imperative to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country.
