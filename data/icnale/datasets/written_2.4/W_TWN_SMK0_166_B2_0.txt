In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of following reasons. First, it is quite annoying to have disgusting smell caused by cigarettes when eating and it may as a result of destroying customers' appetite and feelings when eating out. Besides, food in restaurants may be covered by dangerous smoke and may not be clean any more when there is someone smoking there. In addition, it is not respectful to those who don't smoke but under attack by second-hand smoke, which may do harm to their health and cause big problems to them. Last but not the least, no matter you smoke or not, it is extremely harmful to human beings when smell the smoke created by cigarettes and eat unclean food which was covered by the smoke, and it has unexpected effects on our health like cancer, high blood pressure, and other diseases. As a result, based on those reasons and disadvantages when being exposed of the smoke created by cigarette, I strongly recommend that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is even better that smoking should be completely banned in all the places in the country.
