To completely ban smoking in every restaurants in the country is a na?ve idea since it will be met with many oppositions from the smokers. It may be ideal for the society if this can be achieved but this is most likely agreed to only by non-smokers. As a non-smoker, I agree that smoking by other people causes disturbance as the air feels suffocating with a smoker nearby. However, since smoking is a kind of relaxation activity or even a need for most smoker, I do not think that it is fair to remove the rights for someone to do something if it does not cause direct harm on another. With that said, smokers should be considerate enough to not smoke in enclosed areas since the discomfort on the non-smokers is amplified. The ban of smoking in air conditioned areas is a more feasible and ideal one where smokers are still able to smoke when they are in open areas and non-smokers do not have to worry about the quality of air when they are in enclosed areas. Instead of banning smoking in every restaurant, another more effective way to tackle this issue is perhaps to discourage smoking by organising campaigns to encourage people to quit smoking.
