Stereotypically, the identity of college students is usually separate from that of a job-holder. Yet, in today's increasingly multi-faceted society, the distinction between the two identities have gradually blurred. While it is not uncommon these days for college students to simultaneously hold jobs, and vice versa, it does not necessarily equate to importance. If that had been the case, almost all college students, being of supposedly higher intellectual abilities, would be holding part-time jobs. Nevertheless, it can be somewhat considered important depending on individuals' needs, and those holding a part-time job do it for many reasons. Some do it for the money. Not every student has the intellectual capability to be offered scholarships or the financial capacity to pay for college fees and still be able to provide for their daily needs. Therefore, a part-time job will help bridge this gap and it may be essential to this group. Others do it for the experience. In Singapore's highly competitive environment, many college students feel that by taking on part-time jobs, they have an added advantage of understanding the corporate world better or even have an extra edge in their curriculum vitae. However, it is more of an optional choice rather than necessity.
