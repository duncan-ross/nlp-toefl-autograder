I agree with this topic the most, because restaurant is one of the places where build some happiness for many families. So it should not have any smoking from cigarette in every restaurant. For my reasons that I agree with this topic : The first one is, everybody well know the smoking is one of the causes of diseases, such as lung cancer, bad smelling mouth, etc but why many people still take it. The next one, I am sure everyone knows disadvantages of smoke and does not anybody would like to sit or stand among grey or black smoke, Do you agree with me?. So Smoking which makes the bad atmosphere should be completely banned at all in the restaurants. For the most important reason that I would like you to banned smoking in restaurant is: Do you know restaurant is the place where give you some happiness, if you are atmosphere destroyer, you will make other people unhappy in dinner and you will be bad person in other people eyes. Due to, there are many diseases from smoking, I would like you to decide smoking is good or bad for you. Whenever you know what your best answer is, I am sure that it will change your life to become better.
