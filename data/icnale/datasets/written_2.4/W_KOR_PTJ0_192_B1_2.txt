I agree this statement. Of course, No student has to have a part-time job, but I think a part-time job is important. Especially, if it is a college student, that's good for pre-experience about society before, they graduate school and work for company or something. It's not necessary but it can be sufficient condition. Also, a part-time job gives different experience. It reminds to Communication between person and person, worth about money, and etc. However, a part-time job is necessity stuff for person who needs money. I heard about US, people in US, they have to have a part-time job when they 18 years old. Because their parents want to give some importance about money to them. I actually, do not have any part-time job now. But I did, I've had and felt importance about money and appreciation for my parents. Of course, I met worst and good people in the world and I felt this world is never easy to live. But because of that experience, I could live in the wild world. It's so rough and dangerous and also not easy, but these experiences will make us stronger. That's the reason I think a part-time job is good for student, especially for college students.
