I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. Smokers would disagree for sure. They might think that not allowing them to smoke is invasion of their rights or freedom. It is true that smoking is personal matter and any one can freely smoke. However, freedom only can be justified when it doesn't invade others' freedom. It doesn't matter that people smoke their houses or their own rooms. In this case smoking doesn't make problem with others who don't want to smell smoke. However, restaurants are public space. There might be pregnant women, sick people, old people or children in there. To these people, smoke can be fatal for health. Except them, there can be other people who don't like the smell of smoking. If smokers smoke at the restaurant ignoring others, they invade others' freedom and rights. All the people at the restaurant have rights to eat happily without any other interruption. It means that not only smokers who have rights to freely smoke but also non-smokers have their rights to keep themselves away and protect their health from smoking as well. Every person is free to do what they want to do, but their deeds can be justified only when all others' rights are equally respected at the same time.
