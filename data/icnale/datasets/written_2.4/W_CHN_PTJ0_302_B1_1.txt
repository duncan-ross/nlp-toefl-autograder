Is it important for college students to get a part-time job? When entering college, we find that there are many chances to get a part-time job. Some are simple like waiters, and some are more professional like tutors. In my opinion, for students who have difficulty to pay for their tuition fee it is surely important; but for the others, it may not be important. Firstly, learning in college is not as relaxing as people describe. We need much time to obtain knowledge include both in major and in common. When we get a part time job, we must reduce our learning time to work, thus causing a lack of time to study. On one hand, some students' score fall, and some students even fail in the exam. On the other hand, students are always busy in both sides, and always lack of sleep and relax. According to a survey, almost every student who has a part time job has difficulty balancing their learning and working time, and some admit that the job surely has bad impact on their study. In addition, we can find these jobs are simple and mechanical instead of challenging and fun said by others. That means, we may give our precious time and labour force to the boss, but not really get improved through doing these jobs. If we spend the time and energy on our campus life, we may learn more things, not only essential knowledge but also live experience. As college students, we should know that our duty is to gain more academic knowledge and make a difference in our field. So, a part-time job is not as important as that. Only when we become an excellent graduate from college, can we find a real good job and improve ourselves in society.
