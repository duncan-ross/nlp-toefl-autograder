 I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, college students have grown up to be adults, having a part-time job means that they can make money to support themselves. Although the money is just part of their living expense; it is a symbol of independence. So I think it is necessary. Besides, during the process, they will get more experience, which can improve their poor social knowledge. And they have to meet kinds of people including the kind and the bad, the young and the old. Then they are sure to know what means communication and cooperation. They aren't the center in the society any more, which is not the same as living at home. They'll learn tolerance and acceptance gradually. What's more, they can acknowledge teamwork deeply. And teamwork is what they must face after they graduate. What's more, they can know their disadvantages only if they have done work actually. They will try to use what they learn in practice, and transform the theory to reality gradually. Certainly, there is a premise that part-time job shouldn't affect their study. In a word, I am in favor that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
