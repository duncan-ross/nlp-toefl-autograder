I completely without any doubts agree to the suggestion. There are more and more nations prohibit smoking at all the indoor places no need to mention in the restaurants. Their have been so many scientific researches pointed out that second handed smoking can causes the death especially to who have pregnancy. Furthermore, healthy people who had second handed smoking are even more dangerous than people who smoke. The toxic of the cigarette might cause early-born baby or even a death baby. People in the restaurant might feel mentally or physically uncomfortable annoyed by smoking smell during the eating process. For me, people who smoke inside the restaurant are very rude and impolite. They are the type of selfish and careless people who only cares about themselves. Therefore I suggest governments in the world that they supposed to raise the tax of the cigarette and the fine of the banned smoking because of that people who smoke increase the cost of societies. I do believe that some people quit smoking due to the high cost of the cigarette. At the same time, governments need to promote more "no smoking" all over the indoor places. Interest groups do help at this area. Take Taiwan for example, interest group always invited popular stars or good reputation celebrities to promote "no smoking. "
