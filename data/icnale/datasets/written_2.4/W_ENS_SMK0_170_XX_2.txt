I do not agree and instead of bans, how about displaying a little tolerance. We hear the word'tolerance' bandied about quite a lot from politicians talking about cultural awareness and immigrant integration, to parents instructing their children to be tolerant of everything and everyone except, drug addicts, axe murderers and smokers. What? You mean smokers too? Yes, that is exactly who I mean. It seems that tolerance is subjective, and left up to the personal bias of the individual. Has it come down to smokers being lumped together with known fiends and enemies of decent society? It would appear so, when one listens to some of the illogical, nonsensical arguments put forward by hysterical non-smoking groups. It really is ludicrous at times, in particular when they state that smoking can cause cancer, which I am not disputing, but I would like to point out that medical research has discovered that dangerous chemicals caused by barbecuing certain foods, can also lead to cancer as do fluorescent light tubes, if we believe the research put forward by one particular group of researchers. Should the Japanese government ban barbecues too? Or perhaps just prohibit barbecuing within one hundred meters of human beings. Now there is a thought, remote barbecuing.
