Many people say that students focus on study reasonably. Instead of earning by part time job they say to get scholarship. However, my thinking is different. Part time job during school days can not only help a person much financially but also develop oneself. First, it can help students in financial difficulty. Nowadays college tuition is very expensive and there are many students who can't pay tuition. Scholarship is limited to the minority and very difficult to get. Even if it's received, what you can do for living expenses? Doing a part time job for 3-4 hours a day after class can make us earn a monthly living cost. It helps to the financially difficult students and those who want to earn pocket money. Second, it can give experience that can't be bought by money. In fact, I've done part time job during last school days. Although it was difficult, it was worthwhile. Many people told me, ""You become sensible. "" As such, it can give lots of experiences while meeting various people. It makes me look back upon selfish mind and hold the heart of caring others. Doing a part time job should be experienced as a college student, I think. People in the countries such as USA, Canada and England become independent after entering college. They are so independent that they pay for tuition and living with their earning. Therefore, we are to abandon prejudice, ""Students should study only. "" Doing part time job helps student for self development and independence growth.
