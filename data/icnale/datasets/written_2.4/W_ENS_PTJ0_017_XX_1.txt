Although some people think that having a part-time job in college is very important, I personally think that a student should focus more of their time on studying. I don't really know how anyone finds time to do anything else other than study, try to get some sleep, and hang out with their friends. Most of us are lucky enough to have scholarships or have our parents help us by paying for school, so in order to return the favor we should do our very best to do well in school. There will be plenty of time after graduating to learn about working and to actually work, so I think we should spend these last few years over time as "children" having fun and only being serious when it comes to school. The only reason anyone would really have a part-time job is to make money so they can go out at night and party with their friends. However, most of us had jobs in high school, and we should have saved up enough money to entertain ourselves through college. If I ever did run out of money, I guess I would get a part-time job, but I don't think that it is that important for college students to have one.
