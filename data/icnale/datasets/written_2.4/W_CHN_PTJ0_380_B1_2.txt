 Nowadays it is common to see that more and more college students take a part-time job in their spare time. At the same time, it causes people from all walks of life to heatedly debate over whether the phenomenon is a blessing or a curse. However, in my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job for three reason. To begin with, it is a good method to accumulate the work experience in order to prepare for job-hunting after graduation. In the contemporary university, many students are grumbling that they are lack of the opportunity of practical work. Therefore, they take a part-time job and seize the chance to know more about how the company works and how to survive harsh competitions. During the work they confront a great number of challenges and their abilities will be improved. Moreover, part-time jobs can alleviate financial burdens on parents and promote them to manage the money. Currently it is inevitable for students to spend money in many ways to keep daily life and they also don't want to aggravate the burden on their parents, so they get the pays through part-time jobs. Additionally, they come to learn to balance income and expenses by themselves. In addition, many students can apply knowledge to practice through part-time job. For example, some students majoring in Japanese tend to seek the work related to Japanese, such as Japanese tutors, Japanese interpreters. It is a good chance for them to challenge and make further progress. Based on the three forceful reason, I believe part-time job is important for college students. Although it brings a lot of benefits, I still suggest that college students should balance study time and work time.
