I agree this essay. I agree that people can't smoke at all the restaurants in the country. Although smoking is only one thing, it is between all people who live on the earth. So it means this is not one person's thing. If you don't care your health, it is okay, you enjoy the feeling that taking a smoke after meal makes you feel happy and free like a fairy, it is okay, you can smoke alone. Because one person smokes that is bad for everyone. Everyone feels uncomfortable because of only you; you must feel guilty for those people you hurt. I also consider that smoking should be banned in a public place besides at all the restaurants in country. There are many disadvantages for smoking. For example, girls smoke that are not very charming, smoking causes bad breathe that influence other people around you, smoking can hurt your lung that causes your family and friends worry about you, and it also causes air pollution. If you have kids, they may hate you. Because you can't be a healthy father or mother by their side. Don't smoking in a public place, because you hurt your health and others. Don't smoking is the best for everything.
