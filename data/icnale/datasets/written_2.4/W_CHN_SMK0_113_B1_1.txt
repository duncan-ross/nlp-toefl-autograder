Have you ever found that: when you have a dinner at a restaurant, you may see someone is smoking as if there are no other people around them? It is a common phenomenon in our society. And the question is that: shall we ban smoking at all the restaurant in the country?As for me, I don't think banning smoking in all restaurants is a good idea. We should give the right to the restaurant itself to make the decision. To begin with, banning smoking may hurt the restaurant's profit. If the restaurant bans smoking, it would make some customer who has a habit of smoking away from the restaurant, which will reduce its income. For some restaurants, if they have the single room for the customer, they can permit them smoke but not affect others. Then, this policy may influence people who have a habit of smoking. If all the restaurants ban smoking in the country, where can they have dinner? Absolutely, this will annoy many people. Last but not the least, I think it is not a feasible way to make this policy. The country is so large that we cannot make it practical to all of the restaurants. In general, I suggest that some of the restaurant should ban smoking; however, the other can permit smoking in the restaurant.
