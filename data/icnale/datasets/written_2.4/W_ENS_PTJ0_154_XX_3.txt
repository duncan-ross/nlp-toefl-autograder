I agree that it is important. Students quite often think that everything should just be given to them on a sliver platter. Especially the ones that do not have to pay for tuition because it is being paid for by their parents. Having a part-time job would teach them that they have to do some work to get paid and that when they enter a company, their company expects them to do good work and perform their jobs correctly in order to keep their jobs. This would teach them some kind of work ethic and to have some responsibility. They would soon come to understand that they have to do this consistently and therefore, have some discipline and pride in the work that they do. If they don't do a good job, they will get fired and that is just the way it is. Having a part-time job while they are still at college will get them started on the right track towards keeping a full-time job when they get their degrees. If they get fired while they are still at college then it won't be as bad as getting fired from a full-time job and they can learn from the experience, continue their studies and move on.
