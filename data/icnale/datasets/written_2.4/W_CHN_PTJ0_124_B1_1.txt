With the increasing pressure of the difficulty in looking for a good job, more and more college students choose a part-time job as a way of adapting to the society earlier and easier. It's also a controversial topic whether we should have a part-time job or center on the knowledge taught in the college. However, as far as I'm concerned, one coin has two sides, but it's vital or us to get some experience before stepping into the colorful stage of society. At first, the knowledge from the books is very limited and it's very hard to put the theory into practice just in the campus. Putting what you learn into reality is the symbol of absorbing the knowledge fully. Besides, part-time job gives us a great opportunity to contact the people from all walks of life. A good interpersonal relationship also plays a very important role in our career. Last but not least, part-time job is a job we can earn some money from. This may not be the most important, but the salary we earn by ourselves can give us a sense of treasuring the money earned by hard work. What we give equals to what we get. To sum up, part-time job is a good way to get more social experience; we college students should attach more importance to it no matter what you want to get from it. If you want to be superior to others after the college, just have a try in advance.
