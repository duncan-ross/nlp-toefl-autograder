I think that college people have to have a part-time job, but they have it for vacation only. Because most of student are using parents money usually. I mean parents invest money for our future or dream. Therefore, in the vacation, we make A pocket money for rewarding a favor. Of course, if your parents don't pay tuition financially, you have to have a part-time job in the term-time. But if you are not in that situation, I would like to recommend concentrating study in the term-time. If we don't focus on studying, We would not have a good grade. After all, we don't have a good job. It is not good way. It just recycles the bed situation. It is not only way to make a money. For instance, you study hard in the term-time; you will get scholarship from university. And, you can have a part-time job for weekend. And your routine life, you save money. Don't waste your money. I mean that the part-time job doesn't disturb your future or dream and many ways is exist to reduce a pressure for your parents. After all, in my opinion, college student's part time job is an option for vacation. If you have a worrisome for parents, you have to take a good job, and pay back parent's investment. In the term-time, college student have a right to study hard.
