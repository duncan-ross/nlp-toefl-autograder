There is an ongoing debate in countries all over the world about banning smoking, passive smoking and whether or not smoking should be banned in public places as well as restaurants. Many countries have already adopted smoking bans in bars, pubs, nightclubs, certain government buildings, bus stops, cab ranks and train stations. So, why not in restaurants? I have noticed that on several department stores, food floors in Tokyo, that smoking is either banned completely or restricted to certain hours. There is nothing worse than sitting down in a restaurant, expecting to enjoy a delicious meal, only to find that the place smells like an ashtray which messes the dining experience with every bite. Japan's Government needs to think more about people's health rather than the number of voters and ban smoking in restaurants, all public buildings and entrances and also, all public transport. People are dying every year from smoking or inhaling smoke fumes and this is completely preventable. It's up to the government to pass irrevocable laws that support this prevention and not be concerned about public opinion in this case because there can be no argument, smoking kills directly and indirectly without question. The government should display strong leadership and give a clear indication to the people that smoking will not be allowed or tolerated in places that can be harmful to people who don't smoke, around children, old people and hospitals.
