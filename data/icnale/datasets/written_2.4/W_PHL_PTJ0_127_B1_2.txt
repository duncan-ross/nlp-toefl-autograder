For me it's not important for a college student to have a part time job. Nowadays, there are more and more students choose to have a part-time job in the spare time. Surely, a part-time job can provide cash and working experience to them. They are called student for them to study not to work. So we should grab all the opportunities that we are given the chance to study and learn many things. That our parents work so hard just to provide us the best education. But not all of us have a good condition of living; some is suffering from financial problems. A person who really wants to study will find ways to support their studies, just like by having a part time job. Having a part time job has also a good effect for a student, because it prepares them to the real world after studying. Besides, a part-time job would occupy college students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn systematic knowledge and living skills in class without worries of work stress and frustration. Also the college students provide a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education.
