Part-time jobs now a days are very common to students who needs financial help, most of the part-time working students are in the college level because college is very expensive and sometimes students cannot reach the academic standards of the college/university scholarship so they either have to stop college or work part-time for their tuition fees and academic expenses. but for those who are scholars who are studying but still need academic expenses work part-time in some fast foodchains with minimum wage. In some colleges/universities offers financial help for those who are in need its either they get a sponsor or they work on campus such as a library assistant and they're given a minimum wage and it shows that they are often more responsible because they support their our expenses daily and academically. A student working part-time has lots of work loads and responsibilities like working for their food for the next day and at the same time make a midterm plate for their majors subjects and study for the written midterm examination of their minor subjects and they earn their own money for their school expenses. And there for if you not that responsible and you have a part-time job its better to earn money for future academic expenses and it will help you learn to be more responsible.
