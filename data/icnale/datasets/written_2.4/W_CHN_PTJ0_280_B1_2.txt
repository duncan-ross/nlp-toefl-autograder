 I think it is very important for students to have a part-time job. Most of the college students are more than 18 years old which means they are now adults and are old enough to earn their pocket money. A part-time job means more than money itself. It enables us to learn more about the society and to have a step further into the real world. While doing the part-time job, we can know more about the hardship of our parents. We can then know that we should be more considerate to them and should not act like a little princess anymore. We could also choose a part-time job in the field that we are interested in and thus know more about how it works. Apart from these aspects, having a part-time job could also lay a very good foundation for our future career. We can have the experience of doing the work ahead of schedule so that when we graduate from school and enter the job market, we could tell our employer that we already had a sample of these areas. Having a part-time job is a good supplement of our dubious college life. Wouldn't it be interesting if we have a chance to get out of campus in our leisure time and get to know more people and learn more about the real world? To learn knowledge is not the only thing that we should do in campus. I think that to further enhance our social ability is as important as knowledge learning itself. Last but not the least, it is certainly true that having a part-time job could make us more endurable and yet have a strong will to achieve further success. So, I really think that it is a very good idea for students to have a part-time job.
