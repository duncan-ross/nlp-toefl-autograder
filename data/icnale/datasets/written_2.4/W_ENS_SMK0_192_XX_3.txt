I agree and just wonder why it has taken Japan so long to apply such an ordinary rule? It is blatantly obvious that restaurants and their customers in Japan have pretty much just been happy enough to allow this situation to go nowhere except worsen. The apathy that has been displayed by all parties is pretty pathetic really and I think that since it hasn't been resolved in so long yet, a large portion of the rest of the world has moved forward with this already, doesn't speak very highly for the leadership. This should not be a negotiation or compromise situations, there is nothing to compromise on. Cigarette deaths and connected diseases are killing thousands every year. The highest medical authorities in the world have all concurred that smoking is killing people at an alarming rate yet is increasing year by year. I would say that the time to introduce bans would have been when the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that this was what was happening. I mean that this is not a theory these are hard core facts so I think that it is time Japan got off there behinds and became more proactive in their efforts.
