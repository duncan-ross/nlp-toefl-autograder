I do not agree the following statement which is that Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Also, l would like to give some reasons to support my point. First, banning smoking at all restaurants can move smoking elsewhere. Bans on smoking in offices and other enclosed public places often result in smokers going outside to smoke, frequently congregating outside doorways. Many jurisdictions that have banned smoking in enclosed public places have extended the ban to cover areas within a fixed distance of entrances to buildings Second, businesses affected by smoking bans have filed lawsuits claiming that bans are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. Some cite unequal protection under the law while others cite loss of business without compensation, as well as other types of challenges. Third, it is a complete infringement on the peoples' constitutional rights because smokers have their own right to do anything in everywhere. Banning smoking at restaurants will seriously damage smokers' personal right and it is unfair to smokers. Fourth, banning smoking at all restaurant will decrease the revenue of restaurants because that motion will decrease the number of smokers to go to restaurant, which is non-smoking place. Smokers may not find somewhere that can eat and smoke. All in all, banning smoking is not suitable to all restaurants and may bring trouble to restaurants' owner, smoker and non-smokers.
