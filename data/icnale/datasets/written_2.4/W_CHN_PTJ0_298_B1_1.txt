Nowadays, more and more college students are fond of finding a part-time job in their spare time. Since I graduated from high school entered university, I have found we usually have so much spare time after finishing homework and reviewing the books. Unfortunately most of college students are used to spending their valuable young time in playing computer games, watching TV and other things. Of course, there are a few students still working hard at their study. On the whole, if we can't grab the gold time we may miss the best opportunity in our life. What we can do in our spare time? There are so many choices we can do. Such as do something we are interested in and good for us, taking part in some voluntary activities and so on. But I think what most of us will choose is a part-time job. Some sorts of part-time jobs can help us learn more about native custom and lifestyle, such as a home teacher. Because when we go to native a family to help a middle school student, we will get a chance to communicate with the family member, by this, to some degree. help us to learn about their life. Another good way is to find a job that is connected with our major. Thus we can review our knowledge and master it more firmly. The most important is we can form our interest in our major. By doing a part-time job, we even can lower our family's load and make us more independent. So I think doing a part-time job is so good for us.
