Everyone does know that smoking is more dangerous in receiver than who is smoking. Also in the restaurant, have you ever had a dinner and see a person smoking? It is so unhappy to eat, right? Many people want to smoke when they just finish eating, so there is so much smoke in the restaurant. I think smoking shouldn't be completely banned. Otherwise, almost people who like smoking would have another drug to take. I think it should have another room for people who want to eat and smoke in the same time. Then, it can divide the people into three groups, who don't want to receive smoke, who can receive smoke, and who smoke. The another way is to have some tubes nearby a table for releasing pollution when they want to smoke. I think many people adducted in cigar or others should think that they are making a pollution that can kill other people even if kill their parents or their lover. Smoking is a danger that injures people both physical side and mental side. So, smoker should think to another person that doesn't want to receive smoke too. The better way is smoking when you are alone I think.
