Agree, because working students earn for extra income and It also helps reduce costs for parents. And also build Good conscience. Learn save the money and of their own money to be used is required or what I have without having to interfere with parents. Some universities have a very high cost. This is difficult for parents. Therefore working during their studies and no effect on learning considered a benefit for students on campus. And also the students learn about discrimination at work and time manually. About self-care. Manage your life. Create their own leadership. Decide for yourself. And use free time to be useful. Because the current study at university requires a lot of money. And some students spend much money And to work are not honest. Therefore, jobs for students are considered revenue to the students another way by which students can not go wrong career. Therefore Topics "it is important for college students to have a part-time job. " Strongly agreed that it be provided or students during class work together with the need not to affect learning for students. And the third vehicle to help students. To have a job and money, along with learning. Dang it, Learning to work together. Is a good thing.
