Smoking cannot and should not be completely banned from all restaurants in the country. While many argue that smoking is harmful for one's health and the health of those around him or her, smoking has become a part of society and even culture for some. Keeping in mind that all restaurants include not just indoor, air-conditioned units but also outdoor, alfresco-style dining places, the ban of smoking in all restaurants would not be economically and socially unfavourable. Firstly, if smoking is banned in all restaurants, there will be an economic loss as smokers will be deterred from eating at the restaurants. In Singapore, it can be easily observed that a rather large portion of people, of different ages and sex, smoke and this will cause revenue to drop significantly. In addition, if the ban of smoke is due to the creation of a "greener" environment at restaurants, the ban may not prove to be very successful. The issue of smoking and pollution will still persist as smokers who do dine at the restaurants may simply head outside the restaurant to indulge in a stick or two, thus infringing on the benefits of creating smoke-free restaurants. Secondly, the ban of smoking in restaurants may prove to be socially unappealing due to the large portion of smokers in Singapore. With the increasing number of smokers in Singapore and the prominence of cigarette sales in convenience stores, the penetration of smoking as a habit is rising. Although majority of the population in Singapore do not smoke, the smoking sector in Singapore is significant enough to cause many to frown upon the non-smoking law. If the ban of smoking is to encourage people to quit smoking or to make the environment greener, I would suggest stepping up on education campaigns to curb smoking when young, and also public relations campaigns.
