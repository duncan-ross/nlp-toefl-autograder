Everyone knows that smoking is harmful to our health. Even in the pack of the cigarettes, the warning is printed. Although smokers do aware of this fact, many of them do not quit smoking because it is addictive. I also hate smoking, but I disagree to the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Rather, I think it is much better to make smokers smoke only in the smoking area. To begin, this will never stop smokers to smoke. Instead, they will find somewhere else in the restaurant such as bathroom or the entrance of the restaurant because smoking is addictive. It is true that if we ban smoking inside, it would make much better atmosphere for customers who do not like smoking because there are no smokers in their surroundings directly. But, still, customers might feel smokes, if smokers smoke in the bathroom secretly or in the entrance of the restaurant. It affects to other people because the smoke might flow into the restaurant. However, we can solve this problem by making the smoking area. Banning smoking completely would not solve the problem at all, and many owners of the restaurant may also refuse this option, worrying smoking customer would not come. But if we change the proposal as making restricted area for smokers, smoking area, it will satisfy both non-smokers and smokers. By satisfying all kinds of the customers, owners will also like this idea, which is more realistic proposal to everyone. Therefore, banning smoking completely in the restaurant is unrealistic and ineffective way for the convenience of customers. Of course, it would be the best option to quit smoking to every smoker, but because this is quite impossible, it is much better to open some place to smoke which is only for the smokers.
