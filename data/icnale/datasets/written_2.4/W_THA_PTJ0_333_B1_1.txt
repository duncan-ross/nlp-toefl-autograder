I agree with having a part-time job because it is very important for the college students. It is the best way that the students can manage or organize their time. The students can manage their time to do everything step by step. They have to do a time table for their daily life and this is the one method that they can remember which things they should do in each day. Moreover, giving special money inspired the poor college students want to have a part- time job. They will give extra money from a part-time job and this one can confirm that they can work by themselves. They can buy special things such as textbooks and fashionable clothes by using their money. Not only money that they got, they will get more experiences from working with other people. Experience is the best thing that we cannot reach it from class rooms and they can also exchange the new idea with other people who come from different background knowledge. It can make us to be more responsibility people. This is the best experience background to be worked with other people when they graduated. So, the college students should have a part-time job.
