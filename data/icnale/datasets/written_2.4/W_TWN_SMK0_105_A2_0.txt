I hate smoking very much, especially it smells make me feel uncomfortable and hurt my health. I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country, because smoking will hurt everyone's healthy and lung, and if someone smoking in the room, the air will be dirty. Imagine you eat your food but smell something bad, it's awful, isn't it? And restaurant is a public place, not a personal room, I think it should have some rules to restrict some people to do something. Everyone should respect others even if something you want to do but others don't like. My father very likes smoking, so I know the flavor is not good and makes my nose feel very uncomfortable. But he never smoking in the room where others here. I think it's a good idea. Everyone who want to smoking should to go out, far from crowd. But I think the better thing is quit smoking, don't buy cigarettes. It's harmful to person and family, even the society or the country. Especially the cigarettes are more and more expensive, in order to make people quit smoking. Don't smoking in the public place and do a considerate person.
