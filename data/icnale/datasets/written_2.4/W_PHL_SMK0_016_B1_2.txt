Third Hand Smoking Have you ever heard of third hand smoking? I hear it's exactly like smoking cigarettes, only that your cigarette is invisible. This is the new and handy technology in the Philippines. You simply just have to go to your favourite restaurants around town and you get to feel, taste, and actually smoke without having to buy cigarettes. This isn't an advertisement though. And even if you are interested with my Third Hand Smoking Theory, it won't be very amusing if you have asthma and the people seated at the table beside you is like a newly-lit bonfire with all the smoke they're making. Imagine that you're sitting with your old grandma who's allergic to dust and yes, smoke. What if you're with your nephews and nieces and apparently, smoke is also, bad for them. Smoking doesn't sound too good to you now, is it? What if you have colds and the smoke is irritating you, making your nose runny? Now that is the time you 'd take a step back, and rethink your view if smoking should really be allowed in restaurants. I guess you already see my point in this. Obviously, no, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. I really think the Philippines would be better off without it.
