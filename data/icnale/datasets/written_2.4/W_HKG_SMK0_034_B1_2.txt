Have you ever thought about indulging yourselves with a cigarette when you got the job done or when you wanted to take a break from your strained life? However, with the government around the world drawing up anti-smoking regulations, the room for these smokers to take one dwindles exponentially. In fact, when ever more reports and studies reveal the damages cigarettes can do to a human and the surroundings, the establishment of these bills seems imminent. Among all the places, restaurant is one location that may not be taken lightly. On most days, many people will visit a restaurant at least once. Given that second hand smoker has an even higher chance of contracting lethal diseases like lung cancer than smoker, would it be reasonable and responsible to allow smoking in restaurants? The situation I am going to talk about can be mirrored to many others. Whenever I and my family dine at a restaurant in China, we always try to look for tables that will have the least interactions with surrounding people because we simply want to avoid inhaling nicotine and tar along with the wonderful smell from our dishes. By having a little private space, it can make a huge difference to our dining experience. Before you ask me, ask yourself whether you want to be in a hazy environment with nicotine stint or in a visible environment with a pleasant smell.
