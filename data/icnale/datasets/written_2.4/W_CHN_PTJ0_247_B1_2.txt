Nowadays, in China, there are more and more high school graduates entering colleges. This means that there will be more and more college graduates in need of jobs in the future. So I think it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. It is common in china that many college students spend most of their free time playing computer games or staying with their boy or girl friends. I think it is not wise to contribute most of our time to these things. We should make good use of our valuable time in that we may face fierce competition after graduation. So having a part-time job will help us a lot. As a college student, we live in school and contact with our classmates and teachers. We are not familiar with the society where we have to live and work in future. Having a part-time job can help us learn of the society and contact with more people, which can accumulate experience for us so that we can be more competitive in future. Having a part-time job can also let us feel how difficult it is for our parents to earn money, which can make us understand our parents better. To draw a conclusion, having a part-time job is an important lesson for us in college so everyone should try it.
