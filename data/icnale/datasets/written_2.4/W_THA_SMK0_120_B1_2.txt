I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is the bad thing and shouldn't do but people nowadays think smoking is the normal thing most people do that. Smoke from cigarette will destroy human body everyone around you especially yourself. It has a lot of disadvantage that will injure your lung. Causing many diseases for example Lung cancer, Heart disease, High blood pressure, respiratory impairments etc. smoking in public place such as restaurants will make another people look at you as you are bad personality and no one want to stay near because of the smell of cigarettes. If any restaurant has many customers who smoke will affect the atmosphere in the restaurant is not impressive because moreover food or service are the main factor to choose restaurant for family, environment is another reason for the attention of customers to eat. Smoking in public place all got a bad result not only yourself but also everyone around you. If you have conscious mind you should digest where you can smoke or where you can't. But no smoking is the best thing to do for your family, your children and your world.
