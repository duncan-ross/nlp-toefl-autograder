Smoking the customers away In restaurants, not only do you consider the food that will be served; the environment too is key. When you enter a restaurant, you are not only excited to eat, but you also look forward to relaxing while doing so. Unfortunately, the presence of smoking in a restaurant would ruin the mood. Forget about the idea of smoking and non-smoking areas; not all restaurants have these areas. Smoking should be banned from restaurants period. There are areas for the sole purpose of eating. Likewise, smoking-only areas have their place too. We can't overlap their roles; it wouldn't be fair for both sides. They were meant to be separated for a reason; so that both parties could enjoy their said products. You wouldn't want a family entering a restaurant for the purpose of bonding and satisfaction to be bothered by the discomfort of the smoke coming from a cigarette, one that can cause health problems later on. And in the same way, a smoker wouldn't want to have to deal with people complaining about his business; he wants to smoke in peace. Smoking in restaurants is actually a drawback for potential customers. If they pass by a restaurant and see smokers in front, the restaurant wouldn't be as enticing as it should be. Also, restaurants wouldn't be able to accommodate as much customers as they could if there are smoking areas. If non-smokers want to eat in a full restaurant but the only available spot is in the smoking area, wouldn't that be unfair for them? At the end of the day, smoking and restaurants can't be put together. One is meant for nutrition while the other is a detriment to one's health. It is unfair to both smokers and restaurant-goers who simply want to be satisfied.
