It is important for college student to have a part time job. I agree with this statement, because college student can be more independent than before, college student can concern about his studies and concern about anything like do part time job. The college student must have setting their time if they do a part time job. If not, their studies will be break and he just concern to their job. Although they can set their time, they can help their parents paying his studies at the college, the salary can be use to buy something to support his college, buying books, pay boarding house, and many others. It is like my senior story, my senior is in sixth grade, he do part time job as a private teacher, in a month, he can makes money at least Rp. 400. 000, around US $ 50. he use it to buying books and anything that he needs, he not asking to his parents to buy that, he use his own money except paying semester bills, he says to me that not too difficult to do part time job, the most important thing is we can setting our time, and keeps our health to do our studies and part time job. So, who wouldn't do a part time job?
