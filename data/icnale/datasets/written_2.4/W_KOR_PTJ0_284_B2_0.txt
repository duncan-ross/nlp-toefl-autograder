I think that it is not necessary. Of course, it is good to learn about the society and work life before one graduate his or her college and go into the society. Students who have been in only schools can learn practical things about the society. They can meet various people, doing part time job, and it is also very helpful. Those kinds of experiences are very valuable. However, I think that if a student has no need to earn his or her pocket money or money for a living, it will be fine that he or she has no part time job. Without part time job, students can concentrate on their study which is most essential for them. They can meet various people and have various experiences through a variety of programs for college students or twenties. Maybe participating in such programs is more beneficial than doing part time job. For example, let us say a student participate in a group program which for practicing and experiencing marketing supported by an actual big company. The student will meet various people who have different background from his or her as a group and work with them. Also he or she will do meetings and researches and making marketing strategies, and so on with other group members like actual workers do. They can be guided by actual worker of the company. Through this, they can get actual knowledge, experience, and advise which is very valuable and not easy to get. In fact I have part time jobs, but I hope that I can take part in many programs instead of part time job. Because of part time jobs, I cannot participate in those kinds of programs well.
