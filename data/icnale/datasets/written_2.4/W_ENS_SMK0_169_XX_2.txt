I don't agree because I don't believe that it should turn into some sort of crime to smoke in restaurants. After all, it is a private arrangement between the customers and the owners and why should smokers be made to feel like criminals or lepers? Smokers have been banned from many places all over the world already and why? Is it to appease all the non-smokers in this world? If the non-smokers had their way all of the smokers would be whipped and burned at the stake. So why are smokers being forced out of public places when there are far more efficient ways of neutralizing or eliminating smoke fumes? For example, there are several machines available that have been scientifically proved to eliminate nearly one hundred percent of the toxins found in cigarettes. Why are these so easily bypassed when some non-smoking group gets a bee in their bonnets and wants legislation drawn up to ban smoking in restaurants and many other public places. I say that all the smokers of world should band together make a stand against this nonsense that makes our lives more difficult every year. Why don't they stop discriminating against us and make use of modern technology?
