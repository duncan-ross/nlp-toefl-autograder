As most of us know, smoking is an unhealthy hobby as the chemical nicotine in the cigarettes are harmful to our lungs and it will cause harm to not only the smokers, but also the people around the smokers. Smoking in thus a behavior that is highly discouraged. People who are dining in restaurants will want to have a healthy and nice environment in which they are able to dine happily with their loved ones or friends. Nobody would want to dine in a restaurant with the air-con on, and people around them smoking. This will reduce their appetite and cause them to take in the unhealthy second hand smoke, which may pose problems for them later on in life. Imagine that you are on a date with your boyfriend and people around you are all smoking in this air-conditioned restaurant. Your clothes will be stained with the smell of the smoke and people who are unable to stand this smoke will keep coughing throughout the whole dinner. Will you want to stay on and continue to dine in this restaurant? The main difference between restaurants and coffee shops is the surrounding environment and the ambience. This is the reason why people are willing to pay a larger sum of money to dine in the restaurant. If the restaurants are just like the coffee shops with people smoking all over the place, it will be of no difference to coffee shops and people's standard of living will be lowered.
