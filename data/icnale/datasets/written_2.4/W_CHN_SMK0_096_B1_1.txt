 It's said that cigarette was the only good which was sold to reduce the life of people. There are numerous researches to prove the harm of smoking and everyone knows the dangers of smoking. There are also many researches pointed out the dangers of second-hand smoke, even it's more harmful to our health, few of us really aware of it. I hate smoking, I hate being a place filled with smoke, and it makes me feel sick. I notice that in many public places most smokers don't care about others' feelings. They smoke in public places as at their home, especially in restaurant. You can't imagine how bad mood you will have when you entered a restaurant filled with smoke and how disgusting it smells. That's all my real experience. So, one day, I think, maybe smoking should be completely banned by all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is a personal choices, you totally have right to choose smoking or no-smoking, but it doesn't mean the same applies to public places. Actually if you smoke in a public place, you are forcing others smoking with you, you are forcing them to do something which would be very harmful to their health. From a moral standard, smoking in restaurant is prohibited. Second, most of clients come to restaurant with a good mood, they want to enjoy their meal, then image that how will you feel when you eat an excellent food but in a small room filled with smoke. Based on those two reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned by all the restaurants in the country that should not only be done from moral perspective, but also from the law perspective.
