Not allowing smoking in any restaurants is a very good choice. I believe this for several reasons. Not only will banning smoking improve people's health, it will also build a good dining atmosphere. As is known to all, smoking is not healthy. Unfortunately, when smokers smoke in restaurants, they make other people sick at the same time. When the people who smoke have dinner in the same restaurants, people who are not willing to smoke are passive smoking. In that case, the non-smokers have no choice unless they want to give their dinner. They can only get sicker, which is unfair. Of course, banning smoking in restaurants will please non-smokers. It will also improve the smokers' health. They will have fewer opportunities to smoke, so they will smoke fewer cigarettes. Banning smoking in restaurants can also build a good dining atmosphere. Smokers won't trouble the others if they have no right to smoke in restaurants. There will also be fewer awkward. When smokers cut down the number of cigarettes, the good dining atmosphere will be built easily. Finally, it is a good idea to ban smoking in any restaurants because a ban can reduce conflicts. Non-smokers tend to get annoyed and jealous because smokers have an excuse to take frequent breaks. The most significant conflict, however, is over whether smokers have a right to smoke in restaurants. As we have already seen, non-smokers feel they are not always given a choice. If smoking in restaurants is allowed, they will be forced to breathe harmful air. This may violate their rights, and non-smokers are angry with smokers because of it. It seems clear that banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. It will reduce conflict and build a good dining atmosphere. It will also benefit health of smokers and non-smokers alike. I believe that just about anything that improves our health is a good idea!
