Smoking gives pleasure to some people but we all know that cigarette smoking can harm us, so it must be banned in our country especially in all restaurants. Why most important in restaurants? Simply because we can find restaurants in public areas where it can be easily find. Smoking in a place where you are exposed with others is not a good trait. Children might think that what you are doing is not bad. They might try to do it too because they might be curious of what does it feels to take cigarettes. As an adult or a smoker (even if you're young), we should be responsible for all the things that we are doing. We must think first if it can also harm others, not just all the human beings but also our environment. Also, smoking in a public area can harm those who will smell or take in the smoke of the cigarette much affected by the one who is really smoking. When smoking is already banned in all restaurants in Philippines and in other countries, it is a big help to lessen our problems regarding with the air we breathe in.
