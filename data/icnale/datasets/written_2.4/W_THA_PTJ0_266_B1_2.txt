Having experience outside the college is necessary for student nowadays. There are many activities to do after finishing class. For example dancing, reading books, playing sport, attend college club and this one of interesting activities which is doing part time job. Doing part time job is one of the most popular ways for collaged students. You will gain lots of advantages from doing part time job. For instant money, you do not need to ask your parent to buy thing which is expensive or something that they do not support you to buy because you have your own money and you can decide it all. This is not the most important reason of doing part time job. The another one reason which is more important is experience. In my opinion Student should have work experience because if you have work experience like this you will be considered when you are in the application. After you graduate degree is not much necessary for job. If you have more experience you will have more chance. In my opinion collage students should have part time job experience because it will improve your life skill and you will be proud when you can do thing by yourself.
