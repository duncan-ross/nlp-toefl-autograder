By looking at the word "smoking", we are understood that it causes so many problems. Smoking is injuries for health because when a person inhale or exhale smokes from cigarettes, cigars pipes then it effects on lungs. There are thousand of chemicals founds in cigarettes smoke, some of which are harmful to our body. Lung cancer, emphysema and chronic bronchitis are some examples of the effects of the smoking. Many people died at the early ages due to the smoking effects. It is a common experience that when we are sitting in a restaurants and someone started to smoke a cigarettes we become a second-hand smoker. Therefore, I wish many times smoking should be banned in the public places especially in the restaurants. Because smoke is not only unpleasant but it is also unhealthy, so smoker not only damages his own health but also of others. A lot of people argue that smokers have their right that we are living in democratic country. And they said that prohibits the smoking in restaurants is against the personal rights of the smokers. But these people don't know that smokers have no right to become a cause of death for others due to the side effects of smoke of their cigarettes. People come with their families in the restaurants for launch, dinner and for taking meal and for recreation with their family outside from their homes. At the same time, if someone is smoking then its smoke causes to pollute the environment. It caused bad effects on the health of people while they are enjoying their meal. Therefore, smoking should be banned in the restaurants.
