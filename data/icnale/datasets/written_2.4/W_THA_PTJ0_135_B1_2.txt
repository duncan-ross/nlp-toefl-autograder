A part-time job is work for students. We can work if we want. We can find and keep money from this work. We can study and work in the same time. But if you have a part-time job you must don't neglect your study. You necessity manage your schedule is so good for your education and your work. Some work may be toil for you but you should endure because Nothing work it's easy. When you choose this way, you should make good for two ways. Don't neglect your education and you can keep money from your job. This way is good for your life. I agree with college students to have a part-time job. Because I thought we should find experience outside our college. Experience is important for us. It does can help us find our choice in the future. We can choose occupation match for our lifestyle. We might study in same class but we don't have same life. Finally everybody found a work is match for us. But before those days, today we should spend the time to make everything its good for our life in the future. We don't leave time for bad thing. We will build our way from this day. A part-time job will give experience for you. You can't find this experience in your school time, if you don't begin by yourself.
