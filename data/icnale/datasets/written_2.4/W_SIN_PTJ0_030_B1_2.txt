It seems more and more Singaporean students would like to have a part-time job during their college life. Most of the students think it's good because they can earn extra pocket money, and to a lesser extent because the jobs would enrich their college life, and broaden their horizons on how a working class would be like. However, many parents are worrying that by working part time will sometimes affect their children's academic performance, as they often come home late from working place and do not have enough time for lessons and homework. I think a part-time job is advantageous for the students who can adequately arrange the time and those who can make sure the job itself won't distract them from the education. The student should put their school tasks as the priority, and only when the academic performance is satisfied, can they seek for part-time jobs. And, the best time is to take part-time jobs is in school holidays. Secondly, part-time jobs are usually lowly-paid works. I think the students could take a try on it but should never think they can rely on it to earn a lot of money. It is good to gain some working experience before going to the real society, but there's always chance even after graduation, such as gap years or internships. Therefore, part-time jobs are good for students who can handle their leisure time well and knows what is most important at their stage of life.
