To achieve a milestone of having a smoke-free environment and a healthier population, the country has imposed bans on several public places, including restaurants. Smokers are only allowed to smoke at demarcated areas in some restaurants where it would be prohibited elsewhere within the restaurant premises. Most restaurants also ban smoking within their entire premises. This is considerably attributed to take into consideration the non-smokers who would not appreciate, feel unpleasant or even be irritated at the presence of cigarette smoke while they are consuming food and/or beverages in the restaurant. Besides being a health hazard, smoking in the restaurant could also pose a hygiene hazard if the food or beverage is contaminated with cigarette content while being consumed, even if the consumer is not smoking. Restaurants may not be willing to impose a smoking ban (unless the authorities say so) because it may drive some of their customers away from patronising them, since the smokers may be able to find alternatives where smoking is allowed within the premises (or a certain portion thereof). These will discourage restaurants from imposing a smoking ban, and instead encourage restaurants who allow smoking with potentially more customers. To really discourage smokers from smoking, smoking bans should become more stringent to include all restaurants in the country banning smoking. This should actually encourage smokers to quit smoking, instead of being succumbed to temptation by finding another spot where they are actually allowed to smoke. Eventually the country should aim for its people to lead a healthy lifestyle, which should have been the real purpose of banning smoking in so many public places.
