I have never been a smoker and I usually don't go to restaurants where I encounter cigarette smoke, so I have to admit that I honestly have not given much thought to this idea. My parents have told me that smoking used to be pretty common in restaurants, and they also told me that it was pretty terrible. If this is true, then I would have to say that the restaurants in Japan should ban smoking, because I'm sure that there are parents just like mine who feel the same way. Also, I do have a few friends who are smokers, and they don't seem to mind that they cannot smoke in restaurants too much. All they have to do is go outside, and often it is nice to get a nice breath of fresh air while you are out there, they say. I really do hope that they will not smoke forever, and I think that banning smoking in restaurants has made at least a little bit of progress in encouraging people to quit smoking. If more countries ban smoking in restaurants, more people will be able to quit smoking, and everyone will become more healthy. I guess that this is a pretty good goal for the next few years.
