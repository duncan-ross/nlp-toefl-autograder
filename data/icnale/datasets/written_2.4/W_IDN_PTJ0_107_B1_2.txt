Statistic taken from surveying says that 60% of college students in Indonesia do a par-time job. The data tells an expensiveness of the price becomes the most reason why they do the job besides others reasons such as looking for some experiences and self-satisfying. Another survey tells doing the part-time job is the most effect of why many college students stop their studying in university. Those data make a think that the job activity is really useless because the responsibility of student is only learning. The job activity can influence the student to be consent only for the job and they spend many times only for working. Based on the situation, logically they will not have a lot of time to take a rest after studying or to do their assignments and finally they won't do the homework more over they will be tired when doing lecture in university because most of them go home from working in the night. But it is not a certainly right because if the students can be smart in managing their time by separating when they have to study, to do homework, and to do job. It will not take some effect. Because I have many friends that are success do the two activities. So I agree with the statements of it is important for college students to have a part-time job on condition they have to clever in managing time.
