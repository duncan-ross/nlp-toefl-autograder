In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide without the government's help, if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers, but the ultimate issue is choice. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries. Our government aims to protect us, to save us from society's evils. However, in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 1994, the statistical evidence does not support a conclusion that there are substantive health effects the feds have failed to protect a vital part of the Indonesia economic population: business owners. Many people who drink also tend to smoke; banning drinkers from smoking has hurt business in some bars and restaurants. The decrease in customers and subsequent loss of revenue has far-reaching effects on employers. A study by LIPI in Earth Day's seminar Effect of Bans on smoking in restaurants can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments.
