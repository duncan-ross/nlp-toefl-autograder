When I graduated from the senior high school called Ching-mei girls' high school, I got the first part time job from the classmate in the university. The part time job was that I had to check the student list and sometimes I must record the class in order to some absent students could watch this video tape to catch up with other students in the cram school. Although that part time job is extremely boring and low salary, I still had made many friends and been sure to be a kind and patient teacher in the future. Therefore, I have started to be a tutor to teach junior high school students Chinese Literature for six years. I have taught fifty students these days, and the oldest students are just being graduates in NTNU this year! I am really proud of them. I always believe that teaching is not only students are learning but also teachers are, too. Because of teaching, I even acknowledge that how deep the parents' love is! However, I often felt much depressed that students had no ambition about learning and just wanted to idle around all day. In spite of encouraging them, what should I do?
