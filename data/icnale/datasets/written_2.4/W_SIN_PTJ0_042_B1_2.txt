It is not important for college students to have a part-time job. However, it is recommended for them to do so that they can gain the experiences that come with having a job. It also helps the college students to prepare themselves for the working world, to show them that that the working world is not a rosy place. They can also learn how to interact with people of different levels, their supervisors, colleagues and customers, etc. Sometimes, the college kids can be exposed to instances where they find themselves being interested in their jobs and therefore make the choice to continue serving in that line after graduating from college or universities. Also, not to forget the friendships forged among colleagues that might last a lifetime and also serve as a helpline in the future when they need to find any job opportunities by word of mouth. However, the college students must make sure that they are able to concentrate on their studies as well as the same time and not focus all their energy and time at work. The college students should also be guided by their parents in such a way that they do not misuse their salary earned by using it on distasteful matters such as smoking or getting themselves wasted.
