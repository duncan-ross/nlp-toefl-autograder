I think students should have a part time job. I agree that studying hard is more important for students. For studying, however, we need lots of money. For that, we need a part time job. There are three reasons why I should have a part time job. First, school expenses are never cheap and a room rent is so expensive. My parents are charged with all of them. For parents, I should have part time job, so I earn my pocket money. That is the first reason I should have a part time job. Second, I have to spend money for buying books, clothes and others. Every day, I have to meal. Sometimes, I hang out with my friends. When I do these things, I need a lot of money. That is the second reason I should have a part time job. Third, I should have better English skills for taking a better job, so I have to go to an academy. Sometimes, I want to do something like a hobby. These days, prices are so expensive. If I want to do something, need lots of money. That is the third reason I should have a part time job. In conclusion, I should have a part time job because of these reasons.
