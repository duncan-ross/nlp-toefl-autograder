Many people ask me what is smoking well for. I answer them that smoking doesn't have a good thing but many people like to smoking. It has many ways to smoke such as cigarette and pipe. In a cigarette it has nicotine that can make you to get a lung cancer. If you don't smoking but you stay in a place that has a smoker you will get a disease too. Many people die because of lung cancer per year. When you are smoking nobody don't want to be around you because it bad for lung. Nowadays number of smoker is decreasing that is a good new. In my home town has a rule that Don't smoking in public place just like in a restaurant. But somebody doesn't follow the rule. They will fine by the police if they found them. It's doesn't hard to throw away the smoking. First when you are wanted to smoke, you should do anything instead. Next you should play sport or do exercise and don't be serious when you do something fail. Last if you can't do that you should see the doctor, doctor will give you a good advice and the way how to avoid it.
