I think that is very important for some college student, because some student in the college do not have a lot of money to use to eat, buy something, shop etc. I think the college must to do something with the student each find the part-time job, given a job in the college to the student and pay money too, or given a chance to do part-time job at the restaurant, coffee shop, super market, museum, library, gasoline station etc. if the students in college have a part time job, I think they so have happy life, have a chance to do anything like any students in the college, but although the money is not anything or everything in this world, or can not buy everything but I think the money is important to one people who's not have a lot of money to living in a day to be different for the student who's have a lot of money to living, eat, buy something or order, travel etc. for that reason a part time job is very important to the college students. That's make a happy feel and a good chance to they forever.
