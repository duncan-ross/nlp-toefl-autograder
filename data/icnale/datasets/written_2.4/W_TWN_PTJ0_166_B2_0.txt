Having a part-time job is important and necessary for college students. First, college students can earn different experience during working like communication skills and problem-solving skill, which may help them in daily live. Besides, they can learn how to arrange their time by dividing time into pieces for school works which were needed to be done or to be studied, for school activities which they enjoy doing and are interested in, and for part-time jobs that they choose to have. However, it is very important to evaluate yourselves whether you can handle all things well or not. Everyone has limited time and there are a lot of things waiting to be done. It is always the top priority for students to take care of school subjects and study hard. As a result, if you fail to make good performances on your study, it is a wrong decision for you to have a part-time job. Though there are many advantages for college students to have a part-time job, they should think twice before having a part time job. Do not fail school subjects just because you spend a great deal of time on part-time jobs and have no time to study.
