I agree because the restaurants are called as a public place, so all public places should ban people not to smoke. Smoking in public places constitute harm those people who are around them very much. Even if it is in the restaurant if smokers will provide a meal on the need to smoke inhaled toxic fumes and that's important smoking in public places whether it is anywhere considered as not respecting the rights of others if they want to smoking it should be a special place for smoking specifically. However smoking is directly attacked themselves so if they can quit smoking, it should be done early so that their health are still have time to retain themselves. To your good health and to the health of the people around you, smokers should concern about that. But if it works well for most of restaurants to ban on smoking in their businesses, we all should work together, cooperate with each other to help each other follow the campaign to ban the smoking is what is right. If the person found smoking in restaurants, we should dare to go tell that person that do not smoke in this state. For the benefit of themselves and those around me, and to society more livable.
