The issue of whether smoking should be allowed in public places or not has been under the microscope for the best part of six years; This report revealed that people who had never smoked but who live with a smoker were 30 per cent more likely to develop lung cancer and 24 per cent more likely to have a heart attack or die from coronary heart disease than those living with a non-smoker. Banning smoking in public places may seem like a drastic decision, however, personally I believe that it is in the interests of public health that smoking be banned in public places. People argue that because smoking tobacco is legal that it should be allowed to be consumed wherever they want, There are fears that the banning of smoking in public places, especially in nightclubs, bars and restaurants could lead to loss business; resulting in loss of profits employment. The response from people favouring bans was that, "as a matter of priority, the safeguarding of public health is more important than profit. " The main argument on the side against banning smoking in public places is that it would be discriminating against individual smokers. And because they're addicted to nicotine, which is present in cigarettes, the ban would be punishing smokers for something they claim to have no control over. In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide—without the government's help—if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers,. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries.
