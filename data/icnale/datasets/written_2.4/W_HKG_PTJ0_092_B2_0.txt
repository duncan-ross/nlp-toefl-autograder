It is now common that university students have a part-time job, even the classmate sitting next to you may also has a part-time job. The reasons that they get a part-time job may be support of family, support of their own life style, savings for future, return the borrowed money, etc. From my point of view, it is not important for university students to have a part-time job. First of all, the part-time jobs having by the university students are usually not related to their studies. They usually choose the jobs that are usually easy and can earn money fast. For the example of my friend, he is also a university students, he asked me if I had any part-time job and he told me that he had already got a part-time job of be a tutor to teach a secondary school student. It only helps students to earn more money to support their school fee and expense of daily life. Someone may argue that having a part-time job can make students to gain more experience and prepare for future. I don't deny this claim but for most of the time, these working experience are not available for us to prepare our future. As we can see, the kinds of part-time jobs are usually the tutors, restaurant waiters, these works are usually not being chosen by students to be their future job after graduation. They will choose the jobs related to their studies or the job they interested in. Therefore, I do not agree with the statement that it is important for university students to have a part-time job.
