As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants as fast as possible. Masses of reasons can be listed. First, smoking is so harmful behavior that it not only harms smokers themselves but also a lot of innocent people like us. As we all know, the smoke contains countless poisonous gas, which can easily result in cancer. Second, restaurants are public places. We are supposed to attach attention to our own behaviors for the simple reason that what we do has an impact on others, especially like smoking and other disagreeable manner. The smoke makes us hard to breathe. Besides, people who go to restaurants tend to enjoy the nice food and comfortable atmosphere. However smoke definitely ruins all the things we longing for. I am convinced that while enjoying their meals no one wants to be crowded with choking clouds of smoke. Apart from the reasons listed, there is one thing we cannot ignore—safety. It is a common sense that a thrown cigarette butt is an object with high temperature, which can contribute to a fire. To sum up, it is never too late to forbid smoking at all the restaurants with the intention of public's health and safety.
