Part time job is a kind of work that can help us to use free time usefully. The students who are studying in university, they usually work the part time job in order to make money for education. They work regardless of safety, health, and the effect about studying in class. The almost student will go to work after class everyday and they will come back to dormitory after midnight or greater than this that means they don't rest of themselves because they have to study in next day with the body that very tired. It causes them to have a disease from sleeping not enough. Moreover, in workplace maybe has a person who is smoking that means they have to smell it, too. On the others hand, when the students don't sleep enough they maybe feel sleepy in class. It makes them lose times to learn new things that cause them to get low grade in exam. When to talk about safety, the students have to drive the cars for coming back to dormitory. They maybe have an accident during on the way. Perhaps, in workplace has the thief or naughty person that maybe hit them. However, part time job make the students to have the money for education. I think they should to be careful and regardless about safety, healthy, and studying.
