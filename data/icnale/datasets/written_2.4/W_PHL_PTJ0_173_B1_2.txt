Is it important for students to have a part time job? I assume that it depends on the student's capability of balancing his time. He could either study diligently, or study at the same time has a part time job. By studying diligently, he could obtain a scholarship which will greatly aid his parents. The student must maintain his high grades in order to not forfeit the scholarship. Having a part time job is very tedious, because he has to attend school, and then have his work done. By the time the student reaches home, he is too laborious to even do his assigned home works. I believe that it also depends on the student's financial status. If the student's parents can't sustain the child's education, the student must acquire a way to aid his parents in his or her studies. This decision lies in the hands of the student, whether he or she wants to succeed in life. All we have to do is to have the drive we need in life, once we get that drive, we will be tested. We must never give up. Life is unpredictable. I think that having a part time job has its pros and cons. One of the pros is that, the student could finish his education, at the same time help in the family. One of the cons is that, the student's body will not be healthy anymore, since he has to stress himself out both in school and in the workplace. The sky isn't always blue, the sun doesn't always shine. So it's okay to fall apart sometimes but always remember to get back up again.
