 Not only men but also women smoke around the world. However, there is one thing that deserves us discussing, if smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. in my opinion it is a good chose to ban smoking in all restaurants. To start with, restaurants are the places for people to eat food. If you smoke, it will not only pollute the environment but also does harm to other people's health. Because we all know there are many diseases linked with smoking. for example people who smoke are easier to have cancer than others who do not smoke, so smoking in public is not polite even unequal to other person. what's worse, smoking is unsafe. Building a restaurant needs a lot of money, just a cigarette may cause a fire which will destroy the whole restaurant. In a word, as far as I am concerned, it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants in the country. We can image if there were no smoking in all the restaurants what our environment will become and may be people can live longer than when smoking is not limited in public. Considering all the aspects, banning smoking does brings no harm to anything around us but good.
