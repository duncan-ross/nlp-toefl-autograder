In my opinion part-time job is important for college students. Part-time job is something that helps college students practice themselves before getting job in the future. They receive many experiences from working in part-time job and it makes college students use their time for the useful things. All these, depends on the job that they choose to do, it must be a good part-time job for themselves, not against religion and the job must be please their parents. Moreover, college students can get some money from their part-time job, it also reduce their parents' burdens, too. They must sure that they use their money carefully, use it with the good things not spend it extravagantly and don't forget to save it for their future. It is no good working too long time with the part-time job, it will harm yourself and affect to your study. So, you have to choose the part-time job that the time is appropriate for college students. Some students spend their free time to do a part-time job, I think it is a good idea because they did not use their time to do something that useless such as playing games, reading comic books etc. and they know how to manage their time. Every student should try to do a part-time job.
