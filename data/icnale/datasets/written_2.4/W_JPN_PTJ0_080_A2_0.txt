I disagree with this statement. Because I think that college students are coming to the college to study advanced things that they don't know yet or that they need in the future, so they have to concentrate on studying that they to do. I worry that the part-time jobs prevent them from studying at college. I think if they start to do part-time jobs, they need more and more time than when they are high school students. Then they probably eliminate the time to study or sleep to do part-time jobs. I also think to do part-time jobs is good for them from the view of being the members of the society. But as you know less sleeping tires them and makes them sleepy always, but if you are tough guy or girl, it means nothing. If you are sleepy during the lessons at the college, it means nothing to do study at college. I think if they want to study difficult and advanced things that they don't know yet, they need mach time and power to study hard and the time to sleep that keeps them well. In this way, I think to do part-time jobs is not so good for college students.
