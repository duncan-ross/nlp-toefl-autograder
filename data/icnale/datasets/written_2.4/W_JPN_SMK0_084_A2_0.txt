I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Since smoking causes not only us but also around people bad condition. In this society, it is easy for us to feel that Smoking people is separated from not smoking people. The smell of tobacco is not good. I am caught a serious illness by harmful substances containing it. From one experiment, we find that people who breathe in the smell of tobacco by smoking people live shorter than other people. So, smoking influence many people who is not only smoking people but also not smoking people. In fact, smoking is banned in the station, in the train, in the office, in the hospital, and so on. All of these places are common places. People who want to smoke have to move smoking room. Restaurant is one of the common places. Many children and adult people come to restaurant to eat lunch. Can you smoke in front of these people? What you smoke in the restaurant may cause them some illness. I think we should spread this statement all over the world. To protect people who enjoy eating lunch in the restaurant from the smell of tobacco in smoking.
