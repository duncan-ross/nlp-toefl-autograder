Smoking in public areas and restaurants should be banned in Japan. I have lived here on and off for a few years and one thing that really irks me is inhaling other people's filthy cigarette smoke against my will. I think that it is about time that smoking in public places and restaurants in Japan was prohibited once and for all. I refuse to sit in a restaurant with smokers and eat a meal because the last thing I want to do is chew my food combined with the flavour of someone's leftover smoke fumes. It is bad enough when I am walking down the street behind someone smoking a cigarette. Unless the wind is blowing the opposite way, the smoke always blows back in my face and I try to hold my breath as I quickly walk past them. I realize that they have the right to smoke but what about my rights not to smoke or breathe it in when I am walking down a public street. My exhaling is not going to hurt them but when they smoke and exhale, it could very well kill me or cause me to get ill if it happens enough times.
