Smoking has become a lifestyle for most men even some women today. Not only adults, but teenagers also smoke in their early age. There are three main factor that cause young people smoke which are environment, prestige, and sensation. Firstly, they smoke because they are doing what everybody is doing. By seeing their parent and friends smoking, teenagers think that smoking is a common lifestyle. They don't realize that inhaling smoke causes damage to their respiratory system and may cause various respiratory diseases, such as TBC, and bronchitis. Secondly, they smoke because of prestige. One's friend won't approve a boy as a gentleman if he does not smoke. Smoking has been a requirement so that one can be called mature and becomes a man. Last of all, they smoke because smoking brings certain sensation such as relaxation, and enjoyment. They smoke several times and they found it was fun. Later on, they get addicted to it and cannot live without smoking. I conclude that smoking has been a lifestyle to young people because it is done by many people, it brings prestige to the smokers, and it brings certain sensations. Having said that, in my opinion smoking should be banned at all public places including restaurants.
