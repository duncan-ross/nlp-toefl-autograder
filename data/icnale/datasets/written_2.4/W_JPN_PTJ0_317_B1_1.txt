I think part time job is not important for college student. Because they can study only while they are student, so they should spent their time for their study. When they are student, they feel lecture is boring and not interesting. But they understand they waste their precious time after they graduate college and have to take a job. My parents often say that you have to study hard while you can study. And they say we don't save their money for your study, so you don't have to do part time job. I can't still understand importance of lecture. In the future lecture may help me. When I was little, I take many lessons. Piano, basketball, swimming, writing, English and so on. I don't like those at that time. But now I think they are useful. For example, thanks to basketball and swimming, I can get strength. Thanks to piano, I can read music. As long as those, lecture may help me in future. They do part time job for many reasons. Some of them have to part time job for their life. I am happy because I don't have to do part time job for my life. So I can't say college student should not do part time job. But college student should keep their mind that they spent their precious time on part time job.
