Smoking is really bad to our health especially for the young ones who are very exposed to it. Their bodies are not into that kind of chemical; they might get a disease or a cancer out of it in the future. And for me I don't like smokers, especially the smell of the smoke thing. The researchers even the doctors said that the second hand smokers are more prone to the cancerous illnesses because we're not just inhaling the smoke but the breath of the smokers. Good thing that the government officials are having the or way or planning to have a vat on cigarette companies, I hope that their move will lessen the people who will buy the cigarettes. And I would suggest that they should ban the smoking in private places even in public. Or they should implement a law to the minor smokers that they will pay if the cups caught them smoking. Every hit that you blow, half of your life is decreasing. Business is business, people who invented this kind of thing might not think the negative out of it, and they are just after the money. I wish that someday, smokers will realize or find out that kind of chemical; they might get a disease or a cancer out of it in the future. And for me I don't like smokers, especially the smell of the smoke thing.
