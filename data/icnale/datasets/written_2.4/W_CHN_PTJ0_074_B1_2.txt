College life is full of colorful activities. There are many alternative choices for college student to arrange their schedule. Though studying is still one of our necessary assignments, most college students hold the point of view that it is also important for them to take a part-time job. As a saying goes Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. College is thought to be a bridge combines the school with society. We are facing to work after our graduation. First of all, we may learn much more knowledge and accumulate social experience from the part-time job out of the book. Besides, taking part-time job can improve our social skills. Once we walk into society, we have to build relationship with different people. So during the part-time job, we may have suffered a lot of social problem. What's more, we can make more friends during the work. Many friends of mine have taken part-time jobs, such as waiter, postman, tutor, etc. They are all excited about their work. My roommate Amy told me in a high spirit when I interview her about part-time job. She said, I've ever been an English tutor for a half year when I was a freshman. I took a bus to the family once a week. The day before the work, I spend a whole night to make full preparations. My student Jim was a cute boy and his parents were friendly to me. Not only can I review my English, but also I get my own paid every week. It was a satisfying job. If time permits, I suggest college students taking some part-time job. And you will benefit much from it!
