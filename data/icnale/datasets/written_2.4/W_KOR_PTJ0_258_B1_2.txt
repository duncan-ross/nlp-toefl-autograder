When people go to college, most of them start to spend a lot of money compared to their high school days in books, house rent and even drinks. It is clear that they need some money, but I do not think it is a good idea to ask parents for money. College students should become somewhat independent from their parents with money matters, because they are not children anymore. Parents might support their children's college tuition a little, but they cannot pay everything for their children. Moreover, having a part-time job will make college students know the value of money, and make them not waste money because they know how hard it is to make money. There is another reason why it is important to have a part-time job. Having part-time jobs will give college students job experiences before they have a full-time job. It would be really helpful if they find their interests or even hidden talents through part-time jobs before they have a full-time job. Some people regret having their full-time job after they realize that the job was not exactly as same as what they expected. Part-time job is less risky than full-time job. For their future job careers, I highly recommend college students have a part-time job.
