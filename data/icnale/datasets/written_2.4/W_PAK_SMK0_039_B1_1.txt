The word smoking itself contains many jeopardizes. Beside this many smokes, don't realizing about their precious gift of GOD Health. It starts by fun or may be get impressed by some one's style of smoking. And at last they become addict of this bad habit. Some heart breakers used to say that I trust a ciggarrate more than a girl, because cigarratte will damage my lungs not break my heart. What a funny sentence they used to comment. Even they don't realize that if heart breaks by some one's rude attitude it doesn't matter because you will not have to pay a grand lost of physical fitness. But when lungs are get damaged, it will creat a menace and your health will be affected, even the precious and scrumptious gift LIFE may also be lost. Then we have to decide by ourself that should we prefare lungs to be broken or the Heart? The physicians reports that a chain smoker kill himself five years before his death time. The main interesting thing I came to see that on the packets of ciggarrate the tobacco company has written that Tobacco kills it's best customers, what a dilemma this is ?On the one side they do the marketing of it and on the other hand they warns the public. In such circumstances we judge by ourselves whom to be preferred i. e The LIFE or DEATH.
