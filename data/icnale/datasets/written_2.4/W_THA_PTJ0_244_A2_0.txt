Part-time job should have or not for college students. Personally, students who have part-time job can use the time to useful and is support your family to save money. On the other hand, work part-time job can make to bad study so you must share your time. But part-time job have many merit as well. Part-time job make you can see many the new experience. You can meet many people but you cannot to meet them in the classroom and you can support your family to save money or save your money for buy something. But part-time job is not popular for Thai students because college and university in Thailand is study very hard. Sometime in college have many actives make not free time for students to find part-time job. When the times go to summer part-time job is first choice for many students to select for use free time in they summer. Part-time job have many choice give you select as supermarkets, restaurants and part-time job on internet you should select to good yourself. You should think part-time job important for college fife or not. It is good to do part-time job when you have free time and have work experience. So, I agree college students should do.
