 I am now a freshman in the college. My family is not rich, so my parents have to work hard to pay for two children's education, my brother and me. So before I entered the university, I found a part time job to relieve their pressure. My part time job was to help students in high school learning. As it was the first time I teaching others formally, I was a bit nervous at the beginning. And the preparation was not very rich. After several times, I came to get used to the job and have better and better performance. When I got my first pay, though it's low, I feel really encouraged. A part time job doesn't need to be very grate and formal. No matter how slight or dull it is, just do it. And you will find something worth. There are the topmast masters in every profession. As far as I am concerned, I like trying new things, no matter how difficult it is. Finding difficulties and overcoming them is my enjoyment. I think a part time job is a good experience which can not only resolve the financial problem, but also can enrich my life. From tension in the beginning till liking the job, what I really achieved is a valuable social experience which is significant in the future. So just wasting time to play or sleep is not better than finding a part time job.
