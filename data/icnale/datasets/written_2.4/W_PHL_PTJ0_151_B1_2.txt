There's a lot of advantage and disadvantage of having a part time job as a student or while studying, students who work are more confident and possess better time-management skills than students who are not employed. In addition to offering a paycheck some independence and satisfaction, a part-time job can provide both training and experience. Most of them can provide their own needs such as payment for their tuition fees, transportation and other expenses that they need in their study. On the other hand it has a bad effect like, it can lead to dropping out entirely. Working long hours can also limit opportunities to build friendships and explore interests that enhance intellectual and emotional development. As a student we need to know how to manage our time. It's not bad if we are going to have a part time job if our goal is to help our family, provide our needs in the school, to buy the things we want, and to have a experience. We just need to put in our mind the word Study First because this word can help us to motivate ourself to pursue and attain our goals in life, we need to finish our study to have a better life and better future. And also we need to trust God in all the things we do, because God said do your part and I will do my part.
