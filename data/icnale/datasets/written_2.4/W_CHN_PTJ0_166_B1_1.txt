In recent years, many college graduates have difficulty in finding a job and face a fierece competition. The situtation has aroused a common concern about if is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Personally speaking, I adovocate college students should have a part-time job. On one hand, we know, college students have a part-time job can earn their pockets money, and in this way, it can reduce the burden of their family. Besides, they may make friends with many people from who college students can benefit a lots. On the other hand, as job markets are decreasing, unemployment among the graduates is increasing. College students have more skills and experience can make them more appealing to the employers and companies. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich your skills and experience when you at college. Taking advantage of your college free time, improving and enhancing yourself, when you graduate from college you will excel other college students and don't worry about you will face a fierce competition and cannot find a good job. In my perspective, a college student to have a part-time job has many adavantages and disadvantages. It is not only can earn money that can solve your financial crisis, but also you can learn a lot of experience and knowledge that can perfect you. So in order to have more chance than others, college students should take part-time job and make use of our free time to enhance oursleves.
