When we go to restaurants we expect that we will have a good time. We expect that we could enjoy every meal that would be served to us. But all these things are ruined by some people who are so inconsiderate about what others feel. I am talking about the people who smoke inside restaurants. Smoking in general is not good and unhealthy. It affects you and the people around you. These facts are well known by all. In fact the smoker even knows that smoking is bad and still they keep on smoking. But my problem is do they really need to smoke everywhere they want even in restaurants? I have one good example of a smoker who does not pick a place when he smokes. It is my dad. My dad is known as a chain smoker he can finish two packs of cigarette in one day. He smokes anywhere he wants and at any time wants, but when we go out and eat in restaurant he controls himself not to smoke inside. He thinks about the people who will be affected around him, his family and even the people that he doesn't even know. If one person can control their urge not to smoke. Why can't others do the same?
