Is part-time job good or bad for college students? I think that is decided by the way how students think about part-time job. If someone thinks part-time job can bring a lot of experiences, he (or her) may be hard in working to get experiences that are important for him. However, if someone who just wants to earn the money and thinks the part-time job just the tool to make money, he will never take a serious thought for the job. Therefore, he spends a lot of time that can be used in studying to do the job, but he didn't get the most important present of the part-time job. From this sight, it isn't important for college students to have a part-time job, because studying is the first work for students. But from other sight, if students can get good experiences from the part-time job, it may be important for college students to have a part-time job. From I entered the university I have the part-time job twice a week. I teach junior high school students and learn from them by trying to understand what the students think about and what they need. I think part-time job is very important for me to learn the experiences.
