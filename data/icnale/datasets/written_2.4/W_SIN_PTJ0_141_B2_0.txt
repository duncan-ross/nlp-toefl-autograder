Regarding the argument on whether it is essential for college students to have part-time jobs, my stand is it would depend on the student's circumstances. A specific set of circumstances the college student faced as described in this paragraph will demonstrate that it is essential for the college student to find a part-time job. For example, if the student is facing financial difficulties or is coping well with his or her studies and has ample time, not knowing what to do with it, then a part-time job will be essentially beneficial to the student. A benefit is the financially poor student will have an alternative source of income to offset the tuition costs during his study, so that the financial burden is not as heavy after graduation; this translates into less financial stress for the student when the student is on a full-time employment. Another benefit is certain part-time jobs, like desk receptionists and clerks, enable students to gain useful communication and working skills, which are essential in the working world and can not be taught in classes. Students with extra time should consider taking up such part-time jobs to gain useful soft skills. With that said, another set of circumstances as described in this paragraph will argue that part-time jobs are not essential for college students. For example, if the student is close to failing in his or her studies, it is better for the student to use the extra time to focus on passing his or her studies instead of seeking a part-time job. Also, if the student is able to find better opportunities, like research or start-up projects, that are more beneficial to his or her holistic development compared to part-time jobs, then it will be wise to forgo part-time jobs.
