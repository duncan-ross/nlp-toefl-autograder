Maybe it looks cool to have a cigarette. However, the fume from the cigarette is more harmful for others around you. I do agree to ban smoking at a public place, such as restaurant. Today, there are too many people in China smoking and too many people leading a bad life. When they have a cigarette, their lungs will become black. And when they have one more, it will be blacker. As a result, it will maybe cause them a pneumonia, or a more serious disease. However, maybe you do not know that people nearby a smoker will be affected more seriously. Fume form a lit cigarette has much more poisonous substance than that is insoaked in. So it should be banned smoking in a public place, where there are many people. Banning smoking can weaken pollution and make a stable and peaceful living environment. When we have a dinner in a smoking banned restaurant, we will feel good though then we will have no bad feeling, which is our want to have and appreciate. I do agree to ban smoking in a public place.
