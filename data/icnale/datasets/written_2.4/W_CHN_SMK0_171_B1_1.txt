 Nowadays, more and more people smoke. When you walk on the street you can see people smoking, when you are shopping in the shops you also can see people smoking, you can see the scenery in many places, but whether we should ban smoking in the restaurant. Different people have different views about this question. In my opinion we should ban smoking in the restaurant because it is where people eat food and have a rest there. If someone smoke there it can affect other people, people' emotion can be bad then so they may not come to the restaurant to have meals any more. And we all know smoking is very bad for our health. It can cause smokers to have some disease. Non-smokers sit around them when they smoke can also have some diseases. So smoking should be banned in the restaurant to keep everyone safe and healthy. Smoking in public is also a bad thing, it can affect your personal image. Children in the restaurant may learn from your example. But sometimes there are many people in the restaurant so people have to wait for a long time to have meals so they feel very boring to smoke, it needs restaurants to take actions to improve the efficient. In a word, I agree with the opinion that we should ban smoking in the restaurant.
