Smoking is considered to be a haven to smokers. They regard smoking as a solution to their problems and stress. As a result, these smokers smoke at frequent intervals in different places, including places of public interests such as parks, the streets or even inside restaurants. Yes, smoking may now be judged as a normal action in public dwellings, but inside restaurants, smoking activities should be prohibited. There are several reasons why smoking should be banned in public eating areas. Firstly, non-smoking people inside the restaurants become second-hand smokers in the presence of smoking activities. Remember that second-hand smokers have a higher risk of acquiring diseases brought about by smoking than the smokers. Secondly, the people eating in these establishments might lose their appetite on their food because of the foul smell emitted by the lighted cigarettes. Lastly, smoking activities disturbs the atmosphere of the restaurants. Normally, restaurants should emit an enticing and indulging aura, but if there are smokers inside, the restaurant environment would become foul-smelled and there would surely be dark clouds of smoke emitted through the cigarettes of the smokers. This could account for lesser people dining in these restaurant establishments. Smoking may be a sweet escape to cigarette smokers, but to others who are not, it is a vice that needs to be addressed immediately in order to promote the health and well-being of the citizens. That is why smoking activities should be banned inside all restaurant establishments in the country.
