With the development of human being, the level of our living standard is improving very fast. College students have more allowance, but whether they need to take a part-time job is a heated discussion. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is meaningful to students now. First of all, taking a part time job can release the burden on the shoulder of parents. Since most of our college students are completely be adults, we should take our responsibility to ourselves and try to make live for ourselves. We need our part-time jobs. Furthermore, taking part-time job can help us know the society in advance. We all should live in the society and no one can live alone in twenty-first century. We ought to learn how the society works and what we need to adapt ourselves to the society. Fortunately, if we make mistake when we are doing our part-time job, it may cost less. Thus, part-time job gives us a chance to make mistake and can teach us a lesson without much pay. Last but not least, part-time job can let us know the difficulties of making living. Since we were born to the world, we depend on our parents and ask for living. We never know how hard our parents work and how heavy the living burden on the shoulder of our parents. Part-time jobs can let us know these. In one word, part- time is a good choice for students in college. In my opinion, this is a chance.
