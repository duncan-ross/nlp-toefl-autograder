Part time jobs have been popular among college students. Some hope to be more financially independent of his or her family, while others deem it exciting and fresh to have a part time job experience. I think before one starts his or her part time job, he or she should be fully prepared, both physically and mentally. For those who have already fill their daily schedule with classes and extracurricular activities, the only portion of time that is left available for a part time job can be that is required for rest. In this way, a part time job is undoubtedly posing threat to one's energy and health. It has been the case that many dedicate themselves to their part time jobs while their curricula at school, which should have been their higher priority, are laid less emphasis or even abandoned. Absurdly, one might earn money that is less in figure than the cost of skipping classes, which are paid for to attend. What's more, time spent on one's part time job can be either spared from time that is meant for studying or entertainment, while the former is often preferred so that one's performance at school is affected dramatically. As a way to earn extra money and for social learning, a part time job shouldn't be a burden that does harm to your studies and health. One should take all those things into account before he or she begins a part time job career, or the cost will turn out to be so huge that one can't restore.
