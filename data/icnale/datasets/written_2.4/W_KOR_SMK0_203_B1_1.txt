I disagree smoking in public place. Smoking is detrimental to other people. Cigarette contains tar, nicotine, etc toxic substance. For the reason, the other people hate smoking smell, and smoke. Thus smoker must smoke in the outside that not in building. But nowadays, despite decreasing smokers, sometimes a few smokers have smoked in public place. The smokers have damaged to non-smokers. Non-smokers have suffered from smokers. Let's change our thinking. First we change our awareness. Smokers have to think that non-smokers have suffered from their smoking smell. Also non-smokers have to think that smoking is not bad thing, but to harm the other people is bad thing. Second, the government must make smoking room in public area and building. Maybe smokers think that there are a few legal smoking areas. Therefore the government has to make legal smoking area throughout public area, buildings. Third, raise cigarette tax. Raising cigarette tax is increasing government's budget as well as decreasing smokers. And the tax must use for smoker. For instance, to make the smoking room, to develop no-smoking smell, no smoking-smoke cigarette. With this I finish my thinking that smokers and non-smokers damaged smokers. If smoker and non-smoker help each other, the world is more attractive. Think the opponent's situation.
