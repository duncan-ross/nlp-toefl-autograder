Smokers can be sighted almost everywhere --- at bus stops, hawker centres, or even outside shopping malls. With the increase in the number of smokers and the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, the Singapore government has thus stepped up regulatory controls on smokers. The question then arises as to whether smokers should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. To me, I believe that the welfare of society should outweigh the welfare of the individual; hence I strongly agree that there should be a complete ban on smoking at all restaurants in Singapore. Given the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, where passive smokers may end up breathing in the carcinogenic chemicals from the exhaled cigarette smoke and develop lung-related diseases, more regulatory control should be in place to protect non-smokers. As restaurants in Singapore are commonly air-conditioned, smoking in restaurants would mean that the cigarette fumes would still remain within the compound and be hard to get rid of. This not only increases the risk of second-hand smoking, but also exposes more individuals to it. Since the fumes stay around for longer periods of time and are unable to escape from the enclosed air-conditioned compounds of the restaurants, diners at the restaurants would hence be breathing in these fumes and be more exposed to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking. Also smoking will affect the mood and dining experience of people at the restaurants as the stench from the cigarette fumes is not bearable to most people. Restaurant owners will also be affected if diners are being turned away by the strong cigarette smell and choose to dine elsewhere. In this case, the welfare of society is being adversely affected by the smoker's actions. Hence I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. (298 words)
