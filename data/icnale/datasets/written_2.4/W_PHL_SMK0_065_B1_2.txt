Now a day, we can see many adults are smoking in the streets, houses, restaurants and bars etc. even teenagers too. Teenagers learn to smoke because of the influenced of their friends. All we know that Smoking is a bad habit that can harm your health and will lead you to addiction. There are effects when your smoking: Lung cancer, Asthma and can cause many other cancers and illnesses because cigarettes contain chemicals and toxic substances that are harmful to the body. For me, Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it is not advisable to smoke inside the restaurant, it can harm the health of the customers inside the restaurants because even if you're not smoking and you are prone to smoke once you inhale it the smoke can damage your respiratory system is what they call the secondhand smokers. Most especially for the children their respiratory system is weak so they can easily be affected by the smoke and can cause them to death. By this, it can lessen the people who are affected by the smoke of the cigarettes and there will be a lesser number of deaths and who have lung cancer. So the Customer can eat well and enjoy inside the restaurant. They will be comforted.
