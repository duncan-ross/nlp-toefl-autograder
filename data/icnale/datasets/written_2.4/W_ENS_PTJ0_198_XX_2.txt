Part-time employment is a valuable investment of time for a student only if he or she can manage the extra demands it will place on their weekly schedules. As an instructor, it is my job to design challenging and thought provoking classroom and homework assignments, and if students cannot devote their attention to these fully due to the distracting influence of a part-time job, they should not waste their time on pursuits which do nothing to help them progress towards graduation. Certainly, part-time work can be a valuable way to gain experience and develop responsibility, but in most cases, these kinds of things should be reserved for summer break when students do not have to worry about classes. Furthermore, most schools and governments are very generous in their provision of scholarships, grants, and affordable loans. Students can take advantage of these to fund their tuition and personal expenses until they graduate. If they have done a good job in college, they can find a good job and pay off any debts they may have accrued in a quick and efficient manner. For these and many other reasons, I feel that students should not be so worried about finding part-time employment and giving themselves an excuse to feel stressed out.
