Since I was young, my parents have brought me up in an environment in which smoking was never condoned. Whenever we went out and somebody was smoking nearby, my father would stare disapprovingly at the person and give intermittent snorts to show his irritation. There were a few times when he almost got into fights with these smokers as a result, but fortunately nothing serious occurred due to my father's candidness. I actually agree with the stance that my father takes, because smoking is a vice that shouldn't be condoned. It causes air pollution, and it has been scientifically proven that second-hand smoke is very dangerous. Furthermore, cigarettes contain many addictive substances such as nicotine, which are bad for one's health. I know of many family friends who have attained diseases such as lung cancer due to continuous smoking. Smoking can cause so much harm to one's body and one's family (through second-hand smoke and the burden on one's family if one were to unfortunately obtain a disease), so why do people still smoke? Most of the time, habitual smokers are those who started from a very young age. For these young people, it's mostly due to peer pressure and the "cool" factor. In order to fit in with the "in" crowd and be socially accepted, teenagers feel that they need to smoke. Otherwise, they would be left out from the "cool" group. Well, this doesn't really make sense, right? But I suppose you wouldn't understand unless you were in the teenager's position.
