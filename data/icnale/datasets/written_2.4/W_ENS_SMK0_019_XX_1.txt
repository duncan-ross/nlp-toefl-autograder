Smoking is an absolutely disgusting habit, and I have no sympathy for the people who choose to destroy their bodies by smoking cigarettes. The fact that smoking is allowed at restaurants in Japan is simply astonishing given the otherwise forward thinking and technological advancement in that country. In a Japanese history class, I learned that Japan is usually quick to import the customs of other countries and adapt them into their own unique Japanese way. Many states in the United States of America have already banned smoking in public places including restaurants, and this would lead me to believe that Japan will eventually do so as well. It is simply a matter of time until enough people realize that it is simply not acceptable to have a habit that can directly affect the health of other people around you especially people you don't even know. It would seem that any sensible person would not want to give a complete stranger any kind of health problems especially ones as serious as the ones that accompany smoking and second hand smoke. If the Japanese follow the pattern of their own history which has already been established I think that it is only a matter of time before they follow the example set by the United States and ban smoking in all the public restaurants.
