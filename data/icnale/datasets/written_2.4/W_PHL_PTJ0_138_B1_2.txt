Being a student alone is already hard enough for most of us. But still there are those working-students who tediously study and work at the same time. It amazes me how they do it, besides already having a lot of work-load to do because of the demands of school assignments, yet they could still manage having a part-time job. Having a job while studying is real tough, it requires motivation to strive hard both at work and school, an outstanding mental attitude and physical capability for time- management so that one can do the tasks that needs to be finished, and of course, a lot of hard work and determination, to keep everything cool and controlled even though there are so many things to do. That is why having a job while still being a student should not be taken lightly. It is never easy working, plus the added pressure of getting high grades and doing well in school just adds up to the stress level. Normally, the people working while being students are those who are less fortunate that they first need to make an income for them to continue their studies. A lot of working-students take their allowances from their salaries at work because some of their parents, due to financial problems, cannot provide for their needs at school, while others simply do not have parents anymore and thus need to work in order for them to make a living. But it is really up to the student if he or she is willing to work even while studying. They just need to have the right mind and attitude in order for them to succeed. A well-motivated, hardworking student will make both a fine student and a well-spirited worker.
