From my point of view, college students should be concentrating on their studies and should not be holding a part time job during school term. This is based on the assumption that the financial situations of the family allows the student to fully concentrate on his or her studies. Unless the family is not able to support the student financially, every college student should not hold a part time job. In my opinion, the main aim of studying in a college is to gain new knowledge and to find out the student's real interest in order for him or her to proceed to a higher level of education in their field of interest. Hence, with the heavy workload in college, students should spend their time revising their school work and participating in school activities since it will be a part of memory that they could hardly achieve again in future. Part time jobs do provide the students with more work experiences, however, I believe these job experiences can be obtained after completing their studies. It may be recommended if the students hold a part time job during the school vacations, but during school term, it should not be recommended, unless necessary.
