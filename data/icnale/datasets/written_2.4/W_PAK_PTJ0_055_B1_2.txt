Every person in this world has some basic needs in common. One should have food, good clothes, good standard of living and good education. But all this can be got by one if one has sufficient money. And for money, one has to do jobs according to the law of nature. But due to the increase in world-poverty especially in some countries, the income of a single person is not sufficient to fulfil all the basic requirements. So, our young generation specially the college students, along with their study do the part time jobs to have better standard of living, each and everything better and better life style. The students of higher secondary level in comparatively backward areas in the world do part time jobs, but this activity interferes their study. They have to work hard enough. This interferes their health. For the progress of a country, its youth must be educated and strong. It must be strong enough to contribute a lot in making its society and country great. This all can be done if the government provides sufficient opportunities educate them, provide opportunities for their healthy activities and collect funds for them. Infect governments should provide opportunities for them to collect funds for them so they may also contribute to the progress of their society be paying attention on their studies.
