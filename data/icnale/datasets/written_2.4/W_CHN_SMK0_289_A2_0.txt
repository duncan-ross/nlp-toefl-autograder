 There are many people who like smoking, even in the public places they will take a cigarette in hand. Cigarette make them feel comfortable, but to the others around them, it is not comfortable at all. So, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Smoking, in my opinion, is totally unhealthy, especially in public places. It will not influence the smoker's own health, but is also bad for the people around. The researches show that, taking the second-hand smoking can damage people's health nearly equal to smoking by oneself. So it is not considerable nor responsible to smoke in public places. At the same time, the smoke coming from a burning cigarette can have bad influence on the environment. Public places belong to all the people, it is impolite and irresponsible to do damage to the public places' environment. The smoke can pollute the air. The burning cigarette can easily cause a fire. So it is better not to smoke in public places. Just think about our environment before lighting up a cigarette. So, from all above, we can see that smoking in public places is a really bad habit. If people no more smoking in public places, the environment will become better and there may be less fire happening. So, I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places.
