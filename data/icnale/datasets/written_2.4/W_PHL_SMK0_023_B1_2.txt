Smoking cigarettes in the public place must be strictly prohibited and especially to the restaurants wherein people are eating foods. This attitude is very a disrespectful to others and to the food. People must go outside and find a place which is smoking area then smoke. This is the right place. Smoking cigarettes is very dangerous in our health. It can cause fat deposits to narrow and block blood vessel which leads to heart attack. It is one of the reasons why people stroke and contributes to the number of cancer and many more. There are a lot of diseases or illness that we can get if the one person undergoes to the smoking cigarettes. As I said earlier smoking cigarette can cause of multiple diseases, what more id someone who did not smoke but he/she smells the fume or smell of the cigarette? In my own understanding about this case, secondhand smoke can cause also diseases but more than to the first smoker. They suffer to the diseases that they do not do anything! And smoker out there must know their limitations about the places where they undergo smoking. Many of our fellowmen will smell the fume of cigarettes (children, adult, pregnant, and innocent people) and they may suffer. All of us know what the effects of this cigarette are. And it must be banned and implemented to the country, Not only to the restaurants but in all public places.
