I agree to the non-smoking restaurant. The restaurant is a public place. If you smoke in many people will be exposed. The people inside the restaurant will be harmed. Will be weakened because the taste of cigarette smokes. Smoking is deadly to children and pregnant women. Would you like to smoke about now? If a restaurant allows smoking in the smoking to the health of people who do not play any more will not come to the restaurant. The restaurant will be full only of smokers. The restaurant will be filled with tobacco smoke; restaurant staff will become addicted to tobacco smoke. Later to leave the restaurant staff, guests also will not come. The restaurant will be shut down, more and more. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous. Once infected and sick people, and to die is exposed. Smoking in restaurants and other public places, not to subliminal. Those who smoke do not smoke should be induced. In order to help people this is never a good Seems like there is reliable. If smokers do not get this to think about other alternatives. One important problem is in society. The best thing is that nothing smokers. The city's air will be very different.
