I agree with the assertion that having a part-time job is important for college students. As college students enter into adulthood and lead independent lifestyles, it is only natural that their expenditures will increase. It would not be fair to burden one's parents and ask them to continue to provide pocket money for these expenditures, especially if they are nearing their retirement years. After all, our parents have taken good care of us since birth, and as mature college students, we have the onus to repay our parents by showing that we have indeed grown up to become smart and self-sufficient young adults. College timetables enable students to have a certain amount of flexibility in working part-time, and students can choose different types of jobs that fit their lifestyles. For instance, they can give tuition ad-hoc, which may be less demanding than waitressing at a restaurant for 20 hours a week. Even though they may only earn a few hundred dollars, it can still enrich their family's income and take a burden off their parents, especially if the family still has younger schooling children. However, though I recognise the importance of college students having part-time jobs, this is not always possible. In reality, many companies are reluctant to hire part-time workers as they perceive them as non-committal. Nonetheless, I still advocate for the value of part-time jobs, as it enables college students to gain working experience and have a taste of working culture, which may benefit them in their future employment prospects.
