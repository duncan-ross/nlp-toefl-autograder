I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, by banning smoking in restaurants, it will cause inconvenience to the smokes and deter them from dining in the restaurants. As such, it may influence them in a way such that they will consider the detriments of smoking in different aspects and attempt to abandon the bad habit of smoking. It provides an extra incentive for them to quit smoking. Secondly, smoking is bad for the health of smokers, but it creates a worse impact on the health of second-hand smokers. Therefore, by banning smoking in the restaurants, it increases the welfare of the diners who are non-smokers and allows them to dine in comfort without the risk of inhaling smoke. However, on the other hand, it may not be feasible to ban smoking in all restaurants as it will affect the businesses of the restaurants and may in turn, affect the economy growth. Also it may affect the sales of cigarettes, which is an important source of revenue for the government. To sum up, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it benefits the society in terms of welfare. Nevertheless, it is highly infeasible since it may cause an impact on the economy.
