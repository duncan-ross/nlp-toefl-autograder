I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job for many reasons. Firstly, college is not very easy to pay for, it takes up a large amount of money that our parents have to give up which is why they start saving up for our college fund very early. By getting a part time job, we can help them by lessening their expenses or even helping them out with household bills. Secondly, I think that a part time job would be a great opportunity for college students to make money for themselves, to start saving up for future needs and for paying for extra bills, most college students come from provinces and they have to travel to the city just to get quality education, with the help of a part time job we can make our own money to pay for housing and at least everyday food and needs. Lastly, I think that by getting a part time job it will help each student in developing traits such as discipline and time management which we need in the future when we start to have real full time jobs. Discipline and time management will also help a student in academic situations such as school work and following schedules.
