This goes against the very fabric of society and is absolutely ridiculous to think that any Government let alone Japan, thinks that this will be an effective long-term solution. This issue belongs in the private sector not the government and that is exactly where it should get sorted out. It really does smack of'Big Brother' imposing their will on everybody again. I am not sure about the Japanese constitution and I know that there are bans here in the UK as well as several other countries, but I disagree with them too. Why not allow the people and the restaurants to sort it out? After all, that's what the marketplace does best to sort the wheat from the chaff. Governments are already sticking their noses into far too many areas that don't concern them as it is and they need to be reigned in before they take over everything. Potential customers will cast their votes with their cash, they will either go to a smoking restaurant or they won't. I know that in the UK, we see big lines or groups of people standing out in the freezing cold just to have a smoke. Why do they have to do that? It's not necessary and will not solve the problem in the finish.
