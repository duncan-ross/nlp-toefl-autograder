I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because that smoking not only hurting the health of the man who smoke but also hurting the health of people who suffer from second-hand smoking. Although people have the freedom to do what they want to do accept that the things which are illegal. But smoking behaviors are totally effect the people around the smoking men or women. Cause the behavior not only makes the air dirty but also makes the people who have second-hand smoke upset. Moreover, the restaurant is the place we eat and enjoy the happiness with our families, friends and our lovers. The important and joy time should not be broken by the annoying smell of smoke. In my opinion, the smoker should find other way replace the smoking behavior. Maybe do some sport, read books even singing loudly can help one to get rid of the smoking. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only for the people like me who really do not like the smell of smoking, but also for the benefit to the health of the people who smoke.
