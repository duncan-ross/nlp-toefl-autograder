I extremely agree with the topic, don't you want to lost your nice feeling while sitting in the restaurants just cause by the smoker? Surely, most people in this planet think about themselves more than the others. So that is the cause to have nowadays crime. In the restaurants, there are many signs about "Don't Smoking"; you can see them in all of the poles and in the walls there. Banning about smoking in the restaurants must be having an extremely taboo for in first time, I think. How we can do it? At first, Have enough security guards, then show the sign note "Don't Smoking" and follow with "Fine (the most expensive pride) on one cigarette" Do that together with when someone or some people against that sign, Call the security guards to manage on them. If every restaurant can do that, nice feeling that leads someone going to go to restaurant where is the place for meeting with old friends, for dinner in the great time with the family, for celebrating with the victory, for dating with beautiful girl and nice boy, and especially for relaxing yourself with the great meal for charting energy in your body to doing your job excellently.
