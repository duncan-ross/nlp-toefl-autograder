I am a proponent of smoking, which I consider to be a detrimental activity to both the smoker and hapless non-smokers. Considering this, I agree totally with the statement that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. ? A plenitude of research has pointed out the deleterious effects of smoking, yet the smoking subculture remains a real and annoying part of everyday life. Weighing between health effects ranging from smokers' cough to bronchitis and lung cancer, brought about by the many carcinogenic materials found within the cigarette, and the purported "pleasure" and sense of "well-being", smokers opt for the latter. ? It is not their decision to smoke which causes my hackles to rise; instead, it is the way they engage in this harmful activity that I detest. Smokers often smoke at will, and anywhere seems like a good place for them to smoke. That I offer have to take in second smoke annoys me to no end. At to make matters worse, it is not as though I can always simply "avoid" the noisome fumes by "moving aside". Smokers ought to realise that there is such process as diffusion, which renders so many of us victims of cigarette smoke and so passive smoking! ? However, this much being said, I can only hope for bans of smoking in restaurants to be extended to coffeeshops, and by that, I mean, ALL parts of the coffeeshop, not just a corner of it, which, considering diffusion as mentioned, is simply daft.
