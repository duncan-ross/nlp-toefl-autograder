We always go to restaurants we eat, we drink and enjoyed conversations there together with our friends and family. Moreover, we also enjoyed seeing children laughs and enjoying eating their meals. But the problem now is how they can enjoy their foods if the sensation of eating is hack by the cigarette's smoke? No one can enjoy eating if something disturbs you able to harm these valuable moments of ours. I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at restaurants: not only inside but in the whole restaurant areas. Because lot of customers are affected especially children and elders who eat there are can easily got sick. They are harmed and choked of the unpleasant smell of the cigarette. And also secondhand smokers are the most harmed rather than the one who smokes. So because of them someone dies everyday unfortunately. We should keep are surroundings clean and beautiful. And we can only do that if we have respect to it and to our selves. We should also conserve our elder population because no one wants to lose there love ones. Just because one smoke one life is at risk, we should not waste our life and let's be healthy.
