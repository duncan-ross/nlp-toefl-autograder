I think smoking is a bad thing to every people. It can hurt a person. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers like smoke at everywhere, even a elevator or a small room. The smoke is very bad for us, but we can not avoid it. It is a good way to let us avoid the smoke is that banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country. This kind of way maybe let some people who are a smoker angry, but it could let us life without the smoke. For instance, my classmate, Ken, like to go to the restaurant "Food house" to have his lunch and dinner. But the "Food house" usually have some smokers to go to eat, the restaurant owner no stop them. Ken very hate smoke, so he doesn't go to the restaurant even this shop's food is his favorite. He tells me, if he should stay in a shop which is full of smoke, he rather than go to a restaurant which food tasty bad but the restaurant have no smoke. So, I think maybe smoking banned completely in a restaurant is a good idea for every people except smokers. .
