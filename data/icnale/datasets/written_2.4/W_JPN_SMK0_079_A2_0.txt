I agree with this opinion, because smoking is bad for health. In a restaurant, there are many people, so smoking is very annoying for non-smoking person. Smoking is bad for smoking person, but tobacco's fog do more harm for others. However nonsmokers can't avoid the fog at the restaurants, because they are having foods. I'm not willing to sit down near to smoker's seats. If there are many smokers in a restaurant, I won't go to the restaurant. If smoking is banned at all the restaurants in the country, it is sure for us to feel cozy. We don't have to worry about tobacco's problem at the restaurant, and we can concentrate in eating. I think that smokers should smoke outside or separated place. It will keep our health. It is difficult to ban smoking at all the restaurants, but it is possible. In German, smoking is banned at all the restaurants! Germany says Germany obeys the rule of no smoking at the restaurants, so we can do such a thing. This fact shows us that if we have a will, smoking can be banned at all the restaurants in the country! I think that we Japanese should follow Germany when it comes to smoking problem. We should be active to be healthy.
