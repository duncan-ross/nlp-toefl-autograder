For university students, there are much freedom for them to choose what they want to do. I agree that university students have a part-time job if they can strike a well balance between studies and doing the part-time job. University students can be beneficial a lot from having a part-time job. First, they can get valuable working experience. People with much working experience can be easier to adapt to working environment and do the job well. Under the efficiency-based society, most of the employers do not want to spend much time and many resources for training any fresh university graduates. Thus, if university students have much more working experience, they will be easier to get a well-paid job. Second, doing a part-time job is one of the incomes for university students. For those poor university students, doing a part-time job can help to pay their tuition fees; for others, they can use the earning money to buy reference books for improving their studies or buy some things they like. Third, university students can realize what they lack after the part-time job. If university students do not know what abilities or skills they are not good enough, it will be hard for them to work in society and even cannot find a job. After doning part-time jobs, university students understand more what they really need to be prepared and get equipped themselves as soon as possible. To conclude, it is definitely good for university students to have a part-time job. By reflection themselves and experience for the real-life situation, university students can develop more fully and have a promising future.
