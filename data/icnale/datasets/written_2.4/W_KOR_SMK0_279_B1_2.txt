A cigarette is regarded as a favorite food so smoking that is enjoying the favorite food is not illegal behavior. However, there have been many countries which ban smoking in public places. I' also think smoking in public places should be banned especially in the restaurants. I want to talk about the reasons in two aspects. First reason is that not being exposed to smoking is definitely one's right like the right to smoke for the smokers. If we have to make order on what should be preceded by among the two rights, I think it is the first not to be exposed to smoke. Therefore, people can enjoy their meal without smelling cigarette smoke in restaurants as well as other public places. Second reason is that smokers should not make harm on other people to enjoy their favorite food. There are other more important things such as others' health and feeling than smoking. So smoker should keep enough distance from non-smokers when smoking. I don't mean everyone should stop smoking in every place. What I mean is non-smokers' right should be first, not the smokers'. To keep non-smokers' right and health, I think there should be restrictions on smoking in some public places.
