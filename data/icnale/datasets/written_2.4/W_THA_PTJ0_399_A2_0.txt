I think this is It is good for students to have part-time jobs. I think this is very common that students do part-time jobs while studying in foreign universities. It's obvious that if you don't work, you will have more time to study, but doing a job can get you some income to survive or get some pocket money without depending on parents. Research has shown that those students who work while studying tend to understand and grasp their studies much better than those who are not on job. They understand the nature of business and get a practical learning about how things are done. For example if a student is studying telecommunications and works at a call center, he will understand each and every thing much better. However students working while studying should definitely not divert from their studies and keep a balance between their studies as well as job.
