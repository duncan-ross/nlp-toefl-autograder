Nowadays, students in college have a lot of spare time in school. Some of them choose to take a part time job to spend their time. Also, there's another voice that against students taking part time jobs. Today, we'll talk about this. First, I'd like to say that I'm very interested in college students taking part time jobs. I'm a grade-one college student. Except going to classes, I have a lot of time in my dorm. When winter comes, I have to stay at my dorm, playing games with my roommates or surfing the Internet. Whenever I play the games, I always recall of my dad and mum's words telling my to work hard in college when I leave home, but my roommates are so passionate that I can't stop playing with them. How to solve the problem without hurting our relationship? I think to go out and take a part time job is a good idea, at least you're not wasting your valuable adolescence time. Taking part time job is to be great beneficial. One can gain experience while make money when taking part time job. The experience in working is very competitive when you graduate and find a real job. You're an grown-up if you're in the college, I think your parents will be glad if they know that you're making money in college, and taking part time job is an excellent chance! People often comment that the after-1990s generation a failure and disgusting in China. I think they are mainly referring to the naughty college students. Our college students really should do something to prove that we are better than they foresaw. If everybody tries to take a part time job, the society may change.
