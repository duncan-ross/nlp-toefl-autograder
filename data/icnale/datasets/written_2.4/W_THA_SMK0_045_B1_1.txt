Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this opinion because smoke is dangerous for everyone who breathes it not only who is smoking. The smog is composed of many hazardous chemical substants. I used to know that there are more than 500 dangerous substants in smog. Moreover, the restaurant is the place where people go there to have meal. So, if someone smokes, the smog could make other people, who are eating, mad because of its smell and also destroy their health, too. Customers may be don't want to go that restaurant again. I think the government have to launch the law about this problem not only in the restaurant but also in the school and public places. In addition, smoke could cause unpredictable situation such as fire etc. So banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is the good solution but it's ought to hard to do because many people like to smoke after had meal. But, I think if all restaurants can do it, it must be good for customers and image of the country. And other country can use this idea to develop their country, too.
