I agree and I think that a lot of people also agree. It has been successfully argued and proved in the courts that second-hand smoke is just as dangerous to a non-smoker as it is to a smoker. If we already know that and I believe that Japan does too, then this seems to be the next logical step to take in the fight against smoking diseases. It is no longer a case of who is wrong and who is right or who is being victimized and who is not. The jury is in and the verdict is given every single day around the world, as people die and the death rate climbs higher and higher until the pain to those who are left behind becomes too much and finally, we start to see meaningful changes in laws and people. Why is it necessary to go through a disaster so that people are able to wake up and smell the roses? It shouldn't have to be that way but unfortunately, that is the reality of the human race. Bans have been reasonably effective to date and I see no reason why they will not be as effective when applied to Japanese restaurants.
