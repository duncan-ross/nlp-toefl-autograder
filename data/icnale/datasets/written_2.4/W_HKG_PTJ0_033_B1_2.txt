Seemingly, a heated debate between two parties about the issue – the importance of university students having part-time jobs – is becoming a more and more popular. On the standpoint of university students, having part-time jobs would be an opportunity to expose to valuable experience. On the other side from the sociologists, having part-time jobs would be a hurdle blocked the academic development of the university students. Therefore, we should make a compromise between the pros and cons of the parties in order to make a decision. No doubt, putting too much effort in part-time jobs would affect the living modes of the university students in some extent. However, taking part-time jobs of different variety would allow one to have an opportunity to make friends, to deal with people, and to learn other interests. This opportunity makes life more enjoyable. Moreover, part-time jobs would be a source of income. Nowadays, the admission fee of the university although is not very high to some people, it would be a burden to some low-income family. Having part-time jobs would be a method to relieve the loads of burden from the admission fee. Moreover, most of the university students have been sitting in the classrooms or lecture theatres for almost six hours, facing the whiteboard. Part-time jobs would allow the university students to do something different for a change. Leisure is essential for the development of the students as well. It is somewhat like a piece of succulent steak, studying is like its protein. They both have to be present in the steak to make the dish enjoyable.
