As many as forty percent man and eight percent women smoke regularly. Smoking is today to be the biggest dieses. The life of smoker is cut short 10-12 years and more then half of all Smokers die from smoking is a slow killer. It has become fashionable in the world today to condemns smoking so I do not thing it should be banned completely. A further point is that government's thought the world make huge pacifist from taxes of cigarettes. You can go for laser therapies or consume herbal tea. you must take carefully after your quit smoking. If you have any element you must meat to your physician and check if it because of quit smoking. For many year governments have tired to reduce smoking. but it not be successful to ban it completely. While there is no doubt smoking is very bad for you some are happy to continue. I don't think it should be banned through the legal system. it should be the choice of the restaurant go non smoking but at least a few would still keep on the tables. Some says that better yet the market at the very least there should be a Ban on all tobacco.
