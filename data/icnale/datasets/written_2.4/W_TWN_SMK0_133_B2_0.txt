I totally agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Somebody might say that it is their freedom for those smokers to smoke cigarettes at any time and any place; however, they can not control the smokes of the cigarettes to flow, especially to where the people dislike the smell of cigarettes. What's more, the concept of being much healthier without smoking is also a main reason for persuading people to quit this bad habit; however, the smokers may complain that the bodies are theirs, it is not our business to interfere their habit for relaxing themselves by "hurting themselves" with cigarettes. Nevertheless, they can not control the dangerous smoke flow to those people who care about their bodies. When people are eating, they also abstract the air from outside to inside; therefore, if somebody is smoking at this moment, the uncomfortable and toxic smells and smokes will enter their bodies as well. I think although those smokers claim that they have the right to smoke, it is obvious that they can not control the uncontrollable smokes to flow to those who do not want this hateful smell, especially when eating. Therefore, though smokers have the right to enjoy cigarettes, they also need to respect the will of those who just want a clear place to eat their meals without the annoying cigarettes' smells and smokes. To sum up, it is indeed needed to totally ban people from smoking in the restaurants.
