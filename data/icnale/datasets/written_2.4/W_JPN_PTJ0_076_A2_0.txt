I agree that college students have part time jobs. Do we only study in college? No, I don't think that. Of course if you work in part time jobs too hard and don't study in college, it is too bad but part time job in itself is not bad thing, because I will show you why it is. First, you can experience many things that you can't experience in college. For example you can teach math, English and science for high school or junior high school students. In part time job, you can discover your new sides. Second, we can enter new community. For example senior manager will tell you how to communicate customers, also you must tell youngers it too. Finally you will utilize its experiences for your own work in the future. Of course what you have learned in college is the most important to enter a company which you want to enter. But after entering, you may utilize what you have learned in part time job. If you don't have its experiences, you can't cope with many kinds of works or problems, for example how to communicate olds or youngers or solve some accidents which you don't think happens, however if you have it, you can act quickly and flexibly. Part time jobs have these good sides so college students work, if they don't forget to study.
