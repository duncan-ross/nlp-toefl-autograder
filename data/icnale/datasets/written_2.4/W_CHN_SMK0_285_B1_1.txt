As smoking is such a harmful and selfish habit that I think it should be totally banned in public places. Smoking is harmful not only to the smokers, but also to people around them. If someone smokes in the public places, such as restaurants, or underground station, everyone around him will be forced to take in the second-hand smoke. According to the research, second-hand smoke is even worse than smoke. Even a single person smokes in public places, all the people around him will be harmed by cigarettes. Smoking also will ruin people's appetite and mood. Imagine someone is smoking while you are having delicious food. How unpleasant could it be! It's such a selfish behavior because the smoking person may feel good but people around him will be very uncomfortable. Further more, not smoking in the public places can also show people's respect because nobody will feel good if someone is smoking while talking to him, or even being around him. In my opinion, not smoking should be a kind of social manner. Smoking in the public is a bad habit that should be discouraged. If no one is smoking in the public places, then the air will be fresher, food will be more delicious, and people will be more friendly.
