I think is appropriate for most college students to have a part-time job and it is also very important for them to do so. One reason I think this is because I have been working at a part-time job for most of my college career. A part-time job has allowed me to make many connections which helped me in usually unexpected ways, and sometimes I feel very lucky, but I also realize that all the hard work I do is really what has helped me get so far. Next, other students, your professors, and your parents will respect you more if you try to have a part-time job because it shows that you are responsible and know enough about the world to be mature and try to make some money for yourself and do something for yourself. However, I do not think it is a good idea for students that do not have enough time to find part-time work because the grades will definitely suffer if they tried to put too many things into their schedules. The small amount of money you can make at a part-time job is not worth sacrificing your performance in classes, as any advanced degree student will tell you. In conclusion, college student should have a part-time job if they think they can manage the stresses they may encounter.
