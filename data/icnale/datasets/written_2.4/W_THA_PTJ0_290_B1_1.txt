I agree with topic A because an allowance from parents may not enough in some month so we should have a part-time job to get more extra money. For all students who are not rich enough how do they buy their new clothes monthly if without more money that over used from their allowance. For example you must buy something for your friend in the end of a month but your mom could not give you dollars to buy it because it too expensive and not important to buy, so what would you do? Of course you need more money you should work to get money for many special ceremonies like farewell party, Freshmen night hosted by your faculty. All these ceremonies make you to get wonderful dress so you can use money from your job to buy it easily which is better than beg from your mom. Sometimes not only that special ceremony there are many things to but for your education at university like books pens if you can buy it by yourself you and your family will be pround of you and love you more than the last time you have ever paid by your mom's money.
