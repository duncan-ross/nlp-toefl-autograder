Many people smoke in the world. Though a lot of people think that smoking should be banned, the number of smokers still increases. In my opinion, I think smoking should be forbidden for that it is bad for many aspects. First of all, smoking is bad for people's health. It is common knowledge that smoking is not good for one's health. Many people die lung cancer. And the habit of smoking is one of the most significant reasons for causing such kind of disease. There is no doubt that people who don't smoke have the lower possibility to suffer this disease. Secondly, the smoke released from the burning cigarettes is also bad for the people who breathe in it. There are many kinds of poisonous chemicals in the smoke, so if a person smokes in a public place, he is not just doing bad things to his own health, he is harming others' health as well. Last, people who smoke must spend a lot of money buying cigarettes every year. With the money that one buys cigarettes, he can do many other things. Even he can give part of the money to the charity. That is much better than spending money buying cigarettes which is bad for health. To conclude, smoking has a lot of bad aspects. And I think that smoking should be banned in the near future.
