 Whether college students should do part time job? really puzzles many socialists, college teachers and students as well. For me, I truly support the idea that college students should do some part time jobs. And here are some reasons below. Being a college student, we shouldn't spend all his time studying like a middle school student. Although study is a very important part in college life, gaining some social experience is also essential. We can join a lot of societies or students' organizations; do some volunteer work or some part time jobs. Doing a part time job not only makes you earn some pocket money and enrich social experience but also helps you to make progress all the time and form good habits such as time keeping, being responsible and saving money after your hardworking. Many college students will go to work after graduation. So it is absolutely an advantage if you have some working experience when you apply for a job than others. And nowadays social and working experience is required in many job applications. And I do think it important to find fun or curiosities when doing part time job otherwise you will frustrate and give up halfway easily. In the end, doing a part time job is good for us in most part. And I sincerely hope that each college student can lead a meaningful and colorful college life.
