When you are the college students that mean you are older. The college students should be more responsibility for everything such as your life, your learn and your money. Most college students always pay a lot of money for useless things; new cloths, new shoes, cosmetics and parties. Some students have rich families, but others haven't. So they have to do a part-time job. I disagree for it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think if you reduce the useless activities, you can save a lot of money. Learning in college is very hard, so you should concentrate and attend the class. But the part-time job has good advantages. You will have more experience from the classes and you can use it for applying for the job in the future. You should save your money because in the future, you have to make your good life, buy the house, buy the car, get marry, etc. And in the other hands, a part-time job can make you a good employee. You must be on time for the job, have abilities for work skills, have good work ethics, and get along well with your co-worker.
