I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, and I have 3 reasons to account for it. First of all, as college students, having a part-time job can enhance our abilities in various fields. College life should not only involve learning lessons but also provide students for a space to find out their interests, bring themselves into play and practice their abilities. I had a part-time job this summer as a private tutor, and I do feel that it does good to me. So having a part-time job is essential. Secondly, having a part-time job brings benefit to college students by showing them the society. Students can learn to get accustomed to working and gradually know about the society. It is obvious that it can't be learned in our lessons. Last but not least, having a part-time job is somewhat a symbol of growth. Only by working can you realize how hard your parents are. In addition, parents will be happy if they know that you can pay some of your tuition yourself. That's not a problem of money, but consideration and independence. For all these reasons mentioned above, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Try to find one right now!
