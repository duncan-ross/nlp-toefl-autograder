Smoking should be banned in all public places in every country right now! The sooner the better because I work in the health care industry and I get to see first-hand, the affects of smoking and the damage that it causes. The number of deaths in New Zealand has risen sharply in the past two years and also the number of smoking related health issues. People are not forced to smoke, it is not compulsory and the number of deaths that it causes is completely preventable. All governments, including the Japanese Government are also aware of the medical statistics that show clearly that the death rate is climbing and illnesses caused by smoking, even passive smoking, are at an all time high. I fail to understand how any responsible government could allow this to continue and turn a blind eye or wait and see what the next survey/poll results are. It's disgusting that smoking is allowed in public eating places, polluting the very food that people are paying to eat. More and more non-smoking restaurants are popping up all over the place and we teach our children in school about the dangers of smoking, yet governments are reluctant to take a stronger position on this issue and just say no more. If a pack of cigarettes was filled with twenty terrorists or even suspected terrorists, how fast would governments act? To me, there is no difference to a pack of twenty smokes or a pack of twenty terrorists. They are all killers and a danger to the public.
