People say that college life is one of the most important events of one's life. It is the point wherein the students will be trained to act like adults. In my opinion, college students should not have part-time jobs simply because they should be focused on their studies. Having a part-time job will decrease the time one can spend on studying because it will be really hard for the students to manage their time and will also make you feel tired due to the extra effort the student has to exert. If, for example, the students will go to school from 8:00am to 4:00pm then will work part-time for 3 hours a day, that will leave them with only a couple of hours left to study and do the assignments. But you also have to take in to consideration that they will still have to eat and travel going home which will decrease more of their time to study. On the other hand, if the students will proceed home after school, they will still have an ample amount of time to study and do their assignments. If the people really want the students to have a part-time job then I would suggest that the students should do it during the summer where they do not have to worry about school.
