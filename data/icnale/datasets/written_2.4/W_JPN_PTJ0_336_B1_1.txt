I agree with the idea it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons for it. First, college students often need money. Many students live alone near the college and need money for living alone. If a student's family is rich, he may be helped by his family for all money he needs. However, most students are not in such situation, so they should have a part-time job. Second, college students should experience many things in college days. College students should study hard, but they have much time they can use freely. So, they use such time for not only studying but also part-time job. Working will teach them many important things, relationships with people in places they work and the difficulty of earning money for themselves. Third, college students will come to use money well by earning and using money for themselves. College students should learn not only study of college but also how to use money well because college students are just students but they are adults in point of view of their age. So, I agree the idea it is important for college students to have a part-time job by this 3 reasons.
