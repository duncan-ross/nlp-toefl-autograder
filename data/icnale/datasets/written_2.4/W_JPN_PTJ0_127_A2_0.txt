I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We can learn the society, economy, and what we must have as adults through a part-time job. We will have to work to earn in the close future. If we have much ability which I give before than other people, we can be recognized earlier and can have a big work. And if we cannot make use of the experience of a part-time job to our work, we can make use of it to our life. We cannot live alone, so we have to have communication ability. A part-time job is also needed it. Therefore if we are not good at communicating, we get to communicate well thanks to having a part-time job. I was also not good at doing but I entered the university and have a part-time job then I can communicate better than I used to. As another reason, I think we can learn how difficult we get money and how important money is through a part-time job. If we haven't work, we cannot understand importance of money. We know it, and we can know the importance of parents who grow us up. We can know the greatness of parents when we work. By these reason, I think we have to have a part-time job.
