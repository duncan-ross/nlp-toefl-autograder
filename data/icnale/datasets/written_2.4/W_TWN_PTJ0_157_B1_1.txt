Many students at my age want a part time job to make more money. They not only want to buy more beautiful tings but also want to be mature; however, take a pare time job at my age is very dangerous, you could be deceived or work so much but get a little money. For me, I had a part time job just seven days ago. It was a terrible experience because my boss asked us go far away to business stores, you probably be rejected. I am not good at sociability, so I quite the job seven days later. I got five thousand dollars and I felt satisfied. This is not my first part time job. My first part time job was at a cram school, also not a simple place, since I was a junior high school student. As a student, I could only help answer the telephone and do odds and ends. I was not a patient person, so I quite, I only worked three weeks. I want to try something new. I stopped finding part time jobs and went to Taipei, I bought many things I love angd had a lot of fun with my best friend. It became a good memory for me except locked the door and working and working. Although I had to pay for my buying, I used my scholarship but not my mother or money from part time job. I don't agree with having a part time job. Believe me or not, the most fortunate is that I am a student! I don't have any pressure to think about working, I can do only study and practice. I have much free time to do what I want to do. At last, I want to say, don't get any part time job and do anything you like as much as possible! When you have really enough ability, just find a job for your old age!
