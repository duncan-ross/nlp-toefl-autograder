I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons to support my view point. As we all known that restaurant is a public place for everyone, it is not someone's private pace. So if you can't help smoking, please go back to your home and there nobody will complain anything to you. It is also common sense that if one smokes at a restaurant, the others will turn to the second-hand smokers and the harm o them is much greater than that to the smoker. Also, restaurant is a place of pleasure and happiness. Many parents choose to encourage and reward their children by taking them to a favorite restaurant. Imaging that you and your children are enjoying your food while someone besides begin to smoke, what a disappointment! Your children may turn to be angry or even feel disappointed at the society. So smoking in the restaurant is no longer a personal problem, it is actually a matter of the whole society. Everyone wants to enjoy himself at the restaurants, so why don't we put the good wish into action. Let's speak aloud No smoking at restaurants from now on.
