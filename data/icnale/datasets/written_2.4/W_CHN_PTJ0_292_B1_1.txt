As a college student, he is no longer the child he has ever been. We can't always depend on our parents, it is the time that we should do something to make a living by ourselves. Maybe we are still out of the ability to maintain our own living, but we at least should have a try. Most of us may choose waiter as our part-time job during our vocation or even at weekends for its convenience. It's great, as a waiter you can touch many different kinds of people, increasing your experience which can't be provided by the college. Furthermore, what we should learn during our college period is not only the knowledge from the book, but the skill to cooperate with others and the method to enter the society. Part-time job gives you a chance to touch the hardness and the stress of the social life which can give you some directions on the way of your life. Most of us are the only child in our family, we don't pay much attention to the importance of the money since our childhood. Part-time job can teach us how hard it is to make money, I think nobody can do better than it in this area. In brief, I think It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
