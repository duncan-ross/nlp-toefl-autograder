I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To have a part-time job not only can make college life more colorful but also help ourselves when we find jobs in future. Besides to join activities and clubs hold by college to cultivate our interest positively, finding a part-time job is also a good way to make friends. Whether being a waiter or waitress in the restaurant or being a tutor to teach little students. Both of them can let us know new friends in different field and increase our social experience. Of course, the biggest advantage is that we can earn money after our hard work. And storing money we can buy what we want, and even go aboard! Though many college students don't have economic problems, I consider that if a college student, who never has a work experience, will be consider being a little strawberry. As if many adults usually think we are unable to stand any difficult things when challenge come! Moreover, because some parents are too spoiled there children and give them too much money to buy luxury item, leading these children don't know that earning money is not easy. In short, to prove we are not strawberries and being like an independent adult, finding a part-time job is very important.
