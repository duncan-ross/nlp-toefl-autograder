Nowadays, given the crises that our economy experiences, even students are compelled to work to be able to support themselves. Lucky for them, most universities allow specialized schedules which make the probabilities of the time allotment for their subjects and for their part-time jobs coincide lesser. Part-time workers are also usually not given heavy workloads; most part-time jobs involve only easy tasks such as tending to a cash register or keeping an inventory of stocks a retail business. As a student, I position myself halfway between agreeing and disagreeing. For me, a part-time job not only enables a student to gain income in order to support himself, but also trains him to be more responsible and more efficient in managing his time in order to be able to cope with harder tasks in the future. On the contrary, I, myself, also find it very hard to manage my time: cramming during the last minute, barely making the deadline and not bothering to do assignments at home – I copy most of my assignments from my blockmates during breaks; so I think having to do two take care of these two things – studying and working – at once, must be a very hard thing to do. There is also less time to enjoy or do things at a leisurely pace if one decides to engage in a part-time job. At the end of the day, it is best considering the capabilities and the priorities of the students so as to make sure whether he will be able to handle tending to studying and working at once. After all, the dog who barked for a larger piece of meat than what he had only lost his own and gained nothing.
