Smoking in public area has been a huge issue in our society for a long time, and because of that, it is becoming illegal in many countries in the world. As it is well known, smoking is bad for smoker himself, but also very harmful people near him. Even though it has been banned from many public areas, we still see people smoking in restaurants, where people eat, rests, and have a conversation. It is not right to smoke in restaurants, and it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Like I mentioned, smoking is harmful to people near, not just to smoker himself. It is found that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking. Smokers do not have right to harm non smokers, who are not happy to be harmed. Restaurant is a public place for everyone, and if people start to smoke, non smokers in the restaurant inevitably breathe all the harmfulness in the cigarette. That is why it should be banned. Let's say that there is a happy pregnant woman in the restaurant, having a meal and a conversation. If one person starts to smoke in the restaurant, he is harming the woman and a baby inside of her, and disturbing the happiness the pregnant woman enjoying in the meal. Is this something that should be happening?
