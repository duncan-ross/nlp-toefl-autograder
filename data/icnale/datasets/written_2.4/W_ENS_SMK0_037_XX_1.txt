Smoking is a filthy and disgusting habit. For this reason, it is my sincere hope that one day smoking will become much rarer than it is now. Even in the U. S., I feel that too many people smoke, but I was lucky enough to be able to go to Tokyo, Japan, for one week for vacation last year. The amount of smoking there even in public places like restaurants simply horrified me. It was very hard to enjoy time on my vacation with my Japanese friends because the air was literally so smoky that sometimes I felt like I was going to be sick. This is a feeling that no one should have to experience, and everyone should be able to go to a restaurant that is clean and smoking free so that they can enjoy themselves. They should establish some smoking areas so the smokers have a designated place where they can freely enjoy their still disgusting and very dirty habit but without bothering other people. If all the restaurants in Japan were to ban smoking, they may be able to increase their profits because more families would be encouraged to go to the restaurants because they were cleaner. Also, this decision may help some people who are trying to quit smoking to give them a slight push in the direction they need to finally kick this terrible habit.
