As a college student of Adamson University, I think having a part time job for college students is necessary especially to those who have problems financially, is also necessary to have an experience or to afford something you like in other words for additional expenses. Having a part time job is a hard thing do if you are a college student, its more hard if you're already have a profession or a permanent job, a part time job is just temporary because, first, it is just a part time and not permanent, second and last, part time job is to solve your problems financially. Here in Adamson University there are many college students having a part time job as a Student assistant in a given department to them, in my observation, being an Student assistant is very hard part time job because, there is pressure and they are irregular students because they must have a time to do their job, considering it as a hard work, at least they can manage it with pressure, of course, they are Adamsonians and they can do it properly and successfully. Me, I like to have a part time job to even though I don't have problems financially, I want to have because I like to buy what i want like cellphones, eat in fabulous restaurants, watch high rated movies etc.
