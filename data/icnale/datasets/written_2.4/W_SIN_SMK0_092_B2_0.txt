I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, especially so for restaurants that are air-conditioned or have al fresco dining options where customers can eat in the open. I believe everyone including smokers themselves know the disadvantages of smoking. Studies have been done to analyze the awareness of smokers about the detrimental impacts that smoking has on their health, and it has been proven that they indeed know what they are doing to their body, at least have an idea so. That being said, many people are also aware of the disadvantages of second-hand smoking and thus we should prevent this from happening much as we are able to since second-hand smoking is not something that we can avoid by choice. Although smoking bans may invade on the rights of the smoking population, however I feel that we need to instill in the smokers a sense of responsibility to the public and society at large. Restaurants especially, are particular about hygiene and if there are large amounts of smokers who crowd the al fresco dining area, then restaurant owners may lose out on a lot of the non-smoking patrons and this proves detrimental to not to the restaurant but the public as well as they are not able to enjoy dining ambiences that are meant for them to enjoy.
