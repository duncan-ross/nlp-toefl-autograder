I strongly agree that smoking should be banned not only in a restaurant but all places especially the public one. Besides it is not good for health, it may disturb other persons who don't smoke. Lots of smokers does not care about their surrounding, they smoke wherever they wanted to without care how much people are bother with it or not. In restaurants and cafes, there are lots smokers disturbs other customer who does not smoke, as a reason, lots of non-smokers complaint and decrease their oftenest going to restaurants and cafes where lots of smokers will be there. If restaurants and café do not prohibit it, they will lose lots of customer. Although restaurants or cafes separate the smoking and non-smoking room, it still may bother. Restaurant which does not have a smokers tend to look clean and not messy, it will invite more customer than usual. If restaurants do not want to lose both smokers and non-smokers customer they should provide a special outdoor room for the smokers, so that both the customer feels comfortable with the environment of the restaurants and café. For example, in Singapore, there are some restaurants that have a special place for smoking. It would be pleased for smokers to smoke freely.
