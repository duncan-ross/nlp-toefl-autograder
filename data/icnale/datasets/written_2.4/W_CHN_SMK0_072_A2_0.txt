Smoking is a common activity in everyone's life. No matter who smoke, you cannot always avoid it. And the attitude to smoking is varied from people to people. In my opinion, smoking should be limited but shouldn't be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking can make people relaxed sometime. Especially for many businessmen under heavy stress, they need a convenient way to relax themselves. Smoking just can help them and keep them in a good condition. Secondly, for sure, smoking may be unhealthy to the smokers and the people around them. But smoking or not smoking is a private choice; we can't completely forbid it in all the restaurants. Just set a special place for these smokers in the restaurants can solve the problem too. Thirdly, if the smoking is banned completely in the restaurants, it must lead to terrible destroy in the cigarette industry. Many workers may lose their jobs and it will influence the economy of our society. So in conclusion, smoking should be limited in the restaurants but not banned completely in the restaurants. We just try to have a special place for smokers in the restaurants now and it will do less harm to non-smokers.
