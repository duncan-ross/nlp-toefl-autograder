Nowadays, many people like to smoke cigarettes although they know that it is bad for their health. Additionally, smoking is not only bad for the health of people who smoke it, but it is also bad for other people health. For example, there is someone smoke cigarette in the park and a lady who get pregnant is sitting beside; the smokes exactly destroy the health of three people (a person who is smoking, the lady, and her baby). Therefore, it will be very good if people can give up smoking. In other words, if they cannot give up smoking, they should do it in their place where people do not come. To do this, it will help to reduce the problems of disease from smoking such as a cancer. There are many places that people should not smoke. Some places have been completely banned already such as the parks, the hospitals, and some official places. However, there are some places that should be banned but people still smoke. That is some restaurants, because the restaurants are the place that people come for food. Restaurants is a good one place that should be clean and have good atmosphere because it can use for organization meeting or family meeting and use for relaxing. They sometimes take their children to go to the restaurants too. As a result, if there are people who smoke in the restaurants, the people who come to the restaurants for food will get the danger from smoking too. It is not fair for them to get the danger from the thing that they do not do it, especially the children who are innocent. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country
