Nowadays many countries in the world have passed laws to ban smoking in public places like restaurants. But some smokers still claim that their rights are infringed if smoking is forbidden in public places. However, most non-smokers regard the ban as good news. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all the public places such as restaurants, theaters and public squares. Fisrt of all, smoking is harmful both for smokers themselves and others. It is reported that every year smoking causes lung cancer and millions of death around the world. Secondly, smoking pollutes the air. Just imagine that you sit in a restaurant full of smoke, how can you enjoy your meal there? Besides, smoking is bad for the elevation of a country's image in the world. Mostly important of all, smokers must show their respect to those who don't smoke even if it's quite difficult for smokers to hold their smoking desire for a while. Because they have to stand on others' shoes. I think the world will be better than before. I believe if smoking is banned in all the public places, most of us will breathe in more fresh and clean air. And the health condition of all the people will be greatly improved.
