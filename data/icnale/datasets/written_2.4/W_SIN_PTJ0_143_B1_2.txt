College students are often seen having part time jobs aside from their academic commitments, but mostly because they need the extra pocket money. These teenagers are often in transition to their early adulthood and would have a more acute awareness of their finances, coupled with a high spending propensity on needs and wants. However, there are other part time jobs college students could hold for non-financial gratification. Thus, on this level, it is important for college students to have part time jobs to support themselves and also for experience. Most importantly, it could be a headstart to their working life upon graduation, should they invest their time and effort in a job they are passionate in. However, they must not allow their primary role as a student to be relegated due to this new commitment. The importance of college students having part time jobs is made striking when they realise the working society differs from their school life by a huge measure. Often, their first foray into the economic realm is both exciting and daunting, depending on their choice of work. Should there be significant and substantial learning points in their course of work, these students would have added value to their college lives and also, advantageously illuminated their resume with their newly created wealth of experience.
