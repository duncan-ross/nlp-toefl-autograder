Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country to maintain its cleanliness and safety of our health. We all know that smoking is dangerous to our health. Cigarettes are composed of tobacco. This contains nicotine; it is the reason why people who smoke get addicted to it. Pregnant women who smoke is not good for their health/babies and can also cause death of their babies. There are also a lot of young people who learn and get experience from the adults who smoke which they can see in public places. Adults who smoke should hide from their children whenever they smoke. We can't please all of the people not to smoke. We should also respect their feelings what they wanted to do. They should just think first of the right places where they can smoke without young adults. Restaurants that banned smoking at their place help their business to grow. Protecting the customers health is going to be a benefit of the restaurant. Because for example, if you had a customer who gets sick because of the smoke pollution, it's going to be a problem at their business. Having a policy that no smoking in the restaurants will help also your country to be famous. As a citizen in your country you can also help to less the air pollution.
