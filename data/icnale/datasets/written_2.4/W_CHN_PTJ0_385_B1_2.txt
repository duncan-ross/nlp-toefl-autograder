Of all the changes that have taken place in college campus during the past thirty years, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the growing emphasis on students' capacity of making money. Some state that contemporary students should make money as early as possible in order to get used to the marketization. At the same time, more and more scholars plaint that gone forever are the days when students devote themselve to pursuing knowledge, claiming that college has become a place where the youth learn to adapt to society in advance and once the admiration towards money and fame become a head-long trend, our development of science will decline. Each student has his/her own choice, and whether participating in part-time job or not depends on individual situations. But as we discover so many students spending so much time doing part-time jobs rather than studying while their jobs has no relationship with their majors, a question is raised:what should a student do first? It is difficult for the average student now to imagine a time when college students were trusted as genius to do advanced research. As higher education embrace more and more people, college students are no more than well-educated labors, but education prices have beening keeping rising. So it is quite easy to understand part-time job is more and more popular. But as well known, colleges contain various learning resourses, making it the most admirable studying enviroment for scholars in China, and quite a few masters said the college period was a golden time for studying because that's a pure time for thinking as well as learning. Unfortunately, the college campus is no longer that peaceful because so many students are engaged in their job. But please remember, we have at least thirty years to make money, but no more than ten years to study in college.
