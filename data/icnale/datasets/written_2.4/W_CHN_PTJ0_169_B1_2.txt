It is very popular part-time jobs to be family tutors, waiters and so on for them. There are many advantages for college students to take part-time jobs while they are at college. Firstly, part-time jobs could offer us good chances to make money to pay for everything we want, even for our education and shopping. Besides, it is not surprising that part-time jobs help us become more independent of our family. Last but not least, we are able to relieve our family financial burden. What is more, we can develop our social skills and gain experience which may be of great importance to our future career through part-time jobs. What is the most important thing is that taking part-time jobs can open our eyes and make our college life more colorful. From my perspective, as a college student we should keep a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. Although taking part-time jobs bring us many benefits, we must realize studying is our first task so that we should pay more attention to it.
