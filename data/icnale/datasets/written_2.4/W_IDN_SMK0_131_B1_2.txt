Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. i agree if all restaurant should be completely banned for smoking. Besides it if the restaurant not application for example in the pub discotheque it impossible for application this rule so in the conclusion it better the pub give smoking area in this area so not missing human right for active smoking and not give suffer a loss for passive smoking because effect for passive smoking it more dangerous than active smoking However individuals who smoke should realize that smoking in public places can be a source of great inconvenience to people who are around. Hence it is imperative that they should refrain from smoking in places where others are present. It is the only way to deal with passive smoking in an effective manner. Parents who smoke at home should be aware of the consequences that their action can have on their children, and so should not smoke in front of them. In conclusion, my opinion is smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country and all the public places too.
