Many parents want their students to be more responsible. Many students want to have more freedom. One way for both groups to have a winning solution is for the college students to have a part-time job, so I think it is a good thing for college students to have a part-time job. The students, for their part, demonstrate to their parents that they are responsible and ready enough to have a part-time job and to function effectively in the business world. The parents will see that their children are becoming responsible and be willing to give them more leeway to do as they please. They do not have to be so controlling of the children because the children are showing them that they have what it takes to make decisions for themselves. Next, many students need to make money. College is very expensive, and so many of them have to find a part-time job so that they can pay to go to school. It is not so hard to find a part-time job in college, because in every college town, there are many businesses that are very used to the college town environment, in which many college students work. They are usually very understanding of the need for flexibility in a college employee's schedule.
