For me, It's upon a situation for a college student. If the student is well enough and if family can support for the study, therefore it is not important to have a part time job because the part time job or a working student cannot budget their time fully, reasons of overtime, tiredness, mentally absent and etc. For example, for a student like us we have eight hours of studying and we allotted time for making the assignment, project and etc. We take the two – four (2-4hrs. ) in our twenty four hours in daily lives and we still have to work to earn money, let say for five-six hours(5-6hrs. ) then we are tired to that and probably there's a chance of failing grades. If we are born lucky enough or that the money is well enough in our lives, therefore it is very important to have it to finish the study and to find a better job or the best job because better is not enough for me. Students that a have part time job is a well independent because it is not for themselves to continue study, their goals is to help their family. It is very important for them or for us the money and the time to finish study. For those students who take a part time job for their luxury needs, it is also a good and bad. The good is there are not depend to their parents to bought what they want because they have a money to buy and they earn money, and they know how to budget it. For the bad side the they work for their selves and have a bad habits like drinking liquor, addicted in computer games and many more.
