It is important for collage student to have a part time job because part-time work could give student a new experience in working before they get into the society. Working part-time also helps student to understand the toughness of earning money. Contemporary we see student been a couch potatoes during their vacation so why not taking a new challenge and working with your body and your brain to have some contributions to your community? Despite you will be mature, you can also make a lots of new friends. And making friends is one of the principle for building of relation basis through out your life. You could try out different kind of jobs but choose the job that is relevant to what you are studying in because later on in life perhaps, your occupation is somehow going to be related with the degree you get also it's a discipline for oneself before getting to the company. For me myself, I like to work during the holidays, first it could earn money, secondly "working experience". We are facing economical pressures now a days, so helping family earning money could increase the revenue. However normally ill kept my wages for myself for buying things that I longed for, so I don't have to request money from parents and this is another additional benefit.
