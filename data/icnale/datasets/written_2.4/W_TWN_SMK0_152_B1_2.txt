Although I really hate second-hand smoke, I still don't think that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. The following is my reasons. First, I think they have the right to smoke. However, we also need to protect the right who don't like second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think restaurants should prepare a smoking zone. Maybe some restaurants can treat smokers only. Second, our country has a ban that smokers can't smoke in public space, but it doesn't work out. Smokers smoke while walking, because they probably can be fined when they stand at one place smoking. It makes the smell of smoke spread widely. The method in this statement can't solve the second-hand smoke problem effectively. Third, making the cigarettes' prices higher is the best way to avoid second-hand smoke. However, the manufacturers of cigarettes are not happy to see that. Maybe they will use their power to make government not increase the prices. I think this is why our government don't use the most effective way. It is also a reason that smokers still can get cigarettes easily from convenient stores, therefore, smokers still smoke, the ban in our country cannot make any threat toward them. In conclusion, I can't agree with this statement because it doesn't work.
