I don't agree that it is really. There are many arguments for and against but really, they are the same tired old stories that have been going around for years and have no relevance or little relevance to the individual except when they espouse that this topic, is subjective to the student's needs and not what the experts think they need to do. If I am a millionaire doing a degree for whatever reasons that I may have, why the hell would I need to get a job at the local pub washing dishes or cleaning floors? It's a crock that armchair experts like to sprout off about, like they are sharing some divine wisdom with the world. If a kid comes from a poorer area or family and manages to make it into college or university, then it only stands to reason that the kid may be a prime candidate for needing and getting a job. Nothing wrong with that and good on them for making things happen in their lives even if it means a bit of sacrifice and doing it tough for a while. There you have it, two separate scenarios where the student either needs to work or they don't so if the student needs to get a job then yes, it is important to have a part-time job at college. If the millionaire doesn't need to get a job then no, it isn't important to have a job. Nothing complicated about the topic really, like I said, it's subjective and maybe important or unimportant.
