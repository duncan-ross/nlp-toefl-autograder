I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In the beginning, everybody knows that smoking is a bad habit which will harm the health of body, so, there are many rules that not allow people smoke in public area. But as we can see, there are still many people cannot help to smoke, no matter in public area or not, whatever. Sometimes I think that is because when there are people smoking in restaurant, no one would jump out to stop them not to do so. I think if the rule could be made more strictly, even completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, maybe people who like to smoke would be forced to change their minds, and also their smoking habit. Also, restaurants are usually in a closed area, that is, if there are people smoking, the air in restaurants would be become awful very quickly. However, I think that would be a very difficult rule to be bring out successfully because there are too many restaurants, and, it would be also a tough work to define all the restaurants, or it is just also the "vendor". Those are why I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
