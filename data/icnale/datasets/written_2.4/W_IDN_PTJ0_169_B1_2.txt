Being highly educated is very important for university students. It is because, when they work later, a good GPA is the first criteria for having a job. Nowadays, many university students fail their study because they have too many activities outside. It can be because of joining too many committees or holding a part time job. That is why university students should not hold a part time job. First of all, holding a part time job makes university students unable to concentrate on their study. It is because, they still have another works after the lectures. They suppose to be working the assignments at home and studying instead of holding a part time job. After they work, they will feel tired and cannot do their homework seriously. Furthermore, they cannot work properly since their ability and experience is not enough. University students still do not have enough experience. For instance, when they have to serve the customer, they still do not know what to do or what to say if sudden problem comes. The last but not least, holding a part time job makes the students become money oriented. They will focus more on their job rather than the study. Moreover, they will not use their money wisely, since they still get pocket money from the students. Then, the result, they waste their money for something bad, such as drugs. In conclusion, students main task is studying. Part time job will only make them unable to concentrate on their study, become money oriented and loosing a lot of time. Therefore, a university student should not hold a part time job.
