Smoking see everywhere now people smoke happily but those around upset it but no where to go and can't tell to stop. In restaurants must allow smoking it toxic and chemical harm people smell it. The government promote the campaign stop smoking, people break the rules must pay money and if do it again go to jail. But a few people follow the campaign. Still see people smoke in public they don't care when look at their faces they look at my face back and don't are still keep smoking. Bad person and want to knock him. In the restaurants owners also smoking with customers so customers smoking don't take serious with banning. If people care smoking in restaurants can disappear and no one do smoking. In restaurants people must eat and take family to the restaurants to listen to music and enjoys menus but smoking can kill people. Someone easy to sick and smell the smoke then go to hospital. Who pay for it, no one. Because they don't have responsibility like a unkind man. Love to hurt themselves and people. Want to see people respect the campaign and don't do it please. Poor people get sick without know before it is a sin.
