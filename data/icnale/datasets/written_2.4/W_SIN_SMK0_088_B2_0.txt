I agree with the statement. Smoking should be not just completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smoking should be totally banned. Banning smoking from all restaurants can be the one of the first steps to achieving total smoking ban. The most obvious reason for the ban is that smoking is a bane to society. It has no benefits other than providing temporary relieve from stress. It causes air pollution, harms the smoker and people around the smoker, and also land pollution when cigarette butts are thrown around the ground. Restaurants are a place to eat and socialise. Smoking in restaurants will destroy the ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant, disallowing people to eat and socialise in peace. Who would enjoy eating in a smoky environment where you are choking for clean air? From this we can see that smoking creates a lot of negative externalities, affecting others negatively. We have seen past attempts to reduce smoking, like the high taxes on cigarette packs, but it is obviously not working. The best solution is to ban smoking completely. Although it is hard to just suddenly remove smoking from society due to addiction, it can be done gradually, by banning smoking in various locations and increasing the number of these locations until a country-wide smoking ban is achieved.
