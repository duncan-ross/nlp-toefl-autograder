For me part time job is a job that half of your time is spending or using to work in a company. Some of the people having this because they need to earn more money for personal purposes. I know the people who are most have this is the people who are ages from 24 above. In the statement, having a part time job is important for a college students, for me it depends in the situation. It is important to a college students to have the part time job because they have a lack of needs. One example of these is their education. They are working so that they can enter in school and finish his or her studies. For example, I have a friend who is a first year college student. She is studying in Lyceum of the Philippines University in General Trias, Cavite. And took up a course of Industrial Engineering. She is working in the company of their family friend. She was assign in the computer, she will be the one who type and print some documents. Her schedule in school is in the evening and she is working in the morning until lunch time. Her work starts at 7am until 12nn while her classes starts at 4pm to 9pm. I ask her why it is important to have a part time job. She said that it is important because this is the only way for her to continue her studies and to provide her personal needs.
