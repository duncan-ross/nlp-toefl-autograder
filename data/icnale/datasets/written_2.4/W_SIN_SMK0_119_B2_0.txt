Singapore seems to be on track in its plans to prohibit smoking in all public places except for designated areas. In 2006, the authorities had put in place a ban on smoking in all restaurants except for 20% of their outdoor dining areas. However, while extending the ban to prohibit smoking in restaurants entirely brings benefits to society, it could also put several groups of people at a disadvantage. Noting the harmful side effects to second-hand smokers, most would concur with such a decision. This is especially true for non-smokers who sometimes dine in the proximity of smokers in al fresco areas. It is impossible to prevent smoke from getting onto their clothes and hair as well as into their respiratory tracts. Imposing a complete ban would assuage these worries. However, extending the ban to all restaurants could cripple businesses, especially restaurant-bars. It is not uncommon for groups of people to smoke while having a few drinks as alcohol and cigarettes are well-known social propellers. Imposing such a ban would mean that these restaurants might lose a huge portion of their night business, and could translate into lower profits or even losses. Moreover, even though one of the intentions behind such a restriction was to emphasize that smoking is socially unacceptable, many feel that this ban would not encourage smokers to quit, but only annoy them. Drawing a clear line between two groups of people, smokers and non-smokers, could cause feelings of resentment and might result in the latter feeling that their rights have been suppressed. All in all, while acknowledging that smoking is indeed harmful, I feel that the optimal decision is not to ban smoking entirely in restaurants, but to grant smokers some space and encourage them to quit through other means.
