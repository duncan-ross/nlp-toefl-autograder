I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I believe that helping to pay for their education, at least in part, helps students cultivate a sense of responsibility and to appreciate the opportunity to receive an education. It also helps to prepare students for the world that they will be entering after graduation. If they already have some working experience prior to graduation, students will be prepared for the challenges they will face in the working world. Working part-time while in college has also helped many students understand the purpose of their studies. They come to realize that an education will help them avoid a lifetime of low-paid, unchallenging jobs. If their part-time job is in the same field in which they are studying, for example, if a nursing student is able to work part-time in a hospital, they will gain a deeper understanding of their future field. Overall, I believe that focusing their energies on a part-time job is a better alternative for students then using those same hours in nonproductive activities, and that they will find themselves one step ahead, if not more, by building themselves educationally and economically at the same time.
