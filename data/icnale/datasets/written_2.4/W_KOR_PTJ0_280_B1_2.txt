There are several reasons why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I think doing part-time job is a great opportunity for students to experience the society in advance. Through this experience they can learn by mistakes which in society are not actually accepted. They can enjoy this activity without the heavy burden of being scolded by the boss and they can experience different kinds of things through this. Secondly, they can search for their carriers. Actually, after graduating college and getting a job, it's difficult to change. However, from the experience of part-time job, a college student can search for the most suitable job they think it's appropriate for them. By doing this, they would not regret after being an adult. Another reason why part-time job is important is because students can learn to be responsible. They have their own responsibility and they will struggle to do it no matter what happen. By doing so, they learn to be independent and not just being mommy's son or daughter all the times. They realized that in this world there are things that they have to do and solve by themselves and I consider part-time job to be the right choice. Finally, students learn the notion of money. These days, many students are not aware of the importance to manage the money. If these people are given the opportunity to work, it will change. It is likely that they realize that money is something precious and it's the result of hardworking.
