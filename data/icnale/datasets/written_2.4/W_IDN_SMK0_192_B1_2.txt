I agree that smoking must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants is a public place, there are many people there from kids to old people. It is also a place for eating, not for smoking. We do not know who are smokers there. Smoking is very dangerous for health, especially for passive smokers, three times more dangerous than active smokers. Smoke from active smoker contains dirtier ingredients than original smoke from the cigarette. It may cause cough, bronchitis, asthma, etc. So it is not fair to the passive smokers. But, prevent someone from smoking is not fair too, because smoking already become habit to active smoker. Some active smokers prefer smoking than eating. The owner of restaurants can make a smoking room. So, active smokers can smoke in that place and did not pity another people around them. I read from many media that passive smokers is really dangerous rather than active smokers. Somehow, passive smokers can get a mucus in their lungs. And it can be detected by x - ray general check up. So, better we need to protect ourself and priority other people health by not smoking everywhere or if not, the active smokers need to smoke in smoking rooms.
