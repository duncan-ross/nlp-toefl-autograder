Many students are wondering whether they should get part time jobs or not because there are different opinions about it. The reason of some students is they need to sustain their needs, because some of them maybe are not rich to buy all their needs in school. But some of them are self-supporting, because sometimes there are parents who are not enough their income just to support their children's on their need, that is why we students decided to find a job just to lessen our parent's obligations, and also to manage financial difficulties. Besides, students can earn money by themselves, and this partly relieves their parents economic burden. Having part-time jobs mean having a chance of making friends with many people, who may help them out of difficulties. I do believe that their experiences in part time jobs can help them after their bachelor's degree and I believe that great benefits, which part-time job provides. Working students are those persons who are most likely to succeed for my own opinion. That is because at a very young age they already take the responsibility of working while studying. Moreover, the sense of responsibility and perseverance that were inculcated in their minds as early as students.
