Smoking is one of the activities that loved by the ones who like it, and hated by the ones who dislike it. For some people, smoking can relieve stress, especially when they smelling the smoke. Also, they feel like uncomfortable if they don't smoke for a long time. But, on the other side, smoking can be really annoying since the smoke polluted the surrounding air. This is why, most government banned smoking on some public places, like restaurant. And yes, I agree with this. There are some reasons why I agree with that. The first thing, the smoke can make other people feel uncomfortable. Why this is, I have already explained before. Also, inhaling smoke from smokers, known as passive smokers, is far more dangerous than if you smoke actively. Second, for the smokers itself, smoking can be dangerous for their health, as you've already knew. It can be from damaged lungs to the worst, death. Since the past, the disadvantages of smoking have already wide-spreading all around the world and the Internet. For conclusion, I strongly agree with statement that smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It makes other people feel uncomfortable and not good for health too.
