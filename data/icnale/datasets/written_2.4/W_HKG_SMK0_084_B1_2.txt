Should smoking be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? People have their freedom to choose whether smoke or not, but people also have their right to say no to breathing in cigarette smoke. In my opinion, smoking will not only damage one's respiratory and circulatory system and lead to some fatal disease such as lung cancer, it also causes harm to the surrounding and the people around. In order to protect both smokers and non-smokers, smoking at any places should be banned. Also, banning smoking can also benefit to the environment. In addition, apart from the health problems, there is another reason to ban smoking especially at all restaurants in the country. People go to the restaurants for eating, so their mouth should be occupied by food. Hence, they should have no spaces for cigarettes. Since the people in restaurants choose to eat or drink, there becomes no vacancy for smoking, so smoking should be banned. All in all, smoking causes even much more problems. Therefore, smoking at restaurants should be banned. To conclude, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
