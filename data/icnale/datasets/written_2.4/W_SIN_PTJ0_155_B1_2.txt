College is a time before one goes out to work. It is also a time between youth and adulthood. Often, this would mean a time that one is exploring one's identity as well as learning to be independent. As a result, in college, it is not uncommon to find someone taking up a part time job. Why then is it important for someone to take on a part time job? Firstly, it trains up independence. Without a part time job, it would be reasonable to assume that one would be still living off the allowance given by one's parents. At this age, students are often around the age of 21 which constitutes adulthood in most societies. With adulthood come the expectations of being more mature and being able to provide for oneself. However, college is also a time when people are generally busy and training up to take on a better future job. It would be reasonable to assume that if a part time job takes up too much time, then one should not take it up as it would be not beneficial if one gets a lower grade and subsequently a lower paying job in future. Yet at the same time it is important to realize that most students take on at least a part time job taking tuition and seem to be able to cope well with it. With some level of time management, it is very possible for one to sacrifice some free time to go about the part time job and remain independent.
