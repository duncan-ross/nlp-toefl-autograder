I would certainly disagree with the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As a student, we should still concentrate on our study. Doing a part time job will surely influence our study, which is against the purpose of us attending the college. It takes us much time working thus reduces our time for studying. Besides, part-time job can cause other troubles to you. When you make any small mistakes like dropping a plate accidently, you get scolded; when you meet with some tough customers who never seem to appreciate you service, you get frustrated. What's more, as students, we are not so sophisticated as the adults in society and thus we are likely to be cheated without awareness. There are many cases when college students go to find some lurable jobs and are eventually cheated of money or, worse still, violated by others. Last but not least, college is where our view towards life is forming. We can not make sure that we will not be influenced by all kinds of people we meet. Some would regret for the rest of their life if they form negetive attitude of life or a synical mind. All in all, it it really not a good choice for students to try a part-time job. Study, instead, is more recommended.
