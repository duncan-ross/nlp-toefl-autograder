We cannot get a job if we are in middle or high school, so it is first time for getting a job when we enter into university, although it is a part-time job. To get a job means that we can involve social interaction, and it is very important for college students to know society. In Korea, there is no opportunity to know society when we are in middle or high school because Korea educational situation force students to only study hard. Their ultimate aim is to enter good university, so most of them do not know about people and world. They can know many things related to subjects, but they cannot know the real tings related to society. However, if we go university and start part-time job, we must learn many things about the world because someday, we must work in society after we graduate. In this situation, part-time job can give you a lot of advantages. First, the part-time job can support you indirect experience of your future job. Through part-time job, we can draw your future job in your mind. And also, we can earn money, so it is help our parents. Therefore, I agree part-time job of college students.
