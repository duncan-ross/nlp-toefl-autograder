We don't have the same problem with this in Australia that some other countries have experienced. The government just introduced immediate bans in several places and that was that. Oh there were a few feeble protests and a couple of television ads. But these didn't really come to much and I believe that this is because people are far more educated and aware about the dangers of smoking these days and they know that, like it or not, that is the way it is and that is the way it will stay. It really is for the best and I agree with any similar bans being implemented in Japan or anywhere else. There is no justification for smoking in restaurants which, when smokers light up, releases dangerous toxins into the air for anybody to breathe and puts everybody at high risk. I strongly urge Japan to take the plunge and introduce restaurant smoking bans as soon as possible. There maybe some backlash because Japan does have a large population and many of them are smokers but the government needs to stand firm with their decision. Eventually, people will come to accept the decision and the ban and just move on with their lives.
