I don't know whether are not smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan because I have to admit that I don't know much about that country or its culture and therefore I feel that my opinion is not well informed enough to be taken seriously. However, when it comes to smoking in public places in general, I feel that it is better to lean towards the side of banning it. This is because smoking has wide area affects that are not contained only to the individual who are smoking. Alcohol and some drugs have over the years gone through various states of prohibition and usage, and I think that the main difference between these and tobacco comes down to the effects upon the masses. This is to say that when an individual chooses to abuse alcohol, they are really only hurting themselves (as long as they are not driving). However, a person who smokes releases harmful chemicals into the immediate vicinity and is therefore endangering the lives of people around them. Clearly, this second case is much different from the first, and people should deal with these subjects accordingly. I feel that the frequency of smoking has declined somewhat since I was a child and I think this reflects an increasing awareness of the harmful effects of smoking. One day, this knowledge will be widespread enough that smoking will be banned at all restaurants everywhere.
