Smoking Is not good, It can produce smoke and smoke is bad for smokers and people around smokers. But I don't fully accept to have completely ban smoking at all restaurants in the country, I think just have smoking zone in restaurants and have a good ventilator in that zone is enough. It wouldn't good for restaurant, If have completely ban smoking at restaurant because If smokers need to smoke when eating but restaurant has ban smoking, smokers would go back home, so restaurants would lost benefits. If restaurant allows smoking but doesn't have smoking zone, It would vary bad for restaurants and customers because smoke would take customers can't stand its smell then they wouldn't eat at that restaurant again, so restaurants would lost a lot of benefits. In addition to this, smoke from smoking is bad for everybody's health. So the best way to solve smoke from smoking in restaurants is setting up smoking zone in restaurants and have a good ventilator in that room. This way should take a lot of money at first but it is worth to do it, because it is fair for everybody either smokers, restaurants and other customers that don't smoke.
