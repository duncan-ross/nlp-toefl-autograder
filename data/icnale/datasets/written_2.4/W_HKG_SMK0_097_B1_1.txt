I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are some reasons. First of all, smokers smoke at restaurants is a kind of selfish behavior as restaurants are public place where contain many non-smokers. If smokers smoke at restaurants, the non-smokers will breathe in the secondhand smoke unwillingly. Actually, the secondhand smoke contains a complex mixture of different kinds of chemicals such as carcinogens. It may cause many fatal diseases to them such as lung cancer, nasal sinus cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, etc. It seems that it is very unfair to the non-smokers. Secondly, smokers smoke at restaurants will contaminate the environment. It is because tobaccos smoke is a kind of air contaminants which will cause the environment being contaminated. If the environment is not good, how can people tolerate to have meal at these restaurants? What will the consumers do then? I think that they may not have meal at those restaurants anymore if they have choices which may cause the restaurants losing important income from those non-smokers. As smoking causes lots of problems to human beings and also the environment, hence, I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
