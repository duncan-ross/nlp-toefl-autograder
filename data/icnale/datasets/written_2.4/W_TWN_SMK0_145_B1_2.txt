I really agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Maybe the smokers will think that it is unfair, but the place is public, we should respect all people in the place. As for me, I really hate the smell of that, and the smell makes me feel uncomfortable. When I talk to people that is smoking, I can hardly listen to his or her words. I will still cough and cough. And in the moment, I really want to escape or go far away from them, to get to a place that has fresh air and I will feel better after that. Also, being with people that is smoking will make us have that ugly smell. We have to take a bath to eliminate that kind of smell. Second, smoking is very bad for our health. Not only the smoker, also the people that suck the smell from the smoker to our nose. We are all sufferer! Although the effect will not be quickly seen on our body, when we are getting older than older, our body will get worse and worse. Last but not least, just quit smoking from know on! Although you feel happy when the moment you smoking, after that you will feel worse. Maybe when we are in lots of pressure, we can do something we like to do. For example, swimming, playing basketball, surfing the net... etc. They will help us relax and feel better.
