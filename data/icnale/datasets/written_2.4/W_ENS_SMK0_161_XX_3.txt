Banning smoking in restaurants and prohibiting smoking in all public spaces is long overdue in Japan. While they have imposed some bans, they have yet to take the vital step of including all public areas. I am certain that if a survey were to be contacted that around 4 out every six people would agree that smoking in restaurants should be banned. I smoke and even I don't like smoking and eating and I would never think of inflicting my cigarette fumes on to others and always look for a designated smoking area. I believe that out of such a survey, other smokers, like me, would also agree. I don't think that it is because all smokers don't care about others, I know that I do, but I choose to smoke for myself and I choose not cause discomfort to others because of my choices. There are many smokers who don't care and that is why I believe that governments should step in and lay the law down rather than wait. The longer that governments hesitate to act, the more people that will suffer and there is enough and has been enough of that already. People elect governments to govern and that is what they should do, govern prudently but firmly.
