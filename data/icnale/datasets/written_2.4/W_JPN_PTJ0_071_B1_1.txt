I agree with that statement. College student will go out into the world after several years. Some people are already working although we are same old. We have been supported for many people since we are a baby. Until elementary school we have done most of things as other people said. In junior high school we had experience many thing in club activity and committee activity and so. We were concerned with a little older people. And if you are a leader, you have to get the club together and listen all of the member's thinking. Before we go to high school, we should think your future. If you want to go to college, you should go to high school to study. If you want to be a nurse and a cook and an artist and a something expert, you should go to the school to become a expert. In high school, we experience a strict relationship with older and younger. So we develop as a person. Before we go to college, we should think about your future seriously. We think what you want to do in the future by myself. When we become a college student, we should decide many thing by myself. We should know about our society. If we have a part-time job and get money, we might change the way of thinking about money and so. And you have a chance that we relate people who are quite older than me. So we experience a lot of things when we have a part-time job. So I agree with the statement"It is important for college students to have a part-time job".
