For a great variety of reasons, it is very important for college students to hold a part-time job while they complete their degrees. First, a part-time job can teach them how to be responsible, and they can also learn to work is just one small piece of a larger organization. Too many American youths do not seem to have any sense of punctuality and seem to come and go as they please. This is not such a big deal in high school or in their private lives, but when it comes time to find a fulltime job after graduation, it is very important to be punctual and be on time especially in meetings and other situations where other people are depending upon you to be there. Next, it has become apparent to me since my daughter was born that young kids and especially teenagers do not really understand the value of money or the meaning of a hard day of work. When they want something, they simply ask their parents for money, and most parents do not know how to say no. This leads to spoiled kids who will have a very difficult time adapting to the business world. Therefore, for these reasons and many more, having a part-time job can provide many benefits to the average college student.
