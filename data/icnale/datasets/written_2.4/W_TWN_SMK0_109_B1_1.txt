The damage of smoking cigarette have been confirmed over half century. Smoking cigarette causes the diseases including the lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The passive smoking, someone breath other's tobacco fume in public area even he or she does not smoking, is another risk that has negative influence on people's health; furthermore, the passive smoking's damage on pregnant and children is more harmful than on normal adult. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people claim that the restaurants should build an area that allows smoking. In my opinion, I against this idea since it will cause two side effects. First, the smoking area leads to the air pollution among the whole restaurant. The Department of Health (DOH) sets a serious regulation of smoking area in order to avoid passive smoking, but rare restaurants reach this standard because of the equipments and high cost. Next, the children will imitate smoking as a result of adult's behavior that smoking in the restaurant. Once the children imitate this wrong behavior, it would be difficult to remove the addict of smoking and to decrease the amount of smokers. All in all, the smoking brings a lot of disadvantages, thus, I agree that smoking should be completely forbidden at all the restaurants in the country.
