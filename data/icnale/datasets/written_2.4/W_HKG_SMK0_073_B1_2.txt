Smoking was long been a serious topic in the world for many years. Non-smokers hate smoking because it generates a bad smell and makes people feel very uncomfortable. Restaurants are places for people to eat but not smoke, I strongly feel that smoking in restaurants should be banned in any way. To begin, smoking bring a heavy damage to both smokers and non-smokers. Smoking cause serious diseases like lung cancer was proved scientifically in recent years, it affect the health of people. Eating in restaurants is enjoyable, while it creates a bad image for those non-smokers from going to restaurants. Secondly, allowing smoking also has a negative impact to the restaurants. As the number of smokers are far less than the number of non-smokers, smoking in restaurants actually discourage the non-smoking from eat in restaurants. Furthermore, it is not always true that smokers will not go to the restaurants once when smoking is banned because it is not necessary for those smokers smoke in the eating place. The negative impacts for allowing smoking in the restaurants are obvious, but these are unfounded in banning smoking in the restaurants. As a conclude, the government should start moving in order to provide a better eating environment to our citizens.
