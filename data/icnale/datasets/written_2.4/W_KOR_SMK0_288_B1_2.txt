Being On a Different Footing! A few years ago, I saw an article about banning smoking at all the restaurants. Some people agreed with the opinion, but others didn't. This argument could be a controversial issue. It was really interesting to me. In my opinion, banning smoking at all the restaurants is really helpful for majors. Here are some reasons why I think like this. First at all, there are a lot of people including both smokers and nonsmokers in restaurants. Smokers may think that smoking is one of their rights for their happiness. However, it could be a so selfish thought, because when nonsmokers smell tobacco smoke, the feeling is much more terrible than smokers think. Moreover, the fact that smoking is never healthy not only for smokers but also for nonsmokers. There is no one who wants to be in a bad state of health. Also, restaurant is a place to eat food. If someone smokes in the restaurant, other people in the place would lose their appetites. This issue is often dealt with in some debates. We can find the solution if try to being on a different footing. Smokers can smoke outside, but nonsmokers cannot stop breathing inside.
