I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking brings with it many harmful carcinogenic affects, among other health issues, not only for the smokers themselves, but also to those around them, otherwise known as second-hand smokers. I feel that smoking is a very inconsiderate activity, especially in public places, as smokers tend to smoke wherever they please. However, others may be averse to smoke and laws that ban smoking in a public place like restaurants would help to protect the interests of those who do not smoke. Smoking in a confined place like restaurants intensifies the negative effects that second-hand smoke can bring, because if the restaurant is air-conditioned, the air within the establishment is actually recycled and may not be purified. This way, the harmful chemicals from the smoke are retained in the air in the restaurant. Second-hand smoke has been proven to be even more harmful than first-hand smoke after it has been taken in and released by the body. Hence, the retention of the second-hand smoke in restaurants would be even more harmful as the chemicals are not only retained, but also accumulated over time. If nothing is done to remove the chemicals from the air or to remove the stale air from the restaurant, future patrons may be aversely affected by the chemicals, though they may not even smell the smoke. Hence I feel that smoking should be banned in restaurants to protect the public good, as in Singapore, where smoking is banned in enclosed, air-conditioned spaces. Smokers should smoke only in specific, delineated areas.
