Restricting smoking at all restaurants is controversial, since although non-smokers may think this is a good idea, smokers naturally may not. It may also be seen as an interference with people's freedom. Different cultures may have varying attitudes as to whether business or governments have the right to ban smoking in all restaurants. Such bans may be beneficial by reducing the costs to society of smoking such as litter and health care. But it is going to reduce tax revenue and discourage the group such as cigarette companies. But banning smoking in the restaurant may not be a good idea. Because smokers may feel uncomfortable. Also passive smoking can cause objection to get freedom for smoking. In addition, smoking may bring some benefits to society, for example, in tax revenue and about the pleasure of smokers. And there is no reason why the disadvantages of allowing smoking don't outweigh the advantage. As a smoker I believe that restricting smoking in all restaurants is not a good idea. Because it can cause the problem bans limit smoker freedom. It challenges to the right which is protected by the constitution. That is why I don't support smoking ban at all restaurants strongly.
