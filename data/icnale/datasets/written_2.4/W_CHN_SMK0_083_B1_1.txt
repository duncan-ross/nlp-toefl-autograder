Nowadays, smokers are everywhere. We can find these people who seem always have cigarettes in their hands at street, in the shop, or even sometimes on the buses. Around China, most people prefer to talk business or chat with others at restaurants, and some of them, especially males, like to smoke when they are on their conversation. But smoking is indeed not a good habit, and it should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is harmful to smoker's health. Lots of serious diseases would be caused as a result of the bad habit, such as lung cancer. Secondly, smoking at restaurants does make a very bad effect on other customers. Not only does the terrible smell make others feel disgusting, but also the bad smoke may be detrimental to the customers. Thirdly, smokers always make the restaurants very dirty. Other customers may not want to have their dinner in such a terrible environment. Finally, as we know from some news, a great fire may be just caused by a little butt. In China, several restaurants have some places just for the smokers, but in my opinion, for the customers' security, restaurants still should completely forbid smoking.
