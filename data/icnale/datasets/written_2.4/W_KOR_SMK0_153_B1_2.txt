When I saw the topic, it is reasonable that smoking should be perfectly banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some (not all) people feel unpleasant about smoking. So do me. They have right to have an enjoyable meal. But, because of the smokers, the people are not being supposed to be disqualified by them. I have an unfavorable experience about this happen. As I went to the Chinese restaurant with my friends, we had the thinking about the luxurious atmosphere, and nice tasty foods. So we were very delighted. At that time, many guests came into the restaurant. Until then the guests did not have to worry about, we felt good. But the moment one of the guests was starting smoking. Then the other guests began smoking after him. Since then, the inside of the room became the fog and the smell of smoke. It was hard to breathe for us because the smoke blocked, and eyes were hurting, too. From then on all of my friends as well as the restaurant began to be offended by the smokers. So, in the end all the more impatient people protested them. The situation was resolved but everyone enjoyed delicious food and deprived of rights became unintentionally. So, I agree to be prohibited from smoking in restaurants.
