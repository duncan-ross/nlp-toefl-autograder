The part-time job is a common experience amongst college students. College students should be allowed to have various hands-on experiences But I find that one job doesn't provide enough variety. Therefore, it is important to have experience in a variety of through part-time job. Those experiences will be a great future asset when we graduated from university. However, various experiences are not easy to do. Requires much time and effort. I was worked part-time in a department 2 months ago. This part-time job is helpful my dream. Because part-time job and my dream is associated. My experience will be helpful my dream. But you should not focus only on part-time in college. Whatever the proper balance is important. The study also must be so hard. The important thing didn't take part-time jobs that do not require Unnecessary if a part-time job wasting time and didn't hard study. Also someone works part-time to pay for the school expenses. But Part-time job that can help is this working holiday. I'll learn some survival English and get a part-time job if I am lucky. I should do that also participate in a working holiday. For these reasons I agree part-time job during college.
