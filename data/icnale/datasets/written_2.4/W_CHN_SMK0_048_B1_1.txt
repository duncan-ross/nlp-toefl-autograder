I'm totally agree with this statement. I'm a non-smoker. In my opinion, I think smoking in the restaurant should be banned. Firstly, smoking in public does harm to the whole world. It is known to all that smoking causes lots of problems. For example, many diseases, fire disasters and so on. In recent years, the death-rate of lung cancer and heart disease are getting higher and higher. Then, restaurants are public place; each customer has the right to enjoy their time. However, smokers' smoke will pollute the clean air and let other people breathe in harmful gases. So everyone in public should be aware of other people's feelings, don't let your actions cause harm to others. In the end, I would like to say that many countries have taken similar measures, and have gotten well consequent. Now, in our country, more and more people come to realize the risk that second hand smokers will face, so our government should pay attention to this serious situation, in the meantime, take effective measures to solve this problem. This not only protects the residents' personal rights, but also builds a harmonious social atmosphere. It is good for every side. Generally speaking, I am strongly support this idea, and hope it can come true.
