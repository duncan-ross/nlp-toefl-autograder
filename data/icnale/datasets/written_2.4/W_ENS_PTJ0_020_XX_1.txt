Having a part-time job in college is absolutely an excellent idea for the majority of college students. Some students have very difficult majors which will require them to be more committed with their time in their focus but many others including myself can easily arrange our time to balance both the requirements of a part-time job and the requirements of attending school. For example, I work as a cashier at the campus convenience store, and the best part of this job is that when there are no customers we can study as much as we want to. In addition, I have made many new friends by working here at the convenience store. Many people say that students already have a job: their job is to go to school and get good grades. But I also think that there are some things that simply cannot be learned purely by studying in a classroom environment. For example, no matter how much studying you do you can never learn how hard it is to make money and once you have job you can learn this. What's more, having a part-time job looks great on your resume and can help you to find another part time job if you should need to do so.
