ALL OF US ARE CREATED BY GOD WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS IN LIVES. WE NEVER KNOW IF IT IS DESTINED TO YOU OR NOT BUT THE THING IS WE GET LEARNINGS FROM OUR EXPERIENCES EVENTHOUGH IT IS GOOD OR BAD. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO HAVE A PART-TIME JOB, I AGREE, WHY? BECAUSE MANY OF US WANT TO HAVE COMPETITIVE AND STANDARD SCHOOLS BUT OUR PARENTS CANNOT AFFORD IT, WE AS HUMAN BEING WE MUST THINK PRACTICALLY IF WE CAN GET BENEFIT FOR THAT REASONS OF HAVING NO MONEY IN STUDYING IN THESE SCHOOL. I THINK THAT HAVING PART- TIME JOB CAN TRAIN NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR TEENAGERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THEIR STUDIES BY THEIR PARENTS HOW TO EARN MONEY AND LET THEM KNOW THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY THING TO MAKE. WE IMPROVE OUR INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THIS THE IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE IN HAVING PART-TIME JOB, BECAUSE WE LEARN HOW TO EXPRESS OUR FEELINGS TO OUR FRIENDS AND BY THIS THEY CAN HELP YOU IN SOLVING YOUR PROBLEMS. THEY SAY THAT IT IS BAD FOR THE COLLEGE STUDENTS TO HAVE PART- TIME JOB BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE OUR DOING IN SCHOOL BUT FOR ME IT IS NOT HINDRANCE IN MAKING IN TO YOUR CLASS IT IS ONLY HOW TO USE AND MANAGING YOUR TIME PROPERLY, IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT CAN HELP YOUR FUTURE BECOMES BETTER AND YOU WILL NOT SHOCK IN THE EXPENSES OF WHAT OUR PARENTS EXPERIENCED TODAY.
