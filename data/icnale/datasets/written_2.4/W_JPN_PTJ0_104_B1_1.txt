To conclude, I agree with the statement : It is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons that I think. First, it is necessary for college students to earn by ourselves. We grew up using our parents' money. But we will learn it is difficult that lead a life only by ourselves by working hard and earning money. And we can realize that we must thank our parents for bringing up us. Second, college students can establish human relations we can't have only in the college through part-time job. In work, there are various people we can't meet in the college. I mean 'various' for different age or different career. We can learn the way to establish human relations with such people and importance of cooperating with them. Finally, college students can prepare for getting out into the world through part-time job. We learn machinery and rule of society we can't learn only taking a college lecture. It is necessary for us not to fail when we get out into the world. It must help us in the future. I have one more thing I want to say : we must not neglect the study, duty as students. We have not to forget to learn as best we can what we can learn now in the college.
