There are a lot of students in college that have a part time job. I think the only reason why they engaged or undergo into a part time job is because of salary that they can get. It's money. One of the reasons is lack of financial support from their parents or maybe they want to help their parents and younger siblings. They find ways to pay their tuition fees and to survive in their everyday needs in life. They helping their parents instead of being a dependent one, they choose to be a matured one. In spite of benefits that a students that have a part time job, There is a disadvantages that a student may encounter of a having a work. It is DESTRUCTION in focus to study. students may also bother, confused, stress, tired and unfortunately sometimes the working student forget their health. Having a part time job while studying is depends to the person on how they obtain their objectives; manage their time and how they love their studies and work. This is only in my own opinion because having a part time job will develop the set of mind of a student, to be more competent, to have a harmonious relationship with other people such as interacting with your boss, co-workers and costumers and also in the community in a good manner. 227
