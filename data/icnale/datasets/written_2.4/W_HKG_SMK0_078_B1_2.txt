In several counties, smoking has been banned from almost all indoor or enclosed areas. The government has also increased cigarette tax to try to reduce the number of smokers. Cigarette boxes are also printed with repulsive pictures of the diseases caused by prolonged and excessive smoking. Though, these measures do not seem to reduce the number of smokers much, at least the government is trying its best. Some other countries have also considered such measures and implemented them. I myself am disgusted by smoking. Though there is a smoker in my household, that did not influence me to be a smoker now. Smoking does not bring any good to our health or anyone around us. Smoking in restaurants may upset other non-smokers who are having a decent meal. And since restaurants are usually enclosed and air-conditioned, the smoke gets circulated around the room and the whole place would stench of smoke. Passive smokers actually inhale twice as much chemical as smokers themselves. The restaurants would usually have people of all ages eating there, children and the elderly who are more prone to respiratory diseases, after prolong exposure to cigarette smoke would be likely to develop respiratory symptoms. Also, allowing smoking in restaurants would also degrade a restaurant's reputation as when there is smoking, there would be cigarette ashes and they would tend to disperse everywhere and we cannot rule out that the smoker would dispose the cigarette properly. I would strongly suggest smoking to be banned at all restaurants so that we could have a'smokeless' meal.
