At the risk of providing an extreme view, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The strongest argument for such a drastic measure is that of maintaining a certain level of hygiene and cleanliness at the eateries. Smoking should be banned for the same reason that pets are generally not allowed in eateries. Patrons who have paid to enjoy a good meal in a supposedly clean environment should not have to subject themselves to being enshrouded in smoke because of the inconsideration of others. From the perspective of an economist, this is termed as a "negative externality". Smokers may argue that it is their right to take a puff as paid customers. While they may not be wrong, I am of the opinion that there should be a balance between the degree of personal freedom allowed and the welfare of the general population. The need for this balancing act is the very reason why the country is governed by laws. The law seeks to protect the interest of the general population in the same way that the ban on smoking at all restaurants would protect the interest of the patrons in general. The detrimental effects that cigarette smoke has on the health of an individual are known and well-documented. It follows that exposure of the general population to excessive cigarette smoke should be avoided.
