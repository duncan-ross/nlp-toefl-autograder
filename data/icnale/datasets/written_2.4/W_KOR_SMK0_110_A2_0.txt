I think smoking in restaurant banned but no public place can smoke. Smoke cigar is his free and right. Nobody cannot judge the choice and right. Smoking is rude and damage to the other people. I agree this opinion. But If smoker does not use cigar in the public space. It could be admission. My friend also smoker. He is very like smoking. He never smoke in the public space. He knew that smoking damage to the othere person. So if he wants to smoke, he goes out and smokes. Many smoker perceive that problem about when burned cigar made many smell and not good at health chemistry partial. He tried to care that he does not want to damage to other people. Smoking in restaurant or public space is very dangerous. Smoke always with fire. So that fire can progress big fire and can kill many people. That is why I cannot agree admitting smoke in public space or restaurant. I always caution that cigar cause many fire and harmful chemistry essential. Maybe I think no one never use cigar. . . It will become happy world. That is very not good at to human's health. So I think that Smoking should be banned!
