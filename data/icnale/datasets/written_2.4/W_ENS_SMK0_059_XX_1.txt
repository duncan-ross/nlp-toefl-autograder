It is a very good idea to ban smoking at the restaurants in Japan. Smoking was banned at the restaurants in my state a while ago, and it has brought with it many good changes. For example, the food has become much more delicious at the restaurants because you do not have to smell cigarette smoke which interferes with the taste of the food. Next, a lot of my friends have decided to quit smoking since smoking was banned at the restaurants, and I am very happy that they finally found a motivation to give up this filthy habit. I think that is smoking was banned at all the restaurants in Japan, all of the same positive benefits that I am seeing would come there as well, and the Japanese would be very happy to see them. Also, I would venture to guess that restaurants staff has become much more healthy as a result of this ban because they are not forced to work in a condition that is harmful to their health. It is also illegal to force people to work in a condition that is harmful to their health, so banning smoking in restaurants is actually already kind of a part of the law.
