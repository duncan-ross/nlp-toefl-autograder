I definitely agree that smoking should be banned in all public areas, such as restaurants, malls, etc. It's because the smoke from the cigarettes can cause the inconvenience, bad smell, and health problems to the other people around the smokers. First of all, the smoking habit in public areas can cause the inconvenience for other people. The smoke from the cigarettes and which the smokers exhale can make other people feel horrible when they inhale it. Besides, it is not such a great thing to be exposed by the smoke from the smokers continuously. Secondly, the smoke also can cause bad smell in our body. The smell of the smoke usually sticks in our body, hair, and clothes. It is not a good thing to keep sniffing the smell of the smoke all day long because we cannot change our clothes or take a bath immediately. Especially, if we only become the victims of the smokers' bad habits. The third reason is because the smoke can cause health problems. The smoke from cigarettes contains a lot of dangerous chemical substance. It is even more dangerous to people who directly inhale it, or we can say them as passive smokers. Though they do not smoke at all, but they have more chances to have serious disease, such as lung cancer. Because of the three reasons above, I believe that smoking should be banned in public areas. It is because the smoke from cigarettes can cause the inconvenience, bad smell, and also health problems to the other people around the smokers.
