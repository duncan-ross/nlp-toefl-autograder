No. I do not support the stand that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Restaurant is a closed air-condition environment. It is a cozy place for family members, friends or couple and etc. to dine in comfortably enjoy the atmosphere and their food. Although it is not right to smoke inside, but at least the area outside the restaurant should be allowed. In clubs and bars, even though is air conditioned, but smoking is ironically not prohibited. Why? It is because friends, colleagues go there at night to relieve stress, to have fun and enjoy themselves. Same applies to restaurants, people go there to enjoy and fill their stomach. So I believe that closed air conditioned restaurants should also be allowed smoking. I have seen a lot of smokers went out far away to some open air environment to smoke as even the area outside the restaurant are not allowed to smoke. For restaurants which prohibited smoking may lose some customers as they would prefer to go to restaurants which allowed otherwise, as it is quite inconvenient to leave their food half eaten and go out to smoke. I personally do not smoke, but in my view i feel that smokers should also have their own space in the restaurant to smoke. 217
