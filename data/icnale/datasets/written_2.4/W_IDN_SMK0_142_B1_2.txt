I hate smokers. Smokers and its smoke are horrible. I do have my own reasons as the foundation from my opinion. I am a biotechnology student, and I know what is inside the cigarette itself. I am reluctant to imagine that smoke is entering my body and interrupt the whole system inside because cigarette smoke contains four thousand chemical compounds, 200 of them are poisonous which 43 of of them triggers cancer. There are two categories of secondhand smoke. First, the mainstream smoke, the smoke that comes out from the mouth of the smoker, after previously smoked and passed through the lungs of the smoker. Second, the sidestream smoke, the smoke that rises from the base of the cigarette before it is runs out. The toxic chemicals from the smoke of this type are more harmful than mainstream smoke. The sidestream smoke contains carbon monoxide five times greater than the mainstream smoke. Carbon monoxide itself, as we know, is a toxic gas that is quite effective in crippling the ability of blood to absorb oxygen. That's just one of many effects that can be caused by cigarette smoke for active and passive smokers. Imagine if you as non-smokers are affected because of irresponsible people who smoke selfishly. That is why smokers should be banned completely not only at the restaurant, but also in other public places.
