Pollution is one of the greatest problems faced throughout the world. It is everywhere, and one of its causes is smoking. Some of the readers might shake their heads in disagreement but whether you like it or not, it is true. Aside from being a contributor in pollution, smoking also damages the health, not just the people who are smoking but the people inhaling the secondhand smoke as well. The issue being tackled in this essay is not just about smoking itself, but smoking in restaurants. Almost everybody knows this fact yet, many are still smoking. Worst, smokers are found to be doing their habits in places that are supposed to be for people's comfort and satisfaction: in restaurants. Even if there is a sign hanging or posted in a wall saying No Smoking, smokers are unstoppable. They kept on smoking even if the persons surrounding them cannot enjoy the food because of the frequent coughing due to smoke. Because of this, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. No one can stop ALL the smokers throughout the country, but smokers should at least be prohibited in certain areas such as restaurants. Restaurants are the types of places where a family get together and enjoy, where couples celebrate special occasions and where persons simply eat. No one wants cigarette smoke present around them while they were eating. Nobody wants to be distracted while eating just to cough because of the smoke from a careless smoker. Every person has rights, which include the right to breathe in fresh air. If not all the time, smoking should at least be prohibited in places where people eat. Persons who are not smoking should not suffer for the things they have no control over. To the Authorities, the decision are yours, but kindly consider that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants at least throughout the country,
