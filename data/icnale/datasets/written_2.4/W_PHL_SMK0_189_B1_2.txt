Agno is a famous eating place in our university. It is the place where you can find the most affordable yet delicious food around the university. As you pass by the street where it is located, you would immediately smell the aroma of the mixed variety of food they offer. If not of the hint of smoke, I would immensely enjoy the beautiful scent of mouth-watering food. The longer I stayed at the area, the more I could feel my nose slowly get clogged with polluted gas. Every time I think of this, I remember the image of the lungs of a non-smoker living in the city that can be seen from The Myth of the Human Body Museum. Those lungs were unhealthy, dirty and gray with black spots. The only pair of clean, white lungs were from the person who has lived his or her entire life in the mountain. I realized that even though I have never tried smoking, there is a huge possibility that my lungs look like that. I have lived in the city for 16 years now and I encounter all sorts of pollution I know of every single day of my life and to me, smoking is the most evident. Of course, I am not in favor of this but I can't help but deal with it quietly and just let the day pass without doing an action against it. This problem is hard to stop or avoid but it is still possible to do something to prevent this. Banning smoking in all restaurants in the country might be a good step towards smoke prevention. Who wants to be around disturbing gases while eating, anyway? Eating in a healthier environment assures us a good step towards lessening the danger to innocent people's health.
