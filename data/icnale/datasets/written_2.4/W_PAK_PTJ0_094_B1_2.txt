In my opinion it is not important for a college student to have a job. Because his or her study is strongly effected to do it. But if a person is poor and he wished to study more than it is a better idea for him or his family because to do it he continued his or her study and he fulfill his or her. All over needs and he sported his family. Though job he get a large money and bought books for her self and he or she called a independent person. In our country mostly families are belong to middle class and in the age of inflation it is not possible a students to continue his or her study with out having a job. Some students are only that person who they supported his family. In other words job save the young generation from many bad habits and keep them a good person of a society. A job less student adopt many bad things. He may be get into a bad company. He may be he made a bad person for all society. But due to job he will be busy and work for the society.
