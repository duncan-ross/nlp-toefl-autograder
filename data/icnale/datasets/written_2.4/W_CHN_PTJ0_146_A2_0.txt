 Now, quite a lot of college students take an active part in part-time jobs. They think part-time job can have many advantages. On the one hand, they are eager to develop their ability and broaden their horizon in face of the pressure of employment. One the other hand, with a large portion of their living expense and tuition covered by their parents, they want to earn some money to decrease the pressure their parents are shouldering on. In addition, if they take part-time job, they can get many experiences from them. However, there are still many college students who have never take a part-time job. They are unwilling to challenge themselves and reluctant to do it. They think their first task is to study rather than a part-time job. What's more, some students say that they are busy. I believe that the so-called busy is just an excuse. Personally speaking, a part-time job is quite necessary for a college student. College is no longer like the high school. It's a place whose purpose is to cultivate independent and intelligent person. So if you have more time after you classroom time, try to take your chance to find a good part-time job. You will have many benefits.
