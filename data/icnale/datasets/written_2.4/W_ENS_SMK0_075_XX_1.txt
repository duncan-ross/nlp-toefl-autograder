I agree with the given statement that smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan. I have seen how harmful smoking can be for everyone who does it, and since smoking has already been banned at the restaurants in my state, I have seen a lot of improvement in the cleanliness and sanitation of public places in general. This goes to show that there will be a direct improvement in the health of the citizens if smoking is banned in restaurants, and if the smoking is banned in other places as well, they will be an even bigger improvement in the health of the average population. Also, many of the restaurants in my area have reported that they have increased their income by banning smoking in the restaurants as they are able to attract a wider base of clients. Even though they have some clients who are smokers that were unhappy to see that smoking was banned, everyone can agree to enjoy the food in the restaurant and save smoking for other locations. If smokers can adapt this easily to a simple ban on smoking in restaurants, I think it is not such a big deal and Japan should go ahead and ban smoking in their restaurants if they feel they need to.
