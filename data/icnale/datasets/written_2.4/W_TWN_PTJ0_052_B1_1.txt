I agree with the point that college students should have a part-time job. Being a college student means that you are going to become an adult. Not just the meaning of the word, it also means that you have much more responsibilities on your own. Having a part-time job could let you learn to control your money. It also could let you decline your consuming on your life, because you realize how hard it is to earn that money. Second, having a part-time job also can let you learn how to manager your time efficiently. Because besides studying, relaxing, entertaining... etc, you also have a part-time job. It is very important to learn how to work and get good grades at the same time. I think the most important thing is that after graduating from college, you are going to be a fresh-man in the society. Having a part-time job is a kind of life experience. When you doing your part-time job, you may have to communicate with your customers, workmates, boss... you will learn a lot of social skills from it. When you graduate, you also ready to step into the society already. Different from other people who never have a part-time job in their student life, you have more chances to show your experiences and could face much more complicate challenges. Sum of all these reasons, having a part-time job are not just can help your parent to pay your fee, but also could teach you a lot.
