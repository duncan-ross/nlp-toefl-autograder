I agree that it should ban smoking in public areas since smoking is dangerous for health such as cancer, bad smell breath, and easily tired. What is more if you smoke several cigarettes per day, you will be faster died. Smoking not only devastates your healthy but also disturbs others surrounded. It, moreover, is more dangerous for others' health that is near you while smoking than yours. It is importance to save rights for people who is not smoke because they do not smoke but they have to have a lung cancer or other diseases concerning respiration system. I think it is not fair for them so we should find methods to solve this problem. Banning smoking is one way to clear the problem. Now we have rules about prohibited smoking in the public although smokers do not care it. I, for example, have ever seen a man, who is a teacher, smoking in my school despite of prohibited smoking sign in front of him. If he were worker, could not read, I had not had blamed him but he is teacher. I felt very disappointed. From this situation I think government must have absolute punishments for them. Another good way that I see is cabinet provides smoking rooms in the several public place such as airport, hotel, and etc.
