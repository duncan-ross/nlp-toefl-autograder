From many campaigns of the government to decrease smoking, it is clear that smoking is not accepted by the majority because there is no one could step out and persuade everyone to smoke. In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned especially in restaurants. Personally, I can say that I am one person who does hate smoking because it could drive me mad and annoyed every single time I smell it. Imagine the restaurant's atmosphere, there should be quiet, neat, smell good, and beautiful, but these senses will be kicked away if the smell of smoking comes. So, I cannot see any point of allowance to smoke in restaurants. People come to restaurants in order to eat, listen to beautiful music, and have a good time with family, friends, or lover, not to smell the smoking. In my opinion, those restaurant who allow smoking would discredit themselves because people would consider that restaurant dirty and low quality. Nevertheless, smoking would not only destroy your health, but either other people around you. Moreover, smoking would make your image negative especially women, because social often hope that women should be modest. So, smoking should be banned at all in restaurants because it could not bring anyone's happiness.
