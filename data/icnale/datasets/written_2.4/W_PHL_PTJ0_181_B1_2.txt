What are part time jobs? Part time jobs are when a person work only a few hours a week. This situation is often taken up by students. Those students manage to juggle their time between work and their studies. As a Lasallian, I think that part time jobs are important because it builds character and enriches a person's life experiences. I, myself, have never had a [art time job because I always felt that if I do I would be overwhelmed with all of the things I have to do. However, being in La Salle and meeting all these amazing people made me realize that you can achieve anything you put your mind to. I see people taking up double majors yet they still have the time to work in local businesses or serve their community. This really changed my view on the subject. This proves that nothing is impossible with the grace of God. These are the people I consider as well-rounded individuals. From their jobs they have learned how to be responsible, how to be committed and how to be dedicated to finishing their task. They have shown all of us that with proper time management you can achieve more than what you only think you can. Also, they have shown me that the lessons they learn from those real life job experiences help them to become better students and become better equipped to take on whichever job they chose once they graduate.
