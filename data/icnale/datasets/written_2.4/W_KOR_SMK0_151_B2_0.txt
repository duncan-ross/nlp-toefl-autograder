Are you smoker or not? I am not smoker, because it is totally not good for everything. First, smoking is not good for your health. A smoke cause many diseases like a lung cancer, stroke, and diabetes etc. more than non-smoker. Because cigarette has nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and others. In particular nicotine is a drag, bad affects the functioning of the heart and arteries. Second, smoking affects other people who are in the same place with you as well as the smoker. That is so disturbed to non-smokers. Especially, the smokers who smoking on the street blow cigarette smoke in non-smokers' face. I think that is one of the selfish and rude behaviors. Third, smoking is not good for your instinct of preservation of the species. Every creature form has an instinct to preserve its own kind. If you are smoker, it will be hard work and have a bad affect on your descendant. I mean your children who will be born. For these reasons, smoking is not good for your whole life. Sometimes, you want to smoke at once when you have a problem or follow your smoker friend, but please remember that do not addict to smoking. As I said, smoking produces all evil and no good.
