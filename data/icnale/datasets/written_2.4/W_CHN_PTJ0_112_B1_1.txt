 Having said goodbye to the stress of college entrance examination, the students who succeeded in being admitted to the colleges find them faced more changes and challenges. On one hand, we hold more freedom and motivation in learn. The fellows around us having the same interests and goals as us, the teachers who play the leader roles in their subjects, and the learning atmosphere that can't be more suitable, these entire make the college be a right place to study. Maybe the college students are the happiest learners. But on the other hand, is the college just a place to deal with the knowledge on the books? In other words, do college students spare no effort to enter the universities just for studying? The answer, of course, is No. It is universally believed that entering the college is the beginning of stepping into the society, where everything is much different from that is in schools. Actually, rather than just being a teacher, a guide to help students change themselves from students to social person should be the colleges' main role. And to be a part-time worker, I think, should be the first step. No one will deny that the society is full of complication and is so difficult for us to adjust ourselves to. Then the part-time job make it possible to become knowing about the society in advance and lead us to begin to prepare for all kinds of challenges in the future. After all, the schools teach us what to do but who will tell us how to do is the experience we gain in our practice. So why don't we start the process earlier and, as a result, make it easier?
