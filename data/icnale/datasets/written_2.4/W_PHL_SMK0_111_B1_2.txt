Smoking has been part of the human society since the ancient times. It started from dried leaves up to now's known cigarette. Most people become addicted to its aroma. Addiction is one of the society's hard-to-solve problems. So we should start limiting it to public places such as Restaurants. It is hard to force people to be off with it. It is like you killed part of their lifestyle. Based from what I observed from the people around me, they most likely to smoke after they eat. So I agree with banning of cigarette smoking in restaurants. It can be a great help of lessening the smokers. You not only ban it but also teach them lesson that it is not healthy to smoke in public where other people can be affected. Second hand smoke was known to be more dangerous than the first hand. In places like restaurants which are public places must think of their prohibition. If it is hard to stop some people from smoking then the only way we can help others is to restrict them on places they can smoke. In our country, Philippines, government is a little smooth on smoking rules. They only give small taxes on vices which is wrong. It's like they encouraging others to smoke too. Like to the restaurant managements, they should also do the same. They should have off limits to it too. I do agree on smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
