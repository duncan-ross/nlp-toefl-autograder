Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. There are people who have weak lungs or don't like to inhale smoke. Because there is other who smokes in those restaurants that they want to go to, they were forced to choose other restaurants that don't have smokers. Those other who eat in those restaurants won't be able to enjoy their food because of the bad smell coming from cigarettes. People go to restaurant so that they could enjoy their food but if there are smokers in restaurants they won't be able to enjoy it and instead end up having a bad experience while in it. I had read an article stating the dos and don'ts before and after eating. One of the don'ts is smoking. It state that if a person smokes after he/she eats, the food they ate won't be digested properly. That will cause sickness. So those people smoking inside these restaurants obviously, ate something or drank something and it could endanger their health. Smoking is not really illegal but it could cause sickness to the smoker and those around him. If these smokers keep on smoking inside restaurants, health-conscious people would eat somewhere else where it is safe. Smoking could result to lung cancer. I always advice those smokers that I know to stop what they are doing because it might be the cause of their deaths
