Nowadays more and more college students take a part-time job. About this, I think, it is a good phenomenon and it is important for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job can bring extra money to students and this can allow they to buy things they need and relief their parents' burden. And students will learn to treasure everything they have and they will love their parents more than before because they have experienced the pain of making money and they have been aware of the hardship of life.
