A rising and common concern amongst college students nowadays is getting employed into a good company, especially with the increase in competition and demand. They find themselves mostly under qualified for the job they aspire, and so they resort to part-time jobs. Part-time jobs, not only do they give students a background in the work environment or OJT (on-the-job training), but also consume only a small amount of their time, allowing them to still be able to focus on their academics. In my opinion, part-time jobs are not required, but highly recommended for any college student. The working experience comes in handy when it comes to entering a professional working atmosphere or a similar job. As an accounting student, I volunteered myself to get summer and part-time jobs at a real estate firm. Though my occupation may not necessarily align with my future aspirations, the learning experience I gain is extremely helpful. It has not only taught me how things are supposed to be inside an office, but also the flow of work, the sense of professionalism, and the dedication to work. Basing it mostly from subjective input, I do highly recommend and agree that college students have part-time jobs.
