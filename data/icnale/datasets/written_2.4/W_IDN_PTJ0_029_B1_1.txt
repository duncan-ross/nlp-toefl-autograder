If I have spare time, part-time job which I will choose is to become a kindergarten teacher. Due to become a kindergarten teacher is a fairly easy job but full of responsibilities. Also, I am very happy with small children. They're cute, adorable. When I teach, I will teach with great laughter but a serious and focus on what is taught. I will teach with sincerity. I will teach them to read, write, sing, draw. I will also accompany the play, help with her job if things are not understood. Besides, I also will always consult their parents on the development of their children. Besides, I also will always consult their parents on the development of their children. What about his children in school, how his behavior, character, and of course they also like what progress from day to day. And I think to be a kindergarten teacher is a noble job. Although only work part time, I was very happy to spend my time with the kids than no job and doing things that are not useful. I also told my friend who wants to become a kindergarten teacher and have the same hobby. So we can use our free time with work to become a kindergarten teacher and could get enough salary.
