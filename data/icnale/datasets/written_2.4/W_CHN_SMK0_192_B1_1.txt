As we all know that smoking does harm to our health. The topic 'Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country?' is so hot. In my opinion, the answer is yes. Obviously, smoking is bad for our health. Some smokers, however, like to smoke in public places, such as in the restaurant. When they are smoking in the restaurant, not only themselves, but also others will be infected. If smoking is allowed in the public places, the person who does not smoke will be infected and then they will be sick. At the same time, study shows that smoking does bigger harm to their health. This is unfair. On the other hand, smoking will pollute the air and the environment. You should know that smoking is dangerous. When you go to a restaurant, you will find that the table, table cloth and so on which are damaged by smoking. You can find holes in them. So you should understand the effects. We have a conscience by nature. So we cannot be selfish. Finally, it is a good idea to ban smoking in public places and in the restaurant because a ban can reduce conflicts and does less harm to human beings' health. At the same time, the environment we live in will be protected. Everyone can do it immediately.
