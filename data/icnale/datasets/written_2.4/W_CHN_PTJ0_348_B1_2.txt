There is a phenomenon that college students often take part-time jobs. In my opinion, it is advised and necessary for college students to do part-time jobs. First and foremost, everyone have to start to go to work sooner or later. By doing part-time jobs, we can learn how to deal with relationships among colleagues, how to handle tough tasks asked by the boss, how to keep good moods when meeting unfriendly customers. We are certain to grow up and know the society better through part-time jobs. In addition, many people think that studying is the only burden that students should bear. Doing part-time jobs will probably waste limited time and make scores drop down. I strongly disagree on this view. Sitting at a desk for several hours and keeping reading and writing can not guarantee high scores in every test. College students can walk out the classroom to breathe fresh air and have a relax during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can use the extra money they have earned, other than given by parents, to buy things and entertain happily with a sense of achievement. In a word, doing part-time jobs is really a good and necessary way for college students to study outside class and know the society better. Come on, try it know!
