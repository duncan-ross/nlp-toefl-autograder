For the majority of college students, a part-time job is an important part of the college experience. This is because they can meet a variety of new people with a variety of new opinions and ideas. Having a part-time job allows you to meet people you might never have met if you do not have one. For example, I work in the call center at the university, and a lot of the people I've met there are not from the United States. It is extremely interesting to talk to people who are not from the same country as you because they have a very different culture and a very different way of thinking. If I never had a part-time job like this, I would never have made these friends and I would not have had the opportunity to learn about all these different ways of thinking. The only problem is that sometimes I feel very stressed with school and work and I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I need to do. However, it is very nice to make a little bit of extra money for going out on the weekends and having a good time with your friends.
