Nowadays, more and more countries pass laws to ban people smoking in public areas. For example, France has forbidden people smoking in café a few years ago. The citizens who defy it will be punished and feed for a lot. This law received warm welcome by most French people. After that, some other countries followed this deed and passed some familiar laws to ban smoking. In my opinion, ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country is very necessary. Firstly, as everyone knows, smoking is bad for people's health. Smoke can do great harm to people's lungs and breath organs, and what's more, it can raise the rate of getting lung cancer. The smoker also does harm to his or her family members while smoking. So it's wise for people to abstain smoking in order to protect their health. Secondly, when people smoke in public areas, all people around him or her have to breathe the second-hand smoke, which is more harmful to their health than to the smoker himself by research. It's also very unrespectable to other people in public areas, especially in a restaurant where all people have meal. Imagine the situation that you have to smell the choke gas while eating, it's really disgusting, and you may feel that you are offended. So I think it's meaningful and necessary to make laws to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. This can not only produce harmony surroundings in restaurants but also protect people's health from being damaged.
