Part time job I want to! I do not part time job not yet. But If I will have chance, I must do part time job. Because that is really helpful me. I had done just serving assistant in institution. When I was 17 years old. It was very special memory. I had good relationships with teacher and many students. I handed out many paper and I checked their paper about question right or wrong. I learned many social relationships. As a result many teachers in institution liked me. They taught I seem like very dependence person. And my grade also good. During part time job, I was very interesting. Just interesting and not hard and not painful. But while midterm exam and final exam, I was so tired but I could patient. When I gave money of one month working, I really was happy. That money, I bought my bicycle and I gave money my parent. Especially I bought delicious food and new shoes and many things. Spending money was very fun. I felt I want to get more money. And I want to use them. And I quieted my first part time job, because I became a high school student third grade. SO I prepare entrance test. I concentrated in study.
