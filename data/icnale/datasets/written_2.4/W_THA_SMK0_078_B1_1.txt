Smoking In my opinion, I think the meaning of smoking is behavior that most people do but they don't know it be hateful. Everyone may be doubt, why I said that ? but be patient, I'll explain you. According to my opinion, I think smoking is nasty because smoking not only annoys yourself but also everyone around you ;moreover, It's disadvantage for your life but everyone's life because Toxins in cigarette can make an impact for smoker such as Nicotine can make you addicted to them, Tar contains many substances coalesce brown, it cause color stain on your finger and teeth. And Carbon monoxide can make you lack of oxygen and numb etc. According to many reasons that I said, I think smoking should be completely banned in everyplace that have a lot of people. because if you don't ban, it will make many disadvantage more for person who don't smoke. If you don't want to be a person that everyone don't want to approach, just try to follow this. First thing you shouldn't drink alcohol because it'll stimulate you and make you smoke again. Second thing drink water 6-8 glasses per day because water will eliminate nicotine in your health.
