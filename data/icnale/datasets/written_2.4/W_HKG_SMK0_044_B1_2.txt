Smoking is a habit of breathing the smoke of ignited tobacco in and out. It is now prohibited in many places according to the law. In my opinion, it should be completely banned at all restaurants. Firstly, smoking is bad to health. It is proved that smoking can cause heart disease as well as lung cancer and related diseases. This is true to both smoker and second hand smoker. Smoking at restaurants make the case even worse as the smoke emitted will transmit through air and may stay on the food that are going to be eaten by customers, affecting more and more people. To reduce the chance of developing such diseases, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Furthermore, the existence of smoking customers discourages other non-smoker to enter the restaurant and have a meal. Many people will not like sitting besides smokers as the smoke emitted is very irritating to non-smokers. Thus, the seats next to smoking customers are likely to be emptied and thus affecting the income as well as the reputation of the restaurant. To conclude, as smoking habit in restaurants can seriously affect other non-smoking customers, it is no doubt that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
