I think it's very important for college students to have a part-time job. College is a totally different stage from junior and senior, because college students have more time to arrange and have to take full responsibility for their jobs. If college students can have a part-time job during their students' life, they can have a contact with the society, know the need of the job and learn some work skills before they step into region of job. This experience may help them find their jobs more smoothly after graduation. For example, if I major in accounting, I would try to have a part-time job in account office. It could make me realize what the ability I should have, and I can use the chance to know the whole system of account office. Another reason for getting a part-time job in college's life is money. Many college students should go to other county for studying and their parents may not give them money. So they have to find methods to earn money. Some college students use their knowledge and skills to make money. There are many creative students design a website and manage it, and when the website start to get the highlight of people, they sell it to the big company and get abundant money. College students can arrange their time wisely, and I think having a part-time job is also important.
