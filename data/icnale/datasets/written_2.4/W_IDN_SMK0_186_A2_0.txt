I think smoking is prohibited in all restaurants in other countries because it can harm the health and even die but in Indonesia is still in Get legal not know since many restaurants in Indonesia and around the mall that still allow all people to smoke-free but actually in Indonesia was released laws on banning smoking in public and in public places Indonesia but most people ignored the law that is issued and is set by the government and all of that is because most all people in Indonesia have dependency with cigarettes and cigarettes are also in the one used by all the various groups of age in Indonesia so, the point in Indonesia masi can not force the existence of laws banning smoking freely everywhere and anywhere when the Indonesian government to give affirmation to the community in order to reduce him to smoking habit and in rehabilitation for addicts give cigarettes most likely the air we breathe could be more cool and we avoid the air pollution that could make the disease within us. I write about the conclusions of the above is that all people should be free from dependence on smoking because smoking can cause death and in Indonesia still not free from cigarettes so, say "STOP SMOKING.
