As a college student, we have more time which we can totally handle on our own than before. It is maybe the first time they live without their parent and have the own power of their own life. Some may want to get a part-time job to earn more money for luxury items or something else they want. To my perspective, it is great to get more life experience through the job. What's more. If students have their career experience when they are still young, they will be more skillful for the future time. And they will know how hard it is to earn life; it will be time to appreciate what they get from their parents. To the perspective of a corporation, they will get a more mature staff compared to who do not have any work experience. People who love work and strive during the working time will be fine. But for students, learning is what they should put on the first priority. If they just work all the time and abandon their study, it is like put the cart before the horse. No enterprise will hire a college student who did not finish his education. Students can only have a part-time job when they have free time.
