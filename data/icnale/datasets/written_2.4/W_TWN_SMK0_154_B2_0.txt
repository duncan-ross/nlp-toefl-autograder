Smoking should not completely be banned at all restaurants in the country due to the following reasons: Smokers should also be respected by non-smokers; they can smoke in a specified area without bothering others. Therefore, there should be certain restaurants that allow people smoking and restaurant themselves could decide if they want to welcome smokers. Even if the Taiwan government has banned all indoor-smoking since January 2009, there are still some indoor facilities that welcome smokers, such as karaokes and clubs. If smoking is banned at all restaurants in the country, some restaurant owners might still welcome smokers in order to be more competent. Banning smoking is not the best way to decrease the amount of the smokers. On one hand, an implanted policy cannot resolve the problem at a glance. Perfecting the education system by giving more life lessons instead of only the solid information and academic knowledge, people would have become more self-conscious of their health condition. On the other hand, restricting smokers from restaurants could possibly result in more people smoking on the streets. It might be a potential cause for air pollution. To sum up, smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country is because that there should be a better way to resolve the problems caused by smoking and that smokers are not equals to criminals.
