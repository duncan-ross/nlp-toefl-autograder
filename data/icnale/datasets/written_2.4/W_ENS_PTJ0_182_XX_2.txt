I disagree because it really would depend on what the part-time job was, whether the students needed the cash or whether the job was going to contribute in some meaningful way to the students' studies. This factors would then more accurately reflect the facts and whether or not it was important for students to have a part-time job while they were at college or not. If students had to have a job to just to live or pay college tuition, then it would be important for them. If the part-time job was industry specific and aligned with students' career choice, then it would be important for them. If however having a part-time job was simply to fulfil some misguided notions that students need it to build character, learn basic work skills, like money handling, time management and the like, then no! I don't believe that it is important for them because they could easily learn those skills during the course of their degree without needing to get a job to get them. For example, a simple search of the Internet will reveal hundreds of time management courses that are available for free. For that matter, the college library would more than like have this information on hand.
