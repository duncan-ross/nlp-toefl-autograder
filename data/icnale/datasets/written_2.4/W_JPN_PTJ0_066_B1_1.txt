I agree with the statement. I show first reason. I have a part time job now. My part time job is in privet school. I teach science to students. My students are junior high school students. I feel junior high school science is very easy. But, my students feel science is difficult. It is very interesting. I think about them very much for them to understand science easily. I think that it is a precious experience. This experience makes me better than now. And privet school part time job is presentation practice. Presentation will be very important for me in college and society. I show second reason. Part time job allows college students get money. I got money from parents since high school. It was 5000yen for a month. But, I get 20000yen for a month now. Getting money myself is very happy. And getting money myself teach me importance of money. But, I think that part time job has some bad sides. Part time job has studying time shorter. College students must study hard. I think that rate of part time job and study is very important. Conclusion I agree with part time job because it has more good points than bad points for college students.
