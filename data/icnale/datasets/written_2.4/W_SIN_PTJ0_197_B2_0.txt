The benefits of juggling work with studies are numerous. First benefit lies in improving one's time management and organisation. As most part-time jobs are time-consuming, students are forced to plan their timetable well in order to excel in both work and school. Second benefit is the gaining of independence from having a part-time job. Working for money gives the students a sense of satisfaction and freedom from being able to take care of themselves, without depending on their parents financially. This journey to adulthood strengthens them physically and mentally as well. Most part-time jobs are demanding and experiencing this harshness of the reality of the working world broadens the students' minds. Understanding how the ways of the bigger world work while they are still young is very beneficial for students to cope with future work. Physical work like waitressing tests on students' ability to think on their feet as well as the capability to handle the physical manual labour involved in the job. Some may argue that there is no point in entering the workforce at such a young age. They base this on the reason that students should focus on school while they are schooling as education is far more important than work at that stage. Their mind-sets are at fault here as they feel that education is the most important accreditation to one's portfolio in going far in life. In conclusion, I beg to differ and feel that having a part-time is important for college students.
