A part-time job is the activities that many people do for making money, it is not a main job. Today, there are many college students interested in doing a part-time job for making more money during studying. For example, teaching kids, selling goods, etc. I think a part-time job is very good and I agree with it. There are two main reasons for supporting my opinion about this. The first reason is some college students are not very rich so they should do a part-time job to help their parent. The second reason is, whoever does a part-time job, he/she will gain more experiences, which may help him/her to find a job when they finish studying college. But, I still don't agree totally. If some college students think whether they should do a part-time job or not, they must consider themselves if they could manage their life well enough, say, while they do part-time job, their studying result should not be too bad. The most important thing is how to divide the time of studying and the time of doing a part-time job. Therefore, a part-time job is a very good choice about making money and gaining more experiences while studying in college but they must think carefully whether they could do a part-time job or not. Maybe, they should consult their teachers or parents before deciding. Finally, the type of a part-time job is also very important, they might be very bored if they choose a wrong part-time job so they must think what type of part time job they like most and do it.
