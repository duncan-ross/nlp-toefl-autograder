For food, not only taste and decoration of food, but also smell of it are very important. When people smoke at restaurants, people cannot smell the food because the smell of cigarettes ruins the smell of food. It makes people lose their appetite and they will not be able to enjoy the food and atmosphere. Moreover, when the other customers come into restaurants which are filled with smoke and cigarette smell, not the smell of food, they will feel uncomfortable. Smoking at restaurants is unhealthy for non smokers who smell the cigarettes. According to some scientific researches, second hand smoke can cause diseases. There are not only smokers but also non smokers at restaurants. Since restaurants are public places, people should not harm anyone under the pretext of freedom. Some people claim that smoking in restaurants doesn't have to be banned and suggest making smokers' area. However, this idea would not make waiters and waitresses free from second hand cigarettes since they still have to serve food to customers in smoking area. All in all, smoking should be banned in all restaurants for the pleasure of dinning and for all people's health including smokers.
