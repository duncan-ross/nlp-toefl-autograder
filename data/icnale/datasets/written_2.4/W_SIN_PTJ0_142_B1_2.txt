Having a part-time job is definitely not important, albeit useful, for college students. College life is not quite like what it used to be in the past, when it marked a period of serious learning and fun. However, in today's context, college life appears to be a lot more hectic and less fun. Since most students hope to acquire a "good"job after graduating from college, it seems only prudent that they devote their attention solely to their studies and leave money matters to a later date. This way, they would (supposedly) be able to better focus on their studies and get the desired grades. Yet I opine that having a part-time job would be useful for college students. The things taught in school are ultimately ideas and theories. It is perhaps only in the working society that students would be able to really put their knowledge into good use. In addition, the working environment provides opportunities for them to learn things beyond what is taught in school. Cliche as this statement sounds, I believe it holds true, given that I am working part-time whilst attending college as I am writing this essay. Work also allows students to not think about school and academic matters all the time, and offers an avenue for both money-making and stress-relief (depending on the job, though).
