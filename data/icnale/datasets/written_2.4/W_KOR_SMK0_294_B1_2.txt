I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. first of all, smoking is very bad at our body. well, second-hand worse than smoking directly. because smoker snuffs smoke through filter. but others does not. by the way, smoking in the restaurants, another person is unwanted second-hand smoking. also, when inhale cigarette smoke during a meal, another people can take umbrage and appetite fail. and reek of tobacco can take umbrage. and cigarette ash can drop in food. then there are children in restaurants and pregnant women. cigarette is not good for their health fatally. if smoker smokes outside sacrificially, many people's complaint can get solved. Of cause, smoker's freedom is important. but if smoker considers others, it meets with good results. smoking section can be restaurants separately. but because restaurants is open space, cigarette smoke can be blown a nonsmoking section. Therefore, later, smoking section can be a chip in porridge. so, i think that smoking shuld be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. also, this rule can help to stop smoking. if so, the rule that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country gose for the effect of killing two birds whit one stone.
