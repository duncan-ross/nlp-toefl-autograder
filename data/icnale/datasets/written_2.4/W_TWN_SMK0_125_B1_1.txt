Cancer become the terrible killer recent years. Some patient died after discovering that he got sick in few months. And the lung cancer is also in the top ten of the dangerous disease. According to the research, the percentage of patient who got lung cancer is that second-hand smoking is easier than smoking people. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Those have the lung cancer by second-hand smoking is innocent. They are not smoke to pollute the environment and the air but get sick. And we are in the public space like restaurant and theater. People should respect others property. Everyone live in the same planet. It almost has a same air-condition in the restaurant. So there is one person smoke, it would cause other customer in the store smell the terrible second-hand smoking. I believe that most of people will follow the rule of the public place. It's polite to respect other people. But I still find out some people didn't care about the rule just smoke as his mind. If you try to stop him smoking, you might be blamed by the smoking person. To prevent meet this kind of selfish person, government should set a law to completely ban the action of smoking at the restaurant or public place.
