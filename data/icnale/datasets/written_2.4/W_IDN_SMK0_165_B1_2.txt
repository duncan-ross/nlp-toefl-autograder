I agree if smoking is totally banned in all restaurants in this country, I also agree if smoking is banned in all public places. Because cigarettes are toxic, poisonous to the smoker and people around him. In cigarettes contain of harmful substances such as nicotine, TAR, etc. These chemical substances can cause cancer, respiratory problems, impotence, etc. This is a disease that will suffer when smoking. More dangerous, active smokers inhale only 25% of these toxic substances while the passive smokers (people who inhale the cigarette smoke but not smokers) inhale the smoke exhaled breath of smokers activism and contain 75% of substances that poison. So people who around smokers who smoked more easily infected by diseases caused by smoking. It's means that smokers not only damaging himself but also to poison others. This is the evil cigarette, did not participate breathe but allowed to have negative impacts. For this reason I agree that in a public place should not be smoking. The smoker will only smoke spread poisonous to people occupy in the room he was, especially in the restaurant. All food will be injected toxins from cigarette smoke. So, the poison is not only enter through the respiratory system but also digestive system. Imagine how dangerous cigarette. Even cigarettes also contain opium that makes people can not get out of it easily. So that he will further poison the body of the smoker. Smoking is the right of every person but healthy also is the right of every person. For the two rights were not violated, then in every public place should be there is smoking room. So, smokers can still smoke without bothering others.
