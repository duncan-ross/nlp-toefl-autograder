I was very disappointed to see smoking banned recently in my city, and I think that there would be many disgruntled smokers just like myself if restaurants ban smoking in Japan to. The fact is that we have a right to smoke if we want to. I don't think that this gives us the right to smoke in front of other people though, so I think that we may have to find another solution to the issue. Many nonsmokers complain that separating a restaurant into a smoking and a nonsmoking section is not sufficient to prevent the smell of cigarette smoke from wafting throughout the entire restaurant, and perhaps a better solution would be to establish a better barrier between a smoking and nonsmoking areas or alternatively add some kind of a ventilation system which would clean the air and the nonsmoking section more quickly and more efficiently. I think that a large portion of any restaurants clientele base comes from people who are smokers, and people who are smokers tend to be more loyal to restaurants that treat them well. So, if restaurants do not want to lose some of their profits by excluding part of their client base, they should find a solution that allow smokers to enjoy themselves in the restaurants in addition to the nonsmokers.
