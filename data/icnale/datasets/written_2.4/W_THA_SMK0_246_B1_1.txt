In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. There are many disadvantages of smoking. There are three reasons that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First, smoking destroys the lung. Second, smoking makes you have bad looking. Finally, smoking affects the bad effect to others. First, smoking destroys the lung. There is a nicotin that is included in the cigarettes. If you smoke everyday, the nicotin can be collected into your body. It can destroy your lung. Moreover, you will be cancer. Second, smoking makes you have bad looking. For example, if you always smoke everyday, you will have bad looking. You will have dark lip. You will have bad smell. Your skin will become yellow skin. There are many effects from smoking that make you have bad looking. Finally, smoking affects the bad effect to others. For example, if you smoke in your home everyday, the bad effects will not affect to only you. The bad effects will affect to your lover person such as your father and mother, your lover, or your son. They can be cancer although they do not smoke. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking has a lot of disadvantages to the smoker and others.
