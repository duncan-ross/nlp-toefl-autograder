In my opinion, Smoking area of restaurants in the country must be completely banned. Restaurant is one of public places. Public place is not private space but space which Many people are using. Smoking Act like cigarette is harmful to someone in. For example, the health of babies to cigarette smoke is deadly. Also, cigarette smoke negatively affects pregnant women. These negative affect impacts on their general health problems, as well as cause of Death will bring extreme problems. Therefore, for this reason, Smoking in public places such as restaurants and should be Prohibited to all relevant. But in many nations, the law is unclear on the act of smoking in public places. Having clearly established the law, Penalties including fines system will be Strengthened. So, I want to say that strengthen the law governing corporal punishment And consequent damage to others that that is a way to reduce smoking behavior. After this process the posted, the effect will necessarily receive and people need to Worry about cigarette smoke will be reduced. Smoking should be completely banned at All the restaurants in the country. I agree strongly with the following statements. Smokers must conduct their own action and should be aware that it is critical for people Which is not smoke and the others to damage in all respects. At the moment, Change is the time to recognize the urgency of smokers.
