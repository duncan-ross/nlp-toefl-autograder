Close your eyes and imagine walking into a restaurant that reeks of smoke; how would the restaurant look like? Without sight, our sense of hearing and smell heighten. Eating, is not just to satisfy our stomach, but an enjoyment. People pay to eat in restaurants, to enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the services. During dining, before the food is placed in front of you, you already know what is to be expected as the waiter walks out with the mouth-watering plate of exquisiteness. The fragrance of the Rosemary roasted lamb soaked in expensive red wine would have done the job! Hence, it is important for all patrons to be able to soak in the moments with all their senses, and to do so, it would be necessary for smoking to be banned in all restaurants. It is widely known that smoking is detrimental to our health, especially to second-hand smokers, which in this case would be the non-smokers of the restaurant. However, for smoking to be banned in restaurants, it may be considered an outrageous move by many smokers. Some may argue, restaurants can simply separate smoking and non-smoking areas to meet the needs of both groups. However, even with the smoking area, it is impossible to contain air particles in an enclosed area. Eventually, smoke will travel from the smoking area to non-smoking area, making the set-up of non-smoking area obsolete. Hence, with smoking banned in restaurants, it will enable the patrons of the restaurant to enjoy the food thoroughly. Furthermore, this encourages smoking patrons to be able to taste the joy as well. Reports have shown that smoking dulls our sense of taste. Over long periods, smokers might be able to regain their sense of taste and start to appreciate food differently(with less smoking breaks and smoke)!
