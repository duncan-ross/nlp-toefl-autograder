In American, most of American teenager have a part-time job. They can study and work together. Thinking of the American teenager are if they want something, they will get it by self. In Thailand, The Thai teenager are different from American. Because of the Thai social is family. Parents take care their children and almost they live together so it's not important to go out and work. All above I talk about the different of thinking of the American and Thai teenager. Today, I'm studying in the University. Everyday I have to use much money to buy anything such as foods, books, appliances, etc. Moreover I have to pay for many activities. A part-time job is the way can help our parents to reduce using money. Somebody are doing it now because he or she doesn't have money enough. I think it's unneccessary for poor people to doing it. Maybe Everybody should do a part-time job if you can because It is good and use free time creatively. The example for do a part-time job is work in the restuarant such as McDonald, KFC, Sizzler, MK or use your talents to make money for example ; if you can sing you should go to contest, if you can draw and paint you can make money by your work. You can do it everything you think that can help you make money. A part-time job is the way to help you get money even it isn't much more, but it's enough if you have economical life.
