I think that smoking should be prohibited at the entire restaurant. There are many smokers in Japan. They are able to smoke at a restaurant for instance. Some restaurants don't separate smoker's tables from nonsmoker's table. When nonsmokers drop into the restaurant, they must choose enduring smoke of cigarette or stopping entering. When they choose enduring smoke of cigarette and smoke spread in the room, they must become bad feelings. At most of restaurants, smoker's tables are separated from nonsmoker's tables because smoking makes not only smoker's health but also nonsmoker's health bad condition. However nonsmokers can not help breathing smoke of cigarette in the restaurant where smoker smoke even if they are separated. Health of smokers gets wrong day by day if they go on smoking. And then breathing smoke of cigarette is worse effect to their health than smoking. In short, both smoking and breathing smoke of cigarette are unhealthy behaviors very much and they one of main causes of cancer of the lungs. Smoke of cigarette also makes their taste bad. Furthermore wallpapers of the restaurant become dirty by smoking and ash of cigarette makes unclean surroundings. Those are the reason I insist that smoking should be prohibited at the entire restaurant.
