I disagree because the student in the university not have free time or empty for to make a job on part-time. The student must to study very hard and did home work every day. Sometime I will go to shopping with my friends at the Central and BigC for buying about food, milk, goods, things and fruits, etc. Sometime I listen to music and see a movie at the theater; beside I will go to dancing with my friends at the night club. Sometime I must to examination. So I have to read are books more than to work a job on part-time, because everybody have a good grad after last the exam. Sometime I want to exercise in the park with my friends and play sport someday. In the future everyone have different to make a job; moreover, I want to make is a good job for my life. Sometime I want to live in my house with my family and I want to help my family about housework, for example, I can cook a meal, I can wash dishes, I can wash floor and I can make everything in my house. Sometime I fell boring or upset, so I will go to Internet cafe for playing a game online, listen to music and chat with my friends.
