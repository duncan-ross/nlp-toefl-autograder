I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. Firstly, we can know what society is by having a part-time job. When we have a job, we need to care about the manner, clothes, way of speaking and so on. If we know about them, they will help us in the future. Secondly, having a part-time job would give us an opportunity to think about the future. This is because there are various kinds of a part-time job. We can choose whichever we want to try. Some part-time jobs may be interesting for us but some may not. And we can know about ourselves. For example, what we like or not, what skill we have or not. Then we would think what we want to do after graduate a college. We also think what skill we should gain in order to prepare for the future. Lastly, we have to communicate with people who we've never met when we have a part-time job. So we don't have a lot of chances to communicate with new people. There are many people where we work and they are from other cities or schools. We would find many differences between us and them. In addition, we can learn how to communicate well with people and know the thing we don't know. Therefore I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
