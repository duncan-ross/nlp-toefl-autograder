Everybody knows how smoking can affect our life. But still, lots of people are still addicted to it. And if there will be a law about the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country I will 100 percent agree. It is one way of helping those chain smokers to stop their bad habits. It also helps other people who don't smoke in preventing their healthy lifestyle. Most people didn't understand how dangerous smoking is. They don't mind the odds of getting sick as a result of smoking. Although smoking is a very difficult habit to break, still it's your choice. It's your responsibility to choose whether or not you will continue to smoke. Banning smoking in public helps lessen the smokers in one country. By doing this, we are helping our mother earth in avoiding air pollution. Remember that quitting is probably the most important thing that you can do for yourself. Never forget that your life is at risk if you continue to smoke. Quitting smoking may be one of the difficult things you accomplish in your life, but remember, it may be the one thing that saves your life! So start living a healthy life now. Quit smoking before smoking quits you.
