In this modern age, prices of the basic commodities rise, and not all families belong to the middle-class and high class. In order for these people to earn enough for their tuitions and other basic necessities, students often apply for part-time jobs to increase the income that their family is earning. Applying for part-time jobs doesn't mean that you are degrading your own status in the society; it is just a matter of choice that you are making. It is important to those college students to have part-time jobs if the income of the family is not sufficient for them to have their other needs and wants. Students having part-time jobs are also given scholarships in some schools. Letting college students have part-time jobs is a way to make them realize earlier the hardships their parents must go through in order for their parents to give them the best life they can ever have. Letting students work for their own money is a good training for them so that they won't easily waste the money the money their parents are giving them. If the students are the one that are earning for their own, they will be reminded of their own parents who had worked hardly for them, and they would remember that money is not easily earned since one has to work hard for it in order to earn a big sum of money. One will only know the hardships others have gone through once he experiences it himself.
