I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that smoking is not good for health. It is one of the cause of lung cancer and many people die because of it. Every time you smoke a cigarette, you may harm other people's health too. Other people who breath in smoke may die because of lung cancer and other diseases. The second reason is smoking can be addictive. When you smoke a cigarette, you will want to smoke more and more. You may use all your money to buy cigarettes and have a financial problem. Another reason is that when you smoke cigarette or tobacco, other people will not want to be your friends. Everybody knows that smoking cause bad smell and other bad things. So, they not want to be with persons who smoke and avoid talking with them. The final reason is that smoking can cause bad smell in restaurants. All customer in restaurant will not enjoy their eating and will not come to that restaurant again. So an owner will get less money and have to close a restaurant. In conclusion, for these reasons, I believe that banning smoking is a good idea.
