Part-time job is a job that doing at free time. Many people have a part-time job to get more money. It is usually done by college student. At my college, Institute Technology of Surabaya (ITS), many college students have part time job. They get part time job if they have a lot of free time. But, they don't get it if they do not have a lot of free time. They usually take part-time job after their lesson done. There are many purpose college student take part time job for examples they take it to increase their money. They can use it to buy some books, to buy their daily need and to pay school fee. They take it not only to increase their money but also to train their soft skill. For example, if they get part time job at restaurant, they get ability to service much people. It is good for their soft skill. It will help them when they had work So, part time job is important for college student with have a lot of free times and have good control of time. But, if they do not have a lot free time I should not get the job because it spend times and decrease study's time for the college.
