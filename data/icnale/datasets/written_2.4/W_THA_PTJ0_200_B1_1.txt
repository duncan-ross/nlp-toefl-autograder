If you mention the word Part Time all have to think about work during free time after school for students or students who are interested is that it does not do every day. May be when all that students are free in the evening or on weekends. Then the thought of working with students with either the International Industry School or university is also encouraged because we learned of the work. Actually, they will know their time is appropriate and important to make ourselves known to model stand on your own. Par time job is related to self-tolerance training. It is about supplementary income. We will not be a burden on parents. Also, we help alleviate the burden on parents. It also allows us to experience many different views. To meet with people from work when doing Part Time is only one of benefits. But I think we should consider, need to measure how to work valuable. If students are not ready to work, they should wait until they are ready. For example, the first year student may need time to adopt themselves in school and school program or university that different from high school, so if they still can't manage, they may lose their study. Be ready when doing part time job and also respond for homework and all things from school so we will success.
