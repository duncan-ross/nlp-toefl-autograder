Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? It is necessary for me. There are two points support my thought: First, if I have a part-time job during my university life, I will acquire more experience than other students who doesn't have jobs. Second, having a part-time job is an efficient way to make lots of friends and expand our sights. Sitting in classrooms to study books vary far from working outdoors or in an office. To my appointment, it is no challenging to contact with books every day because they are non-living. That is to say, they can't talk to you, argue with you, and even reject you. But people are different. They will blame you or let you very embarrassed in front of everybody. So, to avoid such as conditions occur, we ought to accumulate our working experience in teenagers. But, I not only do not pay attention to my school work, but also regard my school work as a foundation. Because, having enough knowledge from textbooks is a basic of success. Although my parents don't want me to earn money now, I still desire to acquire some working experience to prepare my future. Regardless of I longed to attain experience at the moment, I will still do my best at my education to full of knowledge.
