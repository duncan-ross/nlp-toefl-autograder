Should smoking be completly banned at all restaurants in the country? In my view, smoking is not suitable at all restaurants because it certainly harms others' health, therefore it should be a good act. However, it will become hardship for restaurants as smokers are not allowed to smoke at meal. And it will just cause chaos to restaurants. First, smokers are not a minority group of people and they are from all walks of life. Banning will definitely affects the income of restaurants. Especially for those other than fast food resturant, smokers as customers will stay for a peroid of time. Smoking is an addictive action and it is always hard for some smokers to bare the addiction for that peroid. Therefore, they will choose alternative ways to have meals. For example, to have take-away meal or to find some restaurants which do not obey the rule and allow smoking illegally. Then, to execute this law is extremely difficult. As prohibitting smoking at the restaurant is to decrease the competitiveness among others. So, some of them will illegally allow smoking.
