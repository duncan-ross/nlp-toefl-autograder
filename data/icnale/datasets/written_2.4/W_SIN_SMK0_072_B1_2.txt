Yes, I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking destroys the ambience of the restaurant and the dining experience. Imagine trying to enjoy a meal in a high-class and polished restaurant with cigarette smoke wafting all around. The image just does not match! Firstly the smell of cigarette smoke is unpleasant and this interferes with the diners' tasting of the food. As we all know, the senses of smell and taste are strongly linked together and one does not work as well without the other. This is the reason why we cannot seem to enjoy our food as much when our nose is blocked as we cannot smell the food. Similarly, since the smell of smoke overpowers the smell of food, diners will be unable to enjoy their food as much. Thus, if restaurants want to enhance the dining experience for the diners, they should ban smoking in their restaurants. Secondly, smoking is bad for health. Notwithstanding the personal health detriments that smoking brings, it also adversely affects the health of other people. This is not fair to the non-smokers because they did not choose to breathe in second-hand smoke. Allowing smoking also does not align with the image of health-conscious and organic restaurants. Thus, for the better health of the diners, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
