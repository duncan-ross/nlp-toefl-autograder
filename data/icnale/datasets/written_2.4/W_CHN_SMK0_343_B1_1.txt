I strongly agree with the topic that smocking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people would like to have a smock after meals, and we can always find many people smocking in the restaurant. As we all know, smocking does great harm to our health and second-hand smock is even danger. As reported, second-hand smock has the same possibility to cause cancer and children are sensitive to it. So when someone smocks in public places such as a restaurant, what great harm he will do to people around him. In the meantime, it is also not a good idea to sit in a fog when we have a meal. And the smell of second-hand smock is not very good which we would never want to smell during a meal. So I always feel upset when my father smocks after meals, which does harm to everyone's health and broke the atmosphere. Above all, I suggest that smocking should be completely banned in most public places as soon as possible in the country, especially at the restaurants. And the smokers themselves should also consciously keep the smock out of restaurants, and make a better atmosphere for diners.
