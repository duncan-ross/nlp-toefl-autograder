Do you agree with the following statement? 1. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this opinion. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have following reasons. First, college students should know the real world. I think to have a part-time job is to study the real world. It is important for college students to know the real world. It becomes useful for them when they decide a job formally. If we experience many kind of part-time jobs, for example, cram school's teacher, waiter, cook, and so on, we can decide what kind of job we really like. If we don't have a part-time job when we are a college student, and if we get a job without knowing what the real world is like, perhaps we can not continue the job long. Next, college students should learn worth of money. Until you graduated from high school, you could rely on our parents. But once we entranced to university, we should not rely on our parents as we were high school students. We should buy the text book, our clothing or something with money that we earn by ourselves. Then, we can learn how precious money is. Of course, college students go to university to study. So, studying at university is most important thing. But I think studying outside university is also important. From these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
