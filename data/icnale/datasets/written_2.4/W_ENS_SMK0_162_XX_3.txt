Well, they have introduced similar bans in Australia but we have yet to see any dramatic reductions in smoker's deaths or related diseases. For general health and safety though, I agree that Japan should ban smoking in restaurants. Just because we have not seen anything dramatic in Australia yet, does not mean that it will not improve the situation. I think that it is a good decision for everyone to have worldwide bans on restaurant smoking, even for people who smoke. One less cigarette has got to be a good thing in my book and it so much more pleasant to enjoy dinner without feeling the need to order an oxygen mask every time I go to a restaurant. I think that it would be a great decision on Japan's part if they did especially since Japan is known to have a large population of heavy smokers. I think that it is important that governments act decisively and not diddle around like schoolchildren out on their first date. Good for Japan if they do I think and even though it might take a bit of effort to police the law, it would be well worth it if even one life was saved.
