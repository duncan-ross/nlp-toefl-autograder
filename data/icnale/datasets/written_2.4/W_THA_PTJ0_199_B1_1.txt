I think that it is not really important because college students have to do a lot of homework, review the things which the teacher have taught at the classroom. Not only college students must care or spend time for, but must they also take the responsible for their daily life such as washing cloth, cooking for food, and etc. In the other hands, If college students have a part-time job, it will be the severe obstacle for student. Since student will take their time on the job. Working late at night, college students will not have the energy for their study in the morning. The result is the poor grade that is caused from their part-time job. Moreover this problem can impact to their parents too. Because when their get a bad grade, it mean that their learning is poor, the people who expect on them (parents) will be upset and disappoint with their learning. Finally, for college students life, the first thing that they ought to focus on seriously is studying that can develop their life and be the opportunity for them to get a better job in the future after they had graduate from the university.
