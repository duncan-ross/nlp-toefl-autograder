I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. With the following ideas, I would like to briefly elaborate the reasons why. There are three main reasons. First, part-time job give students a good chance to interact with people outside the campus. It is a progress of learning to adapt the future lifestyle, as well as taking the step of knowing the society. The progress of learning plays an essential part in each of our life, especially for college students who are going to graduate and start joining the company and work. Second, getting a part-time job help students establish their way of living in the society. It is a process for one to learn to take more responsibility as becoming a more mature adult. By taking more responsibility, I mean taking more considerations before making decisions or taking actions, as well as being responsible for any out coming results. Last but not least, having a part time job can be seen as a series of trainings. Through the trainings, students develop their own and appropriate way to deal with all sorts of issues. Also, by building up their own way of managing all kinds of tasks, students get a clearer idea about how to face the problems in the future. Besides studying, having a part time job in college can surely give students a picture of how the work, or how the world they are going to enter look like. Additionally, part-time job is a great opportunity for us to take what we have learned in to practical. It is important to have knowledge, but it is also important to know how to use the knowledge. Thus, I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
