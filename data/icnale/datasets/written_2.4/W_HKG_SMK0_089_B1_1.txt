Banning smoking in restaurants has been a buzz word in the territory nowadays. It stirred a lot of discussions around the city. It is well known that smoking affects our health since we were still in kindergarten. The smoke from the cigarette is very irritating. Such smoke can be so annoying for people who sit next to the smoker, and this completely influences the whole atmosphere in the restaurant. Some smokers may suggest that restaurants can be divided into smoking area and non-smoking area so that those non-smokers could not be irritated or annoyed by the smoke. In indoor restaurants, however, the circulating system is running through the whole restaurant no matter the smoking or non-smoking area. At the end of the world, the problem is still there. The health of staff who works all day in such a closed area is greatly affected, not to mention the other customers or even the smokers themselves. From the point of view of the smokers, banning smoking in all restaurants may not be a nightmare for them. Actually this may be a golden chance for them to try to quit smoking, and this is one of the main reasons why the authority keeps on promoting this new policy. Encouraging people to quit not just benefit to the smoker himself, but also bring benefit to his family. According to a survey, smoke can be seriously affecting the brain development of the kids. Perhaps, those smoking parents have to think about quitting for their offspring. In short, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Hong Kong as this can bring healthy life not just to the smoker himself but also his family especially his children, and also the general public.
