I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The main priority of college students should be to study and study well, and having a part-time job might impede that priority. College students should maximize the school time to gain knowledge in order to excel in their studies and have the knowledge on-hand to be applied when they work, make friends and network, and take part in activities to hone their leadership skills and teamwork capabilities. However, having said that, it is important for college students to have internships or vacation jobs experiences so that they can have a feel of the working environment before they graduate, and can assimilate more easily into the corporate world. Part-time job, vacation job, or internship helps college students to better understand and appreciate the value of money. For those students who can manage their time properly, having a part-time job during the school term is a good learning experience for them as well. I personally do not hold part-time job during the school term so that I can focus on my studies, spend time with friends, and engage in activities. But I do take the vacation to hold full-time job or internship to gain experience and contribute to the financials of my family.
