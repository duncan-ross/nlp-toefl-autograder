Smoking is increasingly known to have strong associations with various forms of disease, such as lung and oral cancer. With much evidence pointing to the detrimental effects of smoking, there has been heated debate over the feasibility of a complete ban on smoking in the country. In my opinion, given the multitude of ill-effects of smoking, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Naysayers to this idea would probably argue that a complete ban would lead to growing discontent among the local community, and may even result in physical displays of opposition in the form of strikes. This is a possibility that must not be overlooked. Acknowledging the gravity of an immediate and complete ban on smoking, it is perceivably wiser to gradually effect the smoking ban through many stages. With the aim of being smoke-free in mind, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants could encourage other food and beverage outlets such as food courts and hawker centres to implement similar measures. Using the analogy of a ripple, a small but significant localized change can bring about an even larger positive outcome over time. As such, it is imperative that restaurants move towards a complete ban on smoking if we are to move towards a smoke-free environment as a nation.
