Part time job is very helpful to give income for us a student, we can receive some fees from it. So, we can use it for everything, for example is used to help our parents paying administration for our studying in college. In addition, when our parents have no any money, we can give them some money from our vee. Itis also gives us some preparation for work in order to we can ready when we graduate from the college. So, we can explore more experiences that we have gotten. And, when we have graduated, we do not confuse to look for a job. Because, we have had a job. As addition, it is really gives us msny experiences that we do not have before. With the experiences, as I told before, we can explore our experiences that we have.
