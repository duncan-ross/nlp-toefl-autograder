In recent year, many scholars or even government are hoping to ban smoking at all restaurants. Many studies are also indicated that people who live in a smoking-free area can keep a health body easily. In the following essay, I will go through some advantages, which are related to banning smoking at all restaurants. First of all, the number of people who are suffering from the second-hand smoke can be reduced. According to different studies, it is mentioned that second-hand smoke is dangerous than the smoke came from the tobacco. The smoke came from tobacco is also called first-hand smoke. If the government are publishing a law to completely banning smoking at all restaurants, the opportunity of getting second-hand smoke during eating, drinking or even chatting in the restaurants will be reduced. Moreover, some people can get rid of smoking due to banning smoking at all restaurants. People are needed to go to restaurant having breakfast, lunch or even dinner. Therefore, people are forced to get rid of smoking. On the other hand, since lung cancer is the top killer within different diseases, people are not willing to get such disease. If the law regarding banning smoking at all restaurants can be published, the chance of getting lung cancer can also be decreased because people are restricted to smoke at a limit area. To conclude, banning smoking at all restaurants is having many advantages. I think smoking should be prohibited at all area in the future. Therefore, I agree banning smoking at all restaurants now.
