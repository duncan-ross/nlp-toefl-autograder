I agree and also disagree. Why?? Because for information, cigarettes company in our are one of the largest income for the country and the cigarettes company have a lot of employees, if the country choose to banned or shut down their business will bring quite big effect for the country economic and the safety to. Because if the country choose to shut down them, where all of the employees should go to look for a new job to support their financial live and also how the country economic can face it. But in the other condition, smoking is not a healthy habit to for the people. But to stop all the smokers in our country is not an easy way to do. Because almost every single step we do everyday, we can see almost all of the community hold the cigarettes and lighter to light up their cigars. And the other fact that we already knew. Smokers can be divided into 2 categories, the first is one is the active smokers they are the real smokers and the second one is the passive smokers they are the people who want or don't want if they stay near with the smokers, they must inhale the smoke that came from the active smokers. On the other hand, pity for the people who are not really a smoker. They must inhale the unhealthy smoke that came from the active smokers. This is an unfair condition, but in fact that's what happen in the community life here.
