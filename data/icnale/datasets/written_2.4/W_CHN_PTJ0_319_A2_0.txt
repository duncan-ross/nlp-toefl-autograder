 Nowadays more and more Chinese college students begin to find the importance of independence, maybe because they could learn more from the abroad. So the question about college students doing part time jobs has been heated discussed. As teens, almost adults in terms of age, we not only have the energy but also have the faith that to feed us just by ourselves, which is also the signal to being a true adult owing respect both from the family the school but from the society. So trying to find some part time jobs to do is sometimes regarded as an important step to enter the society. But at the same time, we can't make it good to find the suitable job or solve other problems as we are faced with the society at first time and have little experience. Also there are many cases on the crime that teens were used to do terrible things by some adults. What's more, if students use more time in studying, they may get more than washing dishes. So to sum up, we are supposed to think twice before we want to get some part time jobs.
