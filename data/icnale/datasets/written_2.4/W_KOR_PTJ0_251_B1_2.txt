There are two reasons for that. First, having a part time job suggests that they can make money. Tuition fee of the universities is very expensive these days. On top of that, it is on the rise. Except for the few students that come from rich families, it is difficult to expect sufficient financial support for tuition, books, living, and so on from their families. Therefore, most students need to supplement their spending at least partly through part-time jobs. Second, they can experience the real world, which means they can take part in the real economic situations. College students should be ready for economic activities. College is the preparation for the upcoming social activities. When students graduate, they need to start economic activities, meaning they need to earn some money, and they need to do this for the rest of their lives. Therefore, before they enter the real world, it is important that they get sufficient practice beforehand. Through this process, they will realize how hard it is to earn money, and other than just simply earning money, it will help them with how to plan their life.
