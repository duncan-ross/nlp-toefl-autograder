I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are several reasons. First, college students have much free time in their daily life, if they spend time on playing games, surfing the Internet for not thing or other meaningless things is so bad. Second, they can learn some skills in many different jobs, at the same time, they may explore the job they really suitable and like in the future. Third, they can make many friends from different background, school, etc. The friendship establishes on work together will be tough and maintain longer than under other situation. Forth, they will find how difficult to earn money by themselves, so that they will cherish things and thank their parents more and more. There are many reasons for college students have a part-time job, but so many parents disagree they do so. Why? Parents worry about they waste time and hurt themselves. Shouldn't protect them in "warm room", in fact, it will limit them learn by themselves; let them miss chances to grow. So, I think that college students have a part-time job is useful to their life. Trust them, will mature gradually!
