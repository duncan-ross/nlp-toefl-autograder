From my point of view, I couldn't agree with forbidding smoking in public place any more for the following reasons. Above all, it is not only the smoker's health but also all the health of people around him that someone smokes in public will make a bad effect on. Take me for an example. Though my father never smokes, I still often cough out of the bad air made by smoking. Undoubtedly, there's something to do with smoking in public place. In other words, the success of the volunteers appealing us not to smoke is easily in vain because our health is still affected by smoke. What's more, if smoking is forbidden in public place, there will be a great improvement in our environments. It is obvious that the abandoned cigarrit will become rubbish. More importantly, many people are not aware that they should throw them into dustbins. No wonder there are ciggrats in the streets here and there. Only by forbidding smoking in public place can we solve the problem. Most importantly, in this way, we can decrease the chance that children are addicted to smoke. There is no doubt that children are will to do what the grown-ups do. If they see a lot of adults smoking in the public place, they are easily to follow them. Even though they discover that smoking is harmful, they can hardly get rid of it. In a word, I hold the view that smoking in public place should be forbidden.
