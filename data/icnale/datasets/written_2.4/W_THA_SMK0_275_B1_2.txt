It should be banned, definitely. And the reason is, smoking is dangerous to not only the smokers, everyone who's standing near the smoker also suffers from the 'might of the nicotine' too. However, there're still more of things I want to talk about it. Okay, let me talk about this topic a bit more. As I've already stated above, smoking should be completely banned because of its 'smoking dangerous' characteristics, and it should find its edge of extinction as soon as possible. Smoking is like a suicide, you know? Because the more you smoke, the sooner you'll meet your maker. If you aren't dead, then some parts of your body may be devastated by tar and nicotine. These substances are the harbinger of cancer and other kinds of diseases, which are more than potential to kick you to the graveyard or the cremation site. It really is dangerous as I've said, I dare say. Oh, I've almost forgotten one thing; smoking also causes the weather bad, full of bad smelling smoke isn't a good thing for your health. That's it, that's the reason why the restaurants owners all over our country should ban smoking from their working places. And those smokers should find another ways to relax themselves from tension and other things that make them feel discomfort. Case closed.
