About smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think the public ban on smoking in a bill that must be performed. I have the following three examples. The first point, many medical studies that the ingredients contained in the cigarettes will lead us to human health hazards. If the resulting disease, which will cause the waste of medical resources of our country. Secondly, cigarettes, and numerous compounds, will seriously pollute our air quality, if smoking in restaurants and other indoor areas, the pollution caused by certain more serious such an outcome will not only affect the power of the other guests do not smoke will pollute our food. Third, smoking, and cigarette butts left behind after the ash will cause environmental pollution. If not properly handled, is bound to become environmental issues. For these three reasons, I agree that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places and restaurants. I suggest that smoking in all restaurants are prohibited. Finally I suggest for a license restaurant smoking be allowed in their premises (should be quite easy to get). License will allow smoking are willing to provide good air-conditioning installation, reducing the number of tobacco on a specific particle in the air.
