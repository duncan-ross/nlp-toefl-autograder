 Since the discovery of tobacco, smoking has been popular worldwide. In the new century, the number of smokers has been increasing rapidly. As a result, many smokers have got diseases which they suffer from a lot. To prevent the bad effects caused by smoking, I think it is important to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. For one thing, smoking can bring diseases to both smokers and people around them. Most smokers hooked by cigarettes cannot be as fashionable as the stars, but they may get lung diseases like pneumonia, even lung cancer. According to modern medical science, smoking is also linked to heart disease and bronchitis. It is reported that smoking is responsible for millions of death around the world every year. A restaurant is a serving place. It's illegal to harm other people's health there. For another, smoking is just a waste of time. People might smoke because they feel confused or annoyed. However, one can never solve his problems by smoking. If people in a restaurant spend the time considering the situations instead of smoking, they may come up with methods to solving their problems. Besides, smoking pollutes the air. Not all the people can bear having a delicious meal in a restaurant full of smoke. Smoking is bad for the elevation of a country's image in the world. To sum up, I insist that banning smoking be completely at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. Only in this way can people become healthier and happier.
