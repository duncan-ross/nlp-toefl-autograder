I agree with banning smoking in restaurants because of smoking disturbing other people who intended to eat. I agree that smoking does not benefit anything, both to yourself and those people around you, for me I think that smoking should be punished whether they smoke in the restaurants or public places such as bus stop, park, markets. There are many diseases come visit us if we smoke, and people close to us at the time. I do not want to have people smoking in restaurants and other places. When I saw people smoke in public places, I wish I could stop them to smoke. The smell is terrible, I saw many people they have a cough when they got the smoke from the cigarette. Poor them. I hate the smoke of the cigarette also. I don't think that they got any benefits from smoking. But people around them are dying. If it is possible, the policy should be serious with smoking in public areas and restaurants. Now I saw many restaurants are trying to promote non smoking. They try to not allow people to smoke in the restaurants. Some of them are successful because they are serious with that. If all of us are serious with this problem, we can ban the smoking in any areas.
