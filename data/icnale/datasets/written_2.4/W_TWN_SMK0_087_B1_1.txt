I agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants may be full of some no-smoking people. If there are people don't smoke, smoking in the restaurants is a big problem for us who don't smoke. And smoking is bad for health and mood; I don't want to smell the smoke when eating something delicious. Once when I was eating at a restaurant with my family happily, the neighbor just took out a cigarette and began smoking. That smell really shocked us down, we started cough again and again and couldn't talk anymore. We started eating quickly as fast as possible thinking about to get those people away. After we left the restaurant, we finally felt comfortable and started chatting again. After that horrible accident, I totally agree with that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Another example is my close friend, Dennis, who was an athlete at high school. I felt sad for him because he began smoking after graduating. His health had a big problem when he found that his every breath was becoming more and more difficult. "You had better quit smoking if you want to live longer, " the doctor told him. I agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not all people like the smoking smell. Furthermore, Smoking is bad for health and is bad for mood when eating, too.
