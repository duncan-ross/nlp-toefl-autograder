Smoking is a very bad thing. Someone who smokes has to abstain from smoking as soon as possible, and others who do not smoke should keep their good habits. Smoking is undoubtedly harmful to our health; people who smoke or smell the smoke are included. First of all, the ingredients in the cigarettes, especially tobacco, are proved to be able to destroy our organs and the nerve system a lot. Second, the bad smell usually makes people feel sick and can't stand the smell. By the way, I don't smoke, and every time I smell the smoke, I feel disgusted, and get a strong headache for a long time. Moreover, smoke will also cause damage to the environment. Because of the reasons mentioned above, we should do something to relief such a bad situation, which all of us do not want it to be more serious. We should ask our kids to keep far away from smoking, and make posters or videos to make people know the terrible result of smoking. Also, we should set an organization and a system to help smoking people cut out smoking. I believe if we keep calling on the disadvantages of smoking, the number of smoking people reduces.
