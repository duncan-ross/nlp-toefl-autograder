I don't agree with smoking. Smoking is not good for ourselves, but in Taiwan, many people smokes, even my fother. I remember when I was a child, I always forbided my fother smoked in our house, but it didn't work. My fother somked outside. I was disappointed, but I didn't give up. When I saw my fother smoking, I removed his smoke. After thousand times, I quite. My mother also told my fother not smoking or his health would be in danger, but it didn't work. I also saw my classmates smoking around my school when I was a junior high school student. My teacher punish them, but they still smoked. It was terrible then. After I went to senior high school, we changed our place to live, far from my father's factory, so that I won't smell so much smokes. I also had good grades at our new house, not only on my study but also on my piano. Maybe I would get a friend who likes smoking, but I would tell she not to smoke when she met me or dated me. I even got my best friend who smoking, but I don't care. I always told them that smoking was not a good hobby, some people would listen to me and quite smoking. I was so happy to hear that because I would think of helping a person to solve his life! Smoking is not good at our health, try our best to go away smoking places and don't touch any smoke.
