I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoking is not just bad for the smoker but also those around them. By allowing smokers to smoke in the restaurant, those non-smoker patrons will become victims of second hand smoke. Also it will leave a stench in the restaurant which would be rather unpleasant for customers to consume the food. Furthermore, there might be a possibility of those smokers not throwing the unwanted used cigarettes into the cigarette dish but elsewhere which might cause a fire incident. Nowadays, many people in Singapore are quite health-conscious. They also have been educated about the harmful results of second-hand smoking. No one would like to be "kill" by those smokers in early age. If they see someone smoking in the restaurant, they might not want to dine in the restaurant. They would rather go other restaurant or food store. The restaurant would then definitely incur a loss. Which owner will like to see their business suffer losses? None will. Also by allowing people to smoke in restaurant, it will just encourage those smokers to continue to smoke. However, it is the other way round that should be encourage --- stop smoking. Therefore for the sake of majority innocent people and its own business as well, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore.
