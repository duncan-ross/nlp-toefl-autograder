Smoking is banned gradually in everywhere. For people's health, smoking is banned that is unstoppable tendency. But I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are reasons below. Like most of people, I don't like smoke very much. Because it is bad for health and it doesn't have good smell. More and more researches point out that smoking lead to lung cancer in most cases. Otherwise, the bad smell of smoke influences people's desire of food and frame of mind at the restaurant. However, others people like the smell of smoke and enjoy it. People who are smoking that will not affect them. And some of them are smoker. The probability of getting lung cancer of people even of themselves which doesn't the matter. Because they just like smoking. Smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants which makes smokers pain. But if it doesn't ban, it makes them who do not smoke suffering. If the restaurant has enough space, maybe it could be divided into two spaces for each. People doing things in each different space would affect each other. Therefore, no one would complain. To avoid conflicts, smoking should be not completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. How to satisfy each one is the most important thing what we should do.
