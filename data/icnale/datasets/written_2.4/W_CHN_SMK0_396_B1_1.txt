As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restautants in the country. Smoking is such a dangerous and harmful thing that if a baby swallow an end of a cagarette, he is very likely to die and the boiled water from a bunch of them makes a effective insecticide. In addition, dozens of illnesses, like lung cancer, have close relation with it. Not only does smoking does harm to the smokers'health, but it is also a threat to the people around the smokers. It's called the second hand smoking. We shouldn't only think about the right of smokers, but take non-smokers's health into consideration. Public places, like restaurants, is where many people gather together. One's smoking will have great impact on many other people's feeling and health. If we don't banned smoking completely, it's no difference from encouranging smokers to continue smoking, which is very inhuman. As a children grew up in a environment surrounded by smokers, I do know the significance of ban of smoking in the restaurants. The smell of smoke deprives my appetite and leads to my coughing. Restanraut shoule be a place for eating, instead of committing suicide. So, for the reason I list above, I believe it makes a difference to ban smoking completely in restaurant, or even all public places.
