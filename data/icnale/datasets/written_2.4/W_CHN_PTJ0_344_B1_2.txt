 Every year, hundreds of thousands of undergraduates head into the talent market, trying their best to earn a decent job. However, the number of job vacancies is far smaller than that of job applicants. Then comes a socially realistic question:What on earth is the core ability that company HRs do appreciate? From my perspective, academic knowledge, though a very essential part of an undergraduate's overall quality, only accounts for a relatively small portion. One's soft power including communication skills practical experiences, independent spirits and social network may play a more important role. In most cases, we can achieve these skills through the experience of doing a part-time job. As knowledge-receivers, we have beening accumulating all kinds of information, methods to deal with problems and thinking patterns from parents, various teachers and friends only to find we have nowhere to put these skills into use. Doing a part-time job, you can fully keep in touch with the society and all sorts of people and learn to adapt what you've achieved in classes to real problems. Besides, you can earn your pocket money and try to be an independent young adult both materially and psychologically because you have to be responsible for what you've done and realize the fact that once stepping into the place you work, you are no longer the apple of your parents' eye at home, having no pressure. What's more, doing a part-time job means you've been a temperary working member of this society, which grants you a lot of opportunities to make friends with people who may someday offer you help. We modern Chinese college students should focus our attention on something beneficial in a long run. We are not a generation that are willing to be kept in the ivory tower of college any more. We take the initiative to explore this world. So why don't you go and find a part-time job to fully taste the joy and sorrow of a job?
