Everyone knows that smoking is not a good thing. It will hurt your body, get cancers, even hurt the people you don't know, they just close to you unlucky. So the government has planned to ban smoking at all the public place, like restaurants, shopping malls and train stations. The effect is not good as it predicted. People still smoking everywhere. To protect most non-smoking people, some public places set smoking area that put smokers together. I extremely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants, even all over the country. The reason is very simple: smoking is bad! For the health of country, we should stop making or input cigarette. I don't like the smell of smoke, and I believe that most people are the same. I don't know why the smokers started to smoke. They insist smoking though the healthy tax is heavier and heavier. And there's quite a lot of clubs promote the disease that smoking makes. Smokers still smoke. I hope them will understand how foolish they are someday. But I cannot stand smoking in the restaurant. Try to imagine that you were ready to have a meal that looks very delicious. Suddenly the disgusted smell flied into your nose. Won't you want to kill the man who destroyed your dinner? That's why I agree to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
