I disagree because I truly believe that it is not important at all. How can students be expected to perform at their best when they are tired, distracted or haven't spent enough time studying their course content. And that's just one argument against working. The other is that students are at college to study and give their best efforts in order to get the highest scores that they can so that they can stand a better chance of landing a really good job. If they have to worry about working as well, it is impossible to focus the majority of their efforts on doing what they are supposed to be doing which is studying to pass their degree and graduate. Added to that the issue of stress and unnecessary extra pressure that they have to go through in order to reach their goal, only worsens the situation. I know because I had a part-time job and it was a real nightmare for me. I don't quite know how I did it, but I made it all the way through college and graduated. If I had to do it all again though, I would be beg, borrow or steal the money so that I didn't have to work. Yeah, I made it, but at what cost to my physical and mental health? Time will tell I guess.
