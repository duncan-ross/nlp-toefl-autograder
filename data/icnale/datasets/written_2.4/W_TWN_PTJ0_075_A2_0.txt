Without doubt, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Before college, we live at home and enjoyed parents' love and care. So when we first time have the chance to live alone outside, we must have to study how to take care ourselves and be a real person. I had a lot of part-time job experience, I used to worked at a restaurant, is really hard and tired. Every day as I finished my school class, I take bus to my work place. The restaurant is far from my school, so I usually review the school subject during the time. There were always lots of people come to my store and eat dinner, I needed to stand for a long time and walked over and over again around the restaurant, it is almost made me crazy. But the boss and the other people worked in the restaurant we really friendly and they treated me as if we were family. The customs also nice to me. Sometimes they even gave me some little gift. I was very appreciated about this job and the people who I met. I really learn lot from this job, but it is important that should not spent too much time at job, after all, we are still a student, we have to do what we should do. If we can make good use of our time, have a part-time job is a very good experience.
