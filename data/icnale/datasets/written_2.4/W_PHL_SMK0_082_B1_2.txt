Smoking is dangerous in our health. This sentence has been heard from time to time but still smoking exists in the Philippines. Addiction to cigarette is not new to the Filipinos whether you're rich or poor, with hair or not, youth or old. Some cigarettes may be expensive, and some are cheap. But whatever the price is, smoking has been part of their daily habit. Cigarette produces smoke that is proven to be dangerous or the health especially to the second smoker or those people who inhales the smoke of the user. This won't do any good to our teeth and lips as well. Cigarettes also can cause fire if not disposed properly. This is why it should be banned to all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are closed area with lots of people in it with the purpose of eating and getting together. Letting even few people smoke at this places will affect the entire population in the restaurant. It would be very dangerous for the other people in the restaurant although they aren't the one smoking. This could be very cautious to fire. Discipline and respect or other people is the key to stop this. Cigarettes may not be considered as an entirely bad thing because it will not exist in the market if it does. Restaurants are all over the country. And it is meant to be a place to eat and not to smoke and absolutely not a place to gain diseases or health problems. We have to reconsider those people around us.
