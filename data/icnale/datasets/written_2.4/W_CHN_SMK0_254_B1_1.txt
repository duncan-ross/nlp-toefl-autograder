 No matter how others think about smoking, I believe smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Millions of people die from smoking each year. What is worse is that smoking not only ruins the smokers' own health, but also breaks the health of all the persons who stay with them. When a person smokes in the restaurant, the harmful gases will escape into others' lungs. For this reason, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country, even in the world. I even think all the public place should have no smoking at all, but it is too difficult to come true. Rome is not build in one day. We cannot hope that all the smokers are away from the cigarette in a few days, so we should do something to help the smokers before they stop smoking. We should allow smokers smoke in some place alone in all restaurants in our country, but they mustn't smoke once they are not in the smoking area. Smoking has no good for everyone, but there are so many persons smoking in the world. Their reasons are various, but there is only one result, which is not good. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country.
