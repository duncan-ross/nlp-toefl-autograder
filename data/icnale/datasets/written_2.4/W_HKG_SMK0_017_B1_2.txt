Restaurants in Hong Kong have been divided into two zones---non-smoking area and smoking area for the sake of public's health. However, only if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, can the aim be achieved. Nowadays the air quality in restaurants is not as clean as we think. Smoking always produces harmful particles, like sulphur, nicotine, tar, etc. Nonetheless, they are invisible to human. The harmful particles produced are trapped in restaurants and flow from smoking area to non-smoking area. The air we breathe in is actually contains many impurities. Prolong staying in a restaurant which has a smoking area do harm to people, especially the workers here. Moreover, there are many people go to restaurants, ranging from infants to elderly. The harmful particles can easily damage their health. Some people may argue that completely banning of smoking in restaurants demolish smokers' human right. In a society, we should make a comprehensive consideration before making any decisions---balance between individuals' interests and the whole society's. All decisions we made should base on most citizens' interests. Banning of smoking is proposed to be applied in restaurants only. The government or some social communities have set up some smoking zones for smokers which show their care to smokers. If you were a smoke, would you smoke in a living room and let your family take in second-hand smoke? To most parents, they would like to go to toilet and take cigarette alone. It is the same situation. Please be more considerate. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the healthy development of the society.
