For me Part time job is not applicable for students because students must focus themselves in studying their lessons. Some students cannot do their household chores and they will have their part time job in a company what do you think will they do there. There are a lot of disadvantages for having a part time job if you are still a student, first the balance of time in school and at your work, next the distance because sometimes the distance from school and your workplace, another is your allowance is it fit for your fare going to school and going to your work for your projects and other school fees, and of course your health do you think your body can sustain the tiredness that you feel because you will study at the same time you will work. Working and studying is very stressful. What if you have examination you cannot focus on your study habit because of you are tired. But if there are disadvantages there are also advantages part time job is a big help for those students who has financial problems and to those who are hardworking they know how to balance their time very well. If your work is not that hard well you are lucky enough rather than those who has a very difficult job and at the same time small salary. The salary that you get you can use it for your tuition fees and other important things and at the same time it teaches us how to balance our time properly and become hardworking people. In part time jobs what we can get there is the experience and we can use that in the future.
