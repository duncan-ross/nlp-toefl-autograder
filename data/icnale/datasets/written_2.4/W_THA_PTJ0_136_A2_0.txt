If you never do something special in a university life, you should try to find extra work to do more. At least they have the money to use during class. I know it's tired, if compared to those who study only. But if you ask me that is happy or not, I said clearly that I am happy with the money I acquire or earn by my own. I am very proud to tell anyone that this is my money, the money from my effort. My family still pays me but I can save more money into my bank account. Someday I plan to study in other countries so when that day comes, my family won't pay much or pay very less for the study. Not only money but I learn from a lot how to be a strong one. When I think to the past, I see a lot of mistakes that I do about using money. It's like when I want to buy drinks or foods or clothes, I just spend and very careless. Then I become broke. My parents don't know that I have to borrow money from friends. But now, I have to be another new one. I learn how to work and save money and I feel happy every time I got money from my boss. Like everyone to know that I can and do good. So everyone can do it.
