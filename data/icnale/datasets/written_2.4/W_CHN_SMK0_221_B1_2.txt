There is a theory that nearly every one knows, but millions of people ignore it. That is smoking does harm to one's health. Luckily, more and more people realized the harm of smoking. Recently, a ban was carried out that smoking is banned at all public place in the country. I totally agree with this ban. Following are some reasons. First and the most important one, many people know, smoking not only damages the health of the smoker, but also attacks the people around the smoker. Even some researches show that the fog others get in does more harm than the fog smoker get in. So, it's necessary to carry out the ban. It obviously benefits nearly all the people. Secondly, the fog makes the restaurant smelly. Especially in summer and winter, air conditioner is on, and the windows and doors are always closed, then the air in the restaurants will be very bad. For I, I usually feel not like eating much food in that kind of environment. For example, once, I went to a restaurant to have lunch. The food there was delicious so there will were always many people. However, it didn't matter, the problem was that there were many people smoking just besides me! That really bothered me a lot, I even didn't get full that day. As far as I'm concerned, every one should support the ban, for it brings benefits to everybody.
