A part-time job is an employment where you work a few more hours than a full-time job. Many college students take part in part-time jobs mostly because they want to help their family, earn for themselves or learn to be more responsible. Some college students also apply for part-time jobs to train themselves and know what it is like when they already have their own jobs in the future. Other colleges and universities offer students to take part-time jobs on their graduating years for them to gain more knowledge in taking care of your own job. But there is a down side when students take on jobs while they are still studying. Working and studying for students at the same time can be really hectic and stressful. Too much work can lead to depression and lack of sleep. Working too much can eat a lot of time in your social life, studying time, sleeping time and also time for yourself. If I were to be given a chance to be offered a part-time job, I would choose a time where I am ready and I know how to manage my time. I do not recommend those college students who are already struggling with their studies to take part on a part-time job. (213)
