This is a great idea and I wholeheartedly agree. With all the knowledge that we have available to us related to smoking, passive smoking and associated diseases, there is no reason in the world why anybody should be smoking these days anyway. I think that it would be a good thing for Japan even though I believe that there would be some initial resistance to the ban. It would be for the greater good of all concerned and it should take effect as soon as possible. Some may argue that restaurants would lose money, but I believe that over a period of time, Japanese people and visitors to Japan would come to accept the ban in the normal course of events. Additionally, Japan may want to consider imposing a ban on smoking in all public places and not just restrict it to restaurants only. I feel that health care costs would be lowered which in turn would provide some relief to the economy in a small way. The upside being that the risk of contracting smoking related diseases would also be lowered considerably if this were to happen. All in all, I feel that this would provide some safeguards for those who don't smoke and it would also inspire more confidence in the Japanese Government.
