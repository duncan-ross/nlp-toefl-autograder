From my personal point of view, college students should have a part-time job. It will bring more advantages to their lives especially financial and social skill. For financial, it is good for students that they can earn money by themselves without bothering money from their parents, so that students might bother their parents' money only for tuition. Beside, they could gain more social skill from their works. For example, they might meet more people from many backgrounds, so I think it is good for students to learn about other people and they could lean how to live with different people. So, students will have more living skill to live in the society of variation. Moreover, doing a part-time job might widen students' worldview. For instance, some student might be very shy in the class, but when they live in the outside society, they might not be shy anymore. On the other hand, having a part-time job also has some problem; it might interrupt students' class hour sometimes. In my opinion, I think it is not a big deal for students who do want to have a part-time job. It is because they should know their limit to do a part-time job. So, part-time job will not waste their study. Anyway, having a part-time job of college students brings them more advantages though.
