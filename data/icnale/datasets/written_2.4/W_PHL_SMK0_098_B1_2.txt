Smoking kills people slowly, people who smoke doesn't know that their body is being ruined by the cigarettes that they are smoking. According to cigarette advertisements cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health but still many people smoke. Smoking is really harmful to the health of the smoker but it is more harmful to those who inhale it or the second hand smokers, those people doesn't smoke but they're the one who is more affected. I really don't know why people smoke; I don't know what they get from smoking. Restaurants should ban smoking in there establishment because it has great effect on their customers who don't smoke, customers that is non-smoker will be the second hand smoker and they will be the one who will suffer more. Some people smoke after they eat for some reason I don't know, it's like a food for them they can't live without it. Not only in restaurants that smoking should be ban but also in other public places to lessen the unhealthy cause of the smoke especially to those who doesn't smoke. There should only be a specific place where can people smoke so they won't affect others. It's not bad to smoke but next time you do it make sure that you're the only one who will suffer of the consequences and not the people around you.
