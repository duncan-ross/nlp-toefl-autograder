In this day and age, there are many college students who take up part-time jobs for their own various reasons. For some, it serves as an extra source of income, while others could be supporting themselves. Nonetheless, is it really that important for college students to have a part-time job? I believe that it is good for students to take up part-time jobs, however, having a part-time job as a student means that one would have less time and energy to channel towards school and schoolwork. Students would have to manage their time well and if they do not succeed in doing so, chances are that their studies will probably suffer at the expense of the part-time job. When their studies start suffering, the importance level of the part-time job decreases. I feel that their energy should be focused on doing well in school, and if there is no need for the student to support his or herself, it is definitely not important for them to have a part-time job. However, it is also good for college students to take up part-time jobs, because it teaches them to be a little bit more independent and responsible. When they have part-time jobs, they have to balance their time for work and school. This will teach them to maximize their time, and in addition, they will also earn a little bit of financial independence so they do not have to rely on their parents all the time. Overall, I feel that it is good if students can take up part-time jobs, but it is not of such importance that it becomes a necessity. Sure, it teaches one to manage their time better and provides a little more spending money, but it is definitely not important unless one needs the money to survive. (300 words)
