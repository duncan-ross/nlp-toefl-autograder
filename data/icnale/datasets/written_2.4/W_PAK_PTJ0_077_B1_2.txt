College studies are quite tough. Every subject takes at least two hours if being read daily. A student who wants to excel should have his mind face of other matters, anxiety and worries, peaceful environment and conditions applying studies help students get good marks. Now days necessities are touching the sky and every family can't afford their children education, but poor parents get their children admitted an Govt. schools. When these children reach college studies they find their parents living from hand to mouth which specifically that their parent's expensive college studies. So, they start part time job to fulfill their stationary needs. This is terrible for their health as well as their studies. These students become weak day by day due to long working hours of part time jobs. It therefore become impossible for them to pay attention to their studies and ultimately they lose the race. On the other hand there are those students who are not poor but they want to live independently so they find part time jobs. These students think they mature and engage themselves in long working hours. Certainly they can't achieve their goals because if they want to live independently they should have enough money and they can earn money only through education. This step loses their abilities to research and discover more and in the end they are at a big lose.
