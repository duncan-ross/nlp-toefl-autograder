 As we all know that smoking is bad for our health. So should smoking be allowed in the public place has made a big discussion in the society. Some people consider that it may be very difficult to stop the people from smoking in the public place because there are so many people smoke and it may cause some serious problems as it can not be accept by so large number of people. But another part of people don't agree with them. There are so many people dead from smoking every year in the world and there are many unhealthy babies born according their parents' smoking. And when people smoke in the public place, it can be dangerous to our safe as many conflagrations are caused by the burning cigarette. The air will smell badly and be poisonous. I have the view that smoking in the public place shouldn't be allowed, but we must consider the people who are smoking. So we can make a smoking room for the people who smoke in the public place. It may good for health and can be accepted by everyone. The measures also can be made effectively and our society will be much more harmonious.
