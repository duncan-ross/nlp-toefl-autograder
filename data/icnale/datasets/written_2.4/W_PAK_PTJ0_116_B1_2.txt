Part time job is the activity which a person performs a part from its major daily activites. part time job as most commonly seen in students. some other people are alsoinvolved inthis. students mainly involve in part time jobs to become independent and to fulfil their own needs. the want to be independent and desires not to become a load on their parents that's why tobecome finacialy andstable they adopt different part time jobs. A part from finaincial point of view a few of them are involved in this to get some kind of experience which would be helpful in their future life. lets take an example of a MBA student who is part time working in a bankor in a multinational company. then his expevience will be more precious then the salary he gets. his or her experince will aid him during whole his professional life. most popular part time jobs are teaching in an academy working in bank in evening in a multinational company. a part from students some professional people are also involved in part time jobs. they require more money to fulfil the needs of their family. the jobs they do could not give them much money so they spend extra time to get desives meet. I think it is a healthy activity because it helps to spend time in a good way.
