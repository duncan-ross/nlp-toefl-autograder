Nowadays, many university students do part-time jobs when they are free. I think this is a healthy phenomenon. The reasons are as follows, First, I think doing part-time job can let students know money is precious. When they do their part-time job, they have to do their work hardly, so that they can receive the salary each month. This can let students know money is difficult to earn and money is so precious so that they will not be idle away their money and use them in a proper way. Also, doing part-time job can let students explore more experience during the job. Nowadays, many firms requires their labours having experience before joining their companies. If people do not have enough experience, it is too difficult for them to be recruited. Part-time job is a good opportunity for them to get enough experience before they go to their society. This is a good change for them to equip themselves well. Finally, doing part-time job can make students use their time efficiently. As in the university, students can choose their classes up to their desiring, students' time is more flexible than those in secondary school. By doing more part-time, students can make use of their time efficiently. By conclusion, part-time job is a good opportunity for university students, being benefits to them.
