 I hold the view that the students should have a part time job. Nowadays, fierce competition is everywhere in society, so preparing for the future as soon as possible is more and more important for our student. Having a part time job is a good way to improve our abilities which can lay a firm foundation of future life in society. First having a part time job can reduce some students' economic burden; the income earned by part time job can help them accomplish the study in university. They can also some money to buy what they like and improve their life. Second, part time job give the students a good opportunity to enter the society and work with others in which they can learn how to cooperate in a group and live with others, which is important after they graduate from university. Third, the happiness when obtain the money earned by their work can make them become more confident, which will make them behave better both in study and work. Fourth, students who have a part time job have to face to all kinds of problems during the work, their parents are usually not with them, and so they have to deal with them problems alone, by which they will be more independent. Fifth part time job is also a chance for students to learn how to run a company which is good to their own business. Have so many advantages, having a part time job is a good choice.
