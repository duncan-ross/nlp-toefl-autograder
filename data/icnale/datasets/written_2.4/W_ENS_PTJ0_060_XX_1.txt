There are many benefits of having a part-time job for college students, so I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. By having a part-time job, students are able to expand their set of skills and to expand the set of talents that they will use when they one day find a career. This is very important because if students cannot become skilled enough to find a fulltime job after they graduate, they will have wasted part of their lives in college. I agree that it is very important for college students to spend a lot of their time studying, but a few hours of part-time work every week shouldn't be so bad that students start to fail their classes and start cutting classes too. Therefore, any student who thinks that having a part-time job is a bad idea is simply afraid of having to work a little bit hard or to do some great things for himself. Many people have some strange psychological fear of success, and they allow this to impact their career and life choices as well as their level of happiness. So, buck up, find a part-time job, and start working your way to happiness today.
