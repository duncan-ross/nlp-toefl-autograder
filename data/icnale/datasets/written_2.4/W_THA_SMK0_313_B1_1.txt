In my opinion, I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country but not at all. The smoke from cigarettes has pollution and bad smell to people who are in restaurant. The smoke from cigarettes will disturb people who are eating their breakfast, lunch, or their dinner in restaurant that doesn't have area for smoking. So people who want to smoke could choose the restaurant that has area for smoking. Well, people who smoke should care about children and pregnant women around them because the smoke from smoker's cigarettes has pollution and dioxins that can disturb them. Adults think that smoking or smoke outside the home when children are not children will safe. This idea is not valid because smoke from cigarettes, affixed to hair and clothes of smokers it can make children to be allergy. Furthermore the smokers will be like a panda because they will have black eyes and will have black mouth. They will cough much; it will make them in suffer. They will get lung cancer. If they don't have treatment early, they maybe die. They could think about there life more than they think today. The best way to safe life is don't smoke! It will be better for smokers and people around them.
