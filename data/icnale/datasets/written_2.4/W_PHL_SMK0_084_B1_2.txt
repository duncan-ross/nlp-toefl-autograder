I consider myself as someone who is health conscious. Every time I walk past smokers, I always remember to pull out my handkerchief and cover my nose, or in some instances, hold my breath for a few seconds. According to studies second hand smoking is much more dangerous than first hand. That is why it is important to ban smoking in restaurants. Think about it, if you inhale second hand smoke, you sustain more damage than the first hand smoker. Most smokers tend to smoke inside or outside restaurants, usually with their friends. This must stop. There are a lot of customers which the restaurants attend to, not only adults but children as well. It would be wrong if children, at a tender age, would inhale the second hand smoke of the smokers in restaurants. Smoking shall be banned in restaurants, for it will affect the health condition of the other customers that are being served. These customers may not fully realize that their health condition is already suffering from second hand smoking. A good approach to this problem, would be requiring smokers to move in private areas were their actions would not harm other individuals. Therefore, other customers would no longer be affected by the serious case of second hand smoking.
