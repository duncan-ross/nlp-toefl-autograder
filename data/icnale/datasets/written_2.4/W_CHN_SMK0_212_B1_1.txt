Where there is air, there is smoking. Though the terrible effect of smoking is already known to every adolescence and adult, there is never a trend that smoking will disappear. Yet, we should still insist that less smoking is better for our life after thinking about why the trend exists. The very first step is again to speak medical side effects of smoking. Not only will smoking will damage the lung tissue in the body, the polluted air, which contains nicotine, further interferes the persons around the smoker. The second-handed smoke now has been proved to be more harmful. We could say that if the legal system were more strict, the smoker could have been sued for millions times. But why there is no trend that smoking will disappear?  Firstly, it is because of the extravagant profit from the cigarette industry. As it is the retained profit for those cigarette companies, there is rare chance that they will give up the opportunities to earn the money. Secondly, the customers will use the cigarettes as gifts so that they can show their preference for others. Some will also think the cigarettes symbolise their social status. In another word, the market of cigarette trade still maintains intact. Thirdly, smokers will just get addicted to smoking—that is the most troublesome. As long as these reasons exist, the people's life will be affected for one more day, and more happiness will be deprived of. So, let's act to reduce the use of cigarette, and there will be less annoyance resulting from smoking.
