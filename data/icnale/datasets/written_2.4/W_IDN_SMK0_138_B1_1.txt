As we know that smoking has more dangerous than the benefit. But up to know still many people smoke, even they have known about the dangerous of it. I agree if smoking banned in the restaurant. More over if it banned in all of the places. Because restaurant is the common place. Many people come there. Not only gentlemen but the ladies are also there. So if smoking is still never mind used in the restaurant, it will disturb the guest there. Beside of it, we are as the owner and the user this earth, so we have to take care our earth. If the smokers smoke everywhere, more over in the public place, it same with that they kill people slowly. Because the smoke will come to the body and will be illness. The passive smoker is more dangerous than the active smoker The government must be active to forbid the smokers to smoke in the restaurant in order to make the sterile place from smoke, and make the guest fell happy and not disturbed when come to the restaurant. And surely the restaurant will be full of the visitors. So who wants to live healthy, so must aware that smoking is very dangerous, and must be banned in the public place especially in the restaurant as the food place and rest place.
