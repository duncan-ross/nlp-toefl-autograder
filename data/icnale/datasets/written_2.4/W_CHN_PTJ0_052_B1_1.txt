Sometimes many college students gain a great knowledge of theory, while they really lack of practice experience. So I strongly believe that our college students need to do a part time job indeed. Several reasons are as follows. Firstly, you will be stubborn about something in your life as you just insist in the theoretical knowledge if you learn all the things in books instead of combining theory and practice. Be careful about the situation whether you are just reading books but do nothing. Secondly, after a short time of 4 years study in college, you are required to find a job immediately. It's certainly for you to treasure the time and to make a full use of the time. To do a part time job is a good choice, as you make your knowledge grow continually; you also get the practical experience of how to survive in the complicated society. Finally, you can add some colorful experiences to your resume when you are interviewed by a company, so you have the advantage over others as you have the ability to finish the work efficiently. It is all due to the part time job. In my opinion, it's necessary for college students to have a part time job to gain the work experience.
