Nowadays, the society cannot emphasize the important than to quit smoking. It is universally acknowledged that Smoking is harmful to your health. However, whether smoking should be permitted in the restaurants or not is a serious problem to think over. There are about two sides followed about this, most people include me insist on that any public area, like restaurant, must stay away from smoking. Smoke is not only terrible for people's lungs, but also the spark maybe causes a fire. At the same time, people should observe common courtesy when they in the public places, and try their best not to affect others activity. If they are smoking, the others will feel uncomfortable without doubt. Standing on these disadvantages, they hope the country banned at all the restaurants completely. Despite its merits, it also brings some problems to solve. For instance, someone, especially some adult male addicts to cigarette, they have dinner at the restaurant sometime, maybe they thought the dinner cannot without smoke, so that they cannot help themselves to use lighters. So, I rarely reach an absolute consensus on such a controversial issue. After a thorough consideration, I suggest that the country can set the majority of restaurants without any smoke, at the same time let the minority of allowed to smoke. Only in this way, I think, maybe can solve this complicated problem.
