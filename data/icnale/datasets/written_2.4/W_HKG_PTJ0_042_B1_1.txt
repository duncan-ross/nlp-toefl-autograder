Part-time job is considered to be one of the must-have experiences for university students. Having a part-time job can fill up the leisure time, make money, and acquire working experience. Thus I believe getting part-time job would have positive impact on students. There are lots more freedom in university, students can plan the timetable by themselves. Besides, the number of lessons that they have are usually relatively small. Therefore they would have more free time, and doing part-time job is a good way to spend the time. As university students, people nowadays most likely don't want to rely too much on the family and don't want to bring much burden on them, part-time would be a good way for them to earn money. The most frequent jobs that students take up are usually salesman, tutorial teacher or waiter. These kinds of jobs are easy to handle and students can earn a living without too much hard work. After graduation, university students will step into the society and find a full-time job. Most of the employers give interviewees who have working experiences a higher priority. Even though the part-time job that they had before may not be relevant to their new job, the interview skill and communication skill that they acquire before are useful for getting all kinds of job. University students must benefit from doing part-time job in a way that it can prevent students from wasting their time, giving them income so as to reduce the financial burden of their family and equip them for future job.
