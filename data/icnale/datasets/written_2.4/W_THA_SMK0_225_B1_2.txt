I think, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, I hate cigarette smoke, it makes dirty others, it is disgusting, cigarette smoke not only, injure of who smoke cigarettes by oneself but it still injure the innocent who them no gets into with these thing. "you think, it is fair already!, with who don't smoke but they must participate to are responsible in the behavior of who smokers. " People die of terrible diseases from breathing other people's smoke, and it is bad for health of who smokers, smoking cigarettes causes the disease various kinds, which, make the body is born the going back looks shabby, such as, the disease footpath system breathe, the cancer the lungs. Another reason, I hate at my clothes has the smell of cigarette smoke because it makes me feels to are not cheerful, and feel dirty, the reason that smoking cigarettes should prohibited in the restaurants, in important all place or even in the public place because of the battle stirs others which other person will may don't like stinking smell of cigarette smoke, make the annoyance other people, may have the revelation prohibits to have smoking cigarettes in the public place, and the place have a lot of people. Finally, The cigarettes is habit - forming drug and it is illegal in some places. I believe it will help to make smokers quit smoking. If, they persistently, the government should have the penalty provisions of a laws completely for who disobey, maybe the health warnings or maybe these new laws will help them stops.
