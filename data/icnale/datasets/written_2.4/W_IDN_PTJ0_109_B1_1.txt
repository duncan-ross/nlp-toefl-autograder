I, being employed with a part-time job, truly do believe that there is no wrong in having a part-time job while being a student. I honestly think that it is an awesome, great idea for students to have part-time jobs before they graduate from univercity, if they have the time and resources to do so. Students who are responsible, or learn responsibility, have nothing to loose but all to gain by having a job. A student that can maintain a part-time job gain excellent first-hand experience that cannot be gained from the classroom. In fact the experience they gain from the part time job will make them the right asset the company seeks to have as they not only have academic achievement but also the practical knowledge related to their academic knowledge. Therefore, experienced students applying for a job are more likely to be hired than someone who is not as experienced. This is because students with experience on their resume show that they have already proven they can handle a job while balancing study and other activities. Besides, they have also proved themselves that they are people who are ready to meet challenges, and are willing to work hard. Usually, these people are also people with more mature personality.
