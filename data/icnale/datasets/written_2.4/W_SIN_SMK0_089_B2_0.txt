I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, for the better health and comfort of its residents. Firstly, smoking at restaurants causes health problems for both the smoker and non-smokers in the vicinity. There is absolutely no right for smokers to endanger the lives of others who are unwilling to be harmed in that way, and it would be unreasonable to expect non-smokers to move away from the area. Some restaurants might have segregated sections for smokers and non-smokers, but this does not eliminate the smoke completely. Furthermore, these partitions result in fewer seats available to both smokers and non-smokers, reducing patron comfort. Secondly, not smoking at restaurants is an easily undertaken option. Smoking can be done outside of a restaurant, where it would not affect patrons as much. As the purpose of a restaurant is to mainly serve food and beverages in its premises, it would be unrealistic to suggest the converse --- in which non-smokers are asked to eat outside a restaurant. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country so as to reduce health problems and inconveniences to everyone, and it would not be much additional work for smokers to leave the premises to get their nicotine fix.
