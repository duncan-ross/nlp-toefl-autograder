According to statistical materials, the rate of people smoking tobacco is becoming increase more and more rapidly. Nowadays, we can easily find some signs of non-smoking area or stopping smoke in this area in many places such as school, company, restaurant and so on. Smoking is harmful to everyone. I strongly agree on this topic, that is, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the restaurants are the places where people can eat some meal. Someone make people feel unhappy as smoking in the restaurants. Since the smell of smoking is not a good, people cannot breathe well in there. Second, the tobacco is a harmful thing to our health. It is not good to anyone who smoking or not. The bad thing must be banned by law or anything. Third, there are smoking areas in the side of the restaurants with changing social perception only for smokers. This is a good way to avoid harm to non-smokers. In conclusion, I think that smokers are banned in the restaurants in the way smoking area. The smoking is not a good thing, so stopping is good for everyone. In looking at above three reasons, I strongly agree on this topic.
