Nowadays, most of university students in Hong Kong are having part-time job. It seems that have a part-time job is just a common thing and it is part of their university life. But, is it important for university students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, i am totally agree. To have a part-time job, we can achieve so many things that we cannot learn from the textbook. Such as communication skill, self-confidence and management skill. We can also earn some experience that we have ever meet before. Actually, experience is very important, not only in our future work but also in our whole life. Recently, there are a hot news topic is about a master graduated student cannot get a job successfully even he have already been graduated after three years. It seems ridiculous, but that is the truth. This news shows that he cannot get a job is due to his poor interview skill and no working experience. Therefore, working experience is so important for everyone, especially for the ridgepole and beams—the university students. So, It is important for university students to have a part-time job.
