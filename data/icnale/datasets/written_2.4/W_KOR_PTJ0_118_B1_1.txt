I think part-time job is very important in some students. Because they are very poor. So some students will have to pay expensive fees earned directly. For this reason, it is very important for campus students. If part-time job not, because they can't afford to pay the tuition fees. Other students that doing part-time job spend to buy clothes or to play with friends. Know the importance of money and can spend some free time more interesting. And while part-time jobs are also usually experience social advance. So I think it is important to campus students. But many people say'it does not important. 'They say, rather I get a scholarship to study and better.... Of course, if I can get scholarships, good grades, but it is not easy to do, and you can study while working part-time enough to think we can get a scholarship. Of course, I think a part-time job is to decide for you. And when they do not work part-time for any reason. They are also a part-time job is its own reason. Paying tuition, Savings money or buying clothes, etc. Because of these good things, I think you need a part-time college students are. So I agree on this topic.
