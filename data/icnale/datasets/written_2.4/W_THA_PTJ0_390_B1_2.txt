I somewhat agree with this. It's has both Pros and Cons to have a part time job. First I'll explain the good thing to have a part time job. I think most of student has problem about saving money. They earn limited money from their parents. So it's very necessary to have apart time job. It can help student in several case. 1. It can make students use their free time for advantage thing. When they finish class instead surfing the Internet, having a part time job. 2. It may help they learn new experience and skill of life for living in now and future. 3. It can make they are responsible and diligent. Second, having a part time job also has bad thing because some college student doesn't have enough time to have a part time job. They must study hard and do activities in their university and it is difficult and don't convenient to go to work because they don't have a car or motorcycle belong to themselves. Sometime some part-time job give salary unsuitable such as some part-time job may give a little salary despite student must work hard and maybe employer might threaten student and make them stress. but sometime student can have a part-time job if they have free time.
