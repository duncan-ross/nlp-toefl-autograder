I cheer on that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. I have three reasons to support my opinion. First, as everyone knows that smoking is harmful for people's health. It not only damages smoker's health, but also let smoker's families to have second- hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoke. If in the restaurants, of course, smokers will do harm to non-smokers when they smoke in there. So to protect the customers in the restaurants from being polluted, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. Second, restaurants are the places that people enjoy their meal and have a good family time. It is important to build a comfortable and healthy environment for people to eat in there. Many people feel very unhappy when they sit near to some people who smoke. But they cannot protest because smoking is not banned in the restaurants. They have to suffer and bear. Absolutely, smoking should not be allowed. Last, if smoking be banned at the restaurants, the smokers may know that it is annoying to smoke in the public places. They may change their habits to give up smoking. As a conclusion, smoking should be banned at the restaurants.
