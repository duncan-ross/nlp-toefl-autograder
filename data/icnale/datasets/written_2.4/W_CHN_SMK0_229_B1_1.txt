 Several months ago, some policies on smoking were introduced by the government to stop some people from smoking in the public. However, as far as I know, the conditions are almost still the same, and I hold the firm belief that smoking in the public should be banned. The first reason, as is known to all, is that smoking is very bad for our health, and it also does quite a lot of damage to the environment. If someone smokes in public, not only he himself, but also the people around are affected by the smoke. According to the research, the smoke will have a worse influence on the people around than the smoker, which is really surprising. It is known to all that smoking will cause diseases like lung cancer, heart disease and so on. Besides, the smoke also damage the environment and then we may feel uncomfortable. In my opinion, smoking almost has no advantage but all kinds of disadvantages. In addition, we may ignore the fact that smoking in public may also cause fire, and it is really important to prevent it. If the cigarette is on fire and it is thrown, then something may cause fire. The result is very dangerous and we really should do something to prevent it, stopping smoking is the most useful method. So in a word, smoking has no advantage but all kinds of disadvantages. It must be banned in the public and everyone of us should tell others not to smoke in public any more.
