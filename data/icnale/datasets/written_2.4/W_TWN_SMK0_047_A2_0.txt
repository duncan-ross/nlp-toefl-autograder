I agree this policy. When I was child my father likes smoke. But smoke let me so suffering, my noise is can't use. So I hate any smoker, they make the earth's air dirty. Taiwan has a new policy about smoking, I feel so happy. That mean I have clean and fresh air in some space. When I will eat delicious food in restaurant, I will feel comfortable. When I will go shopping in market or supermarket, I don't smell those tastes. So I very like this policy. The policy makes my father to give up smoking in public space and in our house. Smoking is make another man feel uncomfortable and may hurt own body. It means "more a loss than gain". Now I hope policeman can grab those men who want to smoking in public place. That can make our earth and air becomes clean and clean. If we have children, their health also becomes better than before. Because smoking is have very hard hurt to everyone and everyone's baby. I don't like smoking. I agree this policy can make our life beauty. So I agree this topics "smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country".
