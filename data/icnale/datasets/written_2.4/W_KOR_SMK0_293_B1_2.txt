Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? Anyone knows the smoking is harmful to many people. Smokers have freedom of smoking but those ranges should not affect to others. Especially in restaurant, I think that it has to be regulated in government level and should be banned. Restaurant is the place that provide the meal to people and they have a comfort time. Smoking injures these people's free time. They have to do not damage to others at least. Also, smoking in restaurant injures people's healthy. The place of eating food should not be the place of eating ashes! Making a smoking room apart from eating place is also excellent method. Then, the satisfaction will be grown up to many people. However, they leaves still many problems. Cigarette smoke, ashes, smell and so on is that. In conclusion, smoking is still harmful to many people. Smokers can do smoke wherever they don't affects to people but in the restaurant, they need to control. I think that smoking should be banned for the many in public place, especially in restaurant.
