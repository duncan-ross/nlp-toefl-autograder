 Having part-time jobs is a common phenomenon among college students nowadays. In my opinion, doing part-time jobs is a good way to live a meaningful life in the university. Doing part-time jobs can help us adapt to society earlier and lay the foundation of working after graduation. Besides, we can gain working experience and reduce the finance burden of our parents. We may strengthen our sense of responsibility and be stronger in the face of setbacks and know how to handle interpersonal relationships. There are also other benefits, such as improving social skills and our own quality and enrich our lives. Although it's meaningful for us to do part-time jobs, we cannot find part-time jobs blindly. When we find a part-time job, we need to take the time and our own interest into account. We should clearly recognize that we are still students now even though we have become adults. So we must do part-time jobs under the premise of ensuring our studies. Whether to find a part-time job and the number of jobs depend on our own situation. If you have enough time, doing part-time jobs is surely a better choice than playing computer games. If you have a part-time job, cherish the opportunity and enjoy yourself, you will benefit from it a lot.
