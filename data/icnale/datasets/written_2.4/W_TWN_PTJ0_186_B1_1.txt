I think that I've agree the part time job is important to college student, if you ask the other's people, I think you will get the same answer, too. Why do I have this conclusion? Let me explain why I have the idea. First, college student to do the part time job can learn something that can't learn in the school, likes specialty skills, social skills. In the society, you can't do the wrong as you can; you should be avoid the mistake when you're working. In the school, teacher or classmates can be endure your mistake, and give you some tips or suggestion. Second, it's not that everybody be rich, somebody does the part time job that is earning more money to lighten the parents burden, but if you're rich, you maybe not to be frugal because you don't know how making economical is very important. So doing a part time job can let you to know burden is being in need. Third, doing a part time job is useful to your job in future, in the modern society, experience is very important, if you don't have any experience, I think you wii be a hard way to find a job. Fourth, you can meet the different people in your part time store, it's develop your personal networks opportunity, I think it's very useful. Four points of the above, it's my point as issue, and it can hold my inference faultless.
