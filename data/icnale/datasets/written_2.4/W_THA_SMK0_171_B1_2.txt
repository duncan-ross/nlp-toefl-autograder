I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I was the one who ever smoked the cigarettes but now I quit them permanently. Smoking is very harmful to health but some people choose to do, though they knew the danger of it. I understand that the symptoms of people addicted to cigarette but they are not supposed to interfere with another customer in restaurant. In some restaurants that set at outdoor is acceptable to smoke at areas that far from people, but on the other hand in a restaurant with air condition the owner restaurant should be held smoking areas for smokers. Because the customers who do not smoke want to eat delicious food along with a good view and some people that allergic to smoke. I have opinion that the smokers should to reduce smoking and quit smoking in the finally because cigarettes did not have any benefit and they also make you and people around you got lung cancer. In conclusion, in truly the smokers should not smoke in the restaurant because restaurant is the place that people come to eat food but they should smoke in smoking areas that prepared for them.
