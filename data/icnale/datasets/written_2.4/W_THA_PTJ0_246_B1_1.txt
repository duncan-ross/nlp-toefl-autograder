Nowadays, there are many part-time jobs that college students can do them. Although, part-time job can help the finance of college students, but in my opinion, I think that it is not important for college students to have part-time job. There are many part-time jobs in our country. There are both good and not good part-time. However, the both of part-time jobs have disadvantages more that advantages to college students. There are two reasons that why part-time job is not important for college students. First, part-time jobs affect to student's study. Second, past-time jobs waste student's time to do homework. First, the part-time jobs affect to study of students. Part-time jobs can be the cause that make student cannot get good grade. For example, if students spend all their free time to work in their part-time jobs, they might feel so tried. When they have class, they may not go to their class. It can make they lose the knowledge that teacher teach in their class. Therefore, part-time jobs can affect to student's study. Second, past-time can waste student's time to do their homework. For example, students spend their free time to work in their part-time job. The time that they spend to do their work is their time that they should do their homework. If they spend all their time to work, they cannot have time to do their homework. It might affect to their grade.
