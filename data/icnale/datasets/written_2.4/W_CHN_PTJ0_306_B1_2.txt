 Today, many college students take their spare time to do some part-time jobs. In my opinion, part-time job can be allowed, but not necessary. There are many advantages of having a part-time job. For example, Wang, who is my senior school classmate, now is in JiLin university, has ever done a part-time job in a stationer. She is an out-going girl. Her parents are both civil servants, so her family is a rich family. She did the part-time job not for money but for experience. During that time, she was very familiar to each kind of pens and note-books. She knew clearly where they were and how much they were. She showed her patience to each consumer. She deeply experienced that working as an assistant is too difficult. She even knew that earning money is a difficult thing, too. Since then, she began to value each cent. This experience helped her understand too many things that she couldn't get from books or classes. Besides, having a part-time job also can lighten our parents' burden. Maybe we just can earn a little wage, but using the money earned by our own is a wonderful thing. Every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages of doing a part-time job. First, if the part-time job takes up your much time, you may have no time to do other things such as doing sports. Then, during our age, the most important thing is to learn knowledge as much as possible. And, doing part-time jobs may cause some security problems. In a word, if we do part-time jobs, we can make progress in a way. But part-time jobs are not necessary, we can do them later, it doesn't matter.
