Does the cigarette give us some vitamin or protein like food? If I ask this question in the restaurant that I saw somebody is smoking, I might get some kick from that person. I agree that the smoking should be banned from the restaurant. Today, there are many smoky people such as pup, bar, restaurant even the daily life. We could not stop them to smoke at the public place. For example, sometimes, when we go to the restaurant to have a good meal or wonderful dinner with your special occasion. The waiter ask you that do you want smoking or none smoking area. I am the one who use to meet the situation like this. I tell that I would like no smoking area but I found the fact that the both of areas are very near to each other. So why do I have to choose because I still smell of cigarettes. I feel so bad with the atmosphere. They should separate the area of no smoking area and smoking area very far from each other. So, people who choose no smoking will not smell of any cigarettes anymore. In the restaurant, I think it should ban smoking because it is very public. So we do not have to separate the area of smoking but I think it should be abolished. If there are people who would like to smoke so we should prepare a place outside the restaurant for them.
