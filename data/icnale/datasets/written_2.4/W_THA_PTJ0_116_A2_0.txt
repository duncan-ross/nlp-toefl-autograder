From the topic, I do agree about doing part-time because having job is the training gives a student has the tolerance and have the effort in making money and expenses saving of a guardian are light responsibility distribution of a family have of a student with and with regard to a student work the overtime study. It make a student knows can socialize different outside easy had made to adjust oneself with the condition at that time fast more than a person who not the experience in the sense of this comes to and the work make a student know to take time free to the advantage and make to know the worth of money more and more and know school hours administration vacate the office hours suit the business condemn of oneself well go up and on the other hand. If we work and make money by oneself and make us know the worth of money more and more and scratch will the care pay attention to others and know the work that us never to meet and meet the thing that us never to see and student source majority will work that are source student from provincial mostly.
