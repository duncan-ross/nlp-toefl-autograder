Agree because I think a part-time job of students is a make students learn to spend money for save a money. The part-time job is a good for students and students should do a work but the work must not make bad grades. Students must know the time to share learning and working part time so that we can be happy for both learning and working. The part-time job is to earn money from their students will have seen the value of money, extravagant spending and help the family. Sometimes students want to work part-time experience for their expertise or experience to be real good recruiting only from experience. For some students who want to earn money during school space to use for living. I would agree that students need to earn money by working a part-time job. But A part-time job must is a work Honest no violence or other immoral. Parents gave consent and awareness in the students do and do not result in learning to drop grades. When students want to earn money by working part-time job will do studies that are most important in the life of a student for the best for the future good of the Thai students is to working a past time job while studying.
