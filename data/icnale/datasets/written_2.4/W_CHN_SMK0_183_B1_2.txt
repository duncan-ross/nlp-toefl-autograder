When we go to a restaurant we often see some people smoke. Sometimes we don't say anything. The persons who smoke in the restaurant they say that they are bored when they wait for the meals; they need to smoke to amuse themselves. But other people hate it; it will be bad for their healthy. In my view, people should not smoke in the restaurant. As we all know, when some people smoke in the restaurant, it will cause much terrible smell. Then other people eat in the restaurant, they will cough, what's worse, it is bad for others health. All of us know that second-hand smoke is much worse than people smoke directly. And when people smoke, other people can't eat well. People have a meal on a table; the others can persuade them who smoke. Many people want to have a smokeless restaurant. We can't say that they have bad quality. Because they haven't realized it was in the danger other's health, still do not have quality said. In my opinion, people should pay attention to others feel and health. I think the restaurant can launch smoke-free policies. They can persuade them not to smoke. If they see someone smoke in the restaurant, they can stop them. For everyone's health, don't smoke in restaurants.
