Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health, a popular phrase exploited in almost every part of the world. But does it really mean anything to people, especially to smokers? Everybody knows that smoking is a serious cause of disease and in extreme cases, death. That is why I wonder why people still gets lured and committed to it. There are many to be put up as a reason for it but most probably, the implementation of a banning law is lacking. Since we consider nicotine as being addicting, why not forbid it? There is no good out of it, so why maintain it? It'll be a difficult process to actually extinguish cigarettes but in a long run, it would benefit us in the highest essence. Therefore, starting on a small scale would be advisable. Forbidding cigarettes from places where people tend to hang out like restaurants, is a great way to head start it. Some people would always be irritated with others smoking their lungs out as they do their own business in certain establishments. So if the cigarette ban would start in public places such as cafés and restaurants, it would help both the smokers and the non-smokers. As time will pass, and as a bigger scale would be tackled by this banning law, more problems, specially of health would be resolved.
