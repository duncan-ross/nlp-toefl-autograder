I agree totally with this statement, as I believe that the society will benefit from this movement if it is implemented. It has already been widely recognised that smoking, both direct and second-hand, has dire effects on an individual's health. Such impacts will also result in high social cost for the society in general in the forms of lower productivity and less healthy populations with higher incidences of lungs-related diseases, which will then warrant higher need and urgency to divert national budgets towards healthcare treatment from other equally important sectors like education and nation building. The urgency for its implementation is especially emphasized in the context of the restaurants, where family outings are usually conducted. Children are widely known to have a weaker immune system, and hence are more susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking. Yet given the addictive nature of smoking, I do not deny the possibility that this movement might face some objections from the smokers themselves. However, I still opine that Singapore will only benefit from the banning of smoking in its ground in the long term as smoking is too much a negative externalities to its economy and society as large. Moreover, quitting smoking will also improve the lifestyles and health of its population which can then free up extra resources for other important sectors in Singapore that we would like to develop on. No doubt this will be a long-term measure, but restaurants are a good starting point for this movement.
