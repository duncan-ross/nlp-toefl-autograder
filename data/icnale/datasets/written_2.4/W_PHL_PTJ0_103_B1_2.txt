What makes an independent college student? Does one need to have his own condominium unit? Or possibly, one needs to be able to support his or her needs? For me, it is highly important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job gives college students, like me, a sneak peak to the world that we will possibly live in the future. One of the reasons as to why we need to know what we will face is so that we will be ready. Aside from that, it will also help us earn money in our own. Having a college student take a part-time job may be worrisome for the parents, but surely, it will help them greatly in the long run. There are several advantages in having a part-time job. First edge that it will give is that one will be able to earn money. Aside from earning money, one will learn the hardships that one has to face in order to achieve it. This idea will help one to be stronger as a person and to be more determined in making one's dream a success. The money you will earn will also help one in their studies. In time when a student needs to buy books and other references, you will not need to bother your parents for money since one will have the means to buy it himself. Truly, part-time job will not only help one physically but also mentally. Looking at all the advantages part-time job gives really makes one wonder, Why do I not have a part-time job? As my teacher taught me before, One learns the best through experience.
