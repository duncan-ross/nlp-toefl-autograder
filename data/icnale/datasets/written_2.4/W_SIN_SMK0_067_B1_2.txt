I disagree with this statement. While the harms of smoking and passive smoking are widely known, I believe that ultimately, smoking is still an individual's right. Just as how an individual has the freedom of speech, thought, conscience and religion, I believe that smoking is a personal lifestyle choice. At times, one's speech, thought, and religion may seemingly offend others, yet we do not see the government imposing a ban on that. For example, Christians are legally allowed to evangelize on the streets of most countries, though some members of the community find that terribly insulting to their own religious faiths and beliefs. In the same way, smoking should thus be allowed even though it may cause harm to others in the form of passive smoking, because I think that one's right should not be infringed just for the sake of another's. That being said, the harms of passive smoking is real and should be avoided, if necessary. After all, it is unfair that the public has to be subjected to taking in smoke passively and having their health negatively affected, just because of those who smoke. However, this does not have to be done through a complete ban of smoking in restaurants. At present, there are many restaurants who have non-smoking and smoking areas for the respective groups of people. I feel that this is sufficient to prevent passive smoking and the best way to please both parties. Hence, a complete ban is unnecessary and will only cause an uproar among smokers at best.
