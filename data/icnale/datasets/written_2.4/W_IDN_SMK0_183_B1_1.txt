I quite agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. However, this is very complicated because in general, Indonesian people are people who really do not discipline against a regulation, especially laws that they think are not important and interfere with their comfort. This used to be very regrettable because I saw a lot in public places is primarily Restaurant banned smoking even though it is already marked but the smokers still smoke in the venue. This is of course very disturbing, especially for consumers who do not smoke in the restaurant - others, especially women and children. And if the smokers are in general warned they would be offended and angry. One which I think is very funny and absurd. We will not be able to become a great nation if the people manage discipline alone cannot. I see the efforts were good enough to provide a place for smokers and banning smoking in public places, but it will not work if no strong action for the perpetrators. So I think for every restaurant should provide special places for smokers with a short distance with other consumers who do not smoke. This is for maintaining the health and future of society itself.
