I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons. First, through a part-time job we can know things that we need in society. To do it makes me know how to come in contact with people, who are higher position than me, the way to speak correct words and store's management and so on. And to do it makes us develop. For example, if you have a part-time job in restaurants you may be able to learn a way to cooking deliciously and if you have a part-time job in stores that buys many trendy clothes you may be able to learn a way to fold clothes beautifully. Some people who don't experience it, when they get a job, may be very nervous, not find what to do and be useless at all. Secondly, to have a part-time job helps us come true our dreams and what we want to do. I belong to ice hockey club. Playing ice hockey costs much money to buy some protectors and pay club cost. To continue belonging to ice hockey club we must have a part-time job. And people who want to be musician could have to have also a part-time job to buy very expensive guitar. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
