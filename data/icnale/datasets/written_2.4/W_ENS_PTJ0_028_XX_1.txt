If we can take part-time jobs to be internships, I think that they are a varied necessary and important part of the college experience. I major in engineering, and for me, it will be almost impossible to get a good job when I finish my degree if I do not have some previous work experience. For other students with technical majors, I think the case is similar, and they should find some way to incorporate part-time work into their curriculum because it will definitely improve their prospects of employment when they go about seeking a full time position. However, I don't think that a student should waste their time doing part-time work at restaurants or other places where the experience they gain is not applicable to their overall goals. This is just a quick way to make money and a way to kill time, and students are doing themselves a disservice by engaging in this kind of activity. Continuing along this line of thought also reveals that the students who take part time jobs at restaurants and other places may suffer the unfortunate fate of having to work there much longer than they want to, whereas students who pursue different kinds of employment are putting themselves in a position to develop their careers.
