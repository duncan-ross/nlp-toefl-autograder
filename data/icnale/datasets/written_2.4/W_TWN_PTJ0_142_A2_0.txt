When students just entered college, it would be a great different way to study from before. Life of college is free; students had much time to do anything they want. But studying in college is expensive, and students were at least 18 years old, who were able to earn money to afford their spends. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job is not only earning money, but also learning! You can learn experiences like talking skills talent for leading, and gaining your body more strength when you are working, even you can make friends ! I was working for a gas station for my first part-time job, it seemed like a quite easy job, but it was not. You had to learn not only fill oil in cars, but also wash cars use POS system help any problems for customers, and repair any equipments in the station. Worth of all, I learned speaking skills from talking with customers and my officer, it is the most help by this job. Now, I am in my third year of college, students who is third grade in my college should go company for a part-time job, and I will get more experiences to benefit me in this chance.
