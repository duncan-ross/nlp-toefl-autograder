I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I'll show a reason which supports my opinion. First of all, the most important thing for college students is studying. If we have a part-time job, we will learn a lot from the experience, too. However, I think we must spend most time on studying. If we study earnestly, we hardly have spare time to work part-time. Most college students who have a part-time job work in order not to gain experience by practice for their future plans or to earn fees of school but to earn money for their interest such as drinking, buying clothes, play, and so on. I think that there is something lazy about them. They probably think that they will be able to graduate from college as long as they study averagely. They enjoy their life style now, however, once they go to a graduate school or start to work after graduation they realize they should have spent their energy on studying more and spent more meaningful time in college. College students should make a great effort at studying for own future. This is why I disagree with this statement.
