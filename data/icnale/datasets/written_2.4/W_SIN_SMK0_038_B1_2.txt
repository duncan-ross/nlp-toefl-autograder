I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, at least not in the short term. I believe that all of us are aware of the dire consequences of smoking- that we are not only smoking our way into poverty but also into the grave. However, people do not smoke as a habit simply because they want to. Smoking is a chemical addiction- all smokers may have said yes to smoking once, but subsequent rounds of smoking are largely due to helplessness, which most smokers need time to overcome. To ban smoking at all restaurants completely will demonstrate our extreme unwillingness to give smokers the time that they need to overcome their addiction by out-casting them, and that will be too extreme, because strength requires a huge amount of acceptance and time to cultivate. I recognize though, the many health concerns that come with passive smoking in itself, let alone passive smoking while eating. Most of us are unwilling to expose ourselves to unnecessary health risks. Therefore, smokers should be encouraged to wean their reliance off smoking gradually- and restaurants should aid smokers by phasing out the idea of "smoking" areas gradually, not immediately, and they can do so simply by decreasing the size of smoking areas overtime. Smoking is thought to be an act of unnecessary public nuisance, but banning smoking at all restaurants does not solve the problem- to stop allowing the sale of cigarettes will strengthen smokers will to wean themselves off smoking. The day when cigarettes cease to exist will be the day restaurants can effectively "get rid" of smokers anyway.
