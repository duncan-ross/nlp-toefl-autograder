Balancing school and work is the hardest job a part-time worker college student has to face everyday. It may be ridiculous for some that a college student will go to work after school but for some, everything depends on these part-time jobs. Truthfully, the world is becoming inhuman. Putting money first before human lives is becoming typical. The same goes for college students working their lives off while studying at the same time. They spend 4-6 hours after school in their own respective part-time jobs. It is a common trend in today's world. To achieve a decent life and a prosperous future, one should acquire a suitable amount of money for a good education. Making money while in college is ideal for students. It becomes a priority for most students to get a part-time job to support their own studies. A working student drains the energy allotted for studying at work and sadly, not all companies or business establishments give considerations for these unfortunate students. Examples of these considerations are giving a flexible schedule and/or awarding a good salary for working students. If administered properly, part-time jobs can be an advantage for college students. It is all about the experience of working even before graduating. Some employers would love to hire fresh graduates who undergo deeper job training through part-time jobs in their college years. There is also a possibility that part-time jobs can also help college students in maintaining a healthy social life even under the heavy pressure of their studies through having both college friends and co-workers. A part-time job plays an important role to most college students nowadays. Even though some may not be in need of money, it is an essential experience that is worth all the hardships. It all depends on the student handling it.
