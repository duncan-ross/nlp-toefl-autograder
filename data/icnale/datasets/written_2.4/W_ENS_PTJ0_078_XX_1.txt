I don't think that is important for college students to have a part-time job. Our main goal as students is to graduate with a degree that will help us in securing a great job and a great financial future. Part-time work is simply a distraction from school, and parents should try to encourage their kids to become more responsible and more knowledgeable about money management by taking some business classes, and not pressure them into doing something that will cut into their other important activities like sleeping or social interaction. Unfortunately, many parents and many employers do not feel this way, so it is difficult to reconcile this with my opinion above. Although I do not personally think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, the majority of the business world and other individuals do think so, and therefore I might have to say that I have rethought my answer on this subject. Just because I myself don't think that is important for college students to have a part-time job, the fact that many others do actually make it so that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Please excuse my flip flopping on the situation.
