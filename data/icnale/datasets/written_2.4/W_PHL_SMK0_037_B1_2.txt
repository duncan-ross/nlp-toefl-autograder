The sentence 'Cigarette smoking is dangerous for the health ' has been told to everyone. It has been spread out using cigarette packs, commercials and posters, yet people still continue to do the act of smoking. Also, although scientists have proven that cigarettes contain tar, nicotine and other substances which make smokers addicted to them which in return cause lung cancer and other sicknesses, people still continue to smoke. People usually smoke in open areas, but there are also some who smoke inside enclosed areas such as restaurants. Despite the 'No Smoking ' signs inside restaurants, some smokers still smoke within the vicinity; they ignore the signs even though the signs were specifically put up to prohibit smokers from smoking inside the restaurant, especially when there are other customers eating their meals. I have once experienced eating inside a restaurant when a group of customers started smoking in front of the air conditioner. Never liking smokers, I was not only furious at the group of customers, but also at the manager and staff of the restaurant. I was infuriated at the group of customers because they were sitting in front on the 'No Smoking ' sign, yet they did not only choose to overlook the sign, but they also chose to disregard the emotions of other customers. As for the manager and staff, I was exasperated at them for they could have told the group to immediately stop smoking because the group was polluting the air while most were still eating and by their nonchalance of the group's decision to disregard the clear sign. To sum up, I believe that smoking should be prohibited inside restaurants, because the smoke does not only pollute the air which dirties the food, but it also causes lung cancers for smokers and inhalers of second hand smoke.
