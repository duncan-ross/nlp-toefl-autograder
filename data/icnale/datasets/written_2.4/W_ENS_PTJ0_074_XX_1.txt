One of the things that many colleges do not stress enough is the importance of part-time work for students. Personally, my college does a great job of doing this and we are encouraged to work part-time, and many companies around the school have affiliations with the school so that they can offer opportunities for students to work part-time. This gives the students a chance to gain valuable work experience while the same time making some spending money and learning about the structure of businesses. It is well known that students who graduate from college with work experience will be more able to find a good position than are students who did not, and depending on the goals of the individual student, he or she will need to judge if part-time work will fit in well for their future goals. If a student is planning on going to a master's program or PHD, he or she might be better off focusing on studying so that they get good grades, but even they will need to eventually have a part-time job in order to learn how to work in the real world. Students who are planning on finding employment after their undergraduate education should find part-time employment sooner because they will need to find a fulltime job sooner as well.
