Nowadays more and more college students go out to have a part-time job in the society. I think it is a good sign. First, we can take some money from a part-time job, which can reduce the family burden. It is uneasy for our parents to raise us and now it's time for us to do something to let our parents relaxed. Second, it is a good chance to get to know society. We can learn something that we can't learn in college. It will be helpful for our future work. At the same time, we can find out which job we are interested in and are really good at. Last, we can meet more people. Some of them may become our good friends. In the last summer holiday, I became a private teacher. I taught math and English to a student in high school. I learn how to communicate with her better and learn some English that I didn't study well when I was in high school. After the teaching, my student becomes my good friend. she is younger than me and her thought is different with me and my former friends. I learn many thing from my student. Because of the teaching, I felt very substantial in the holiday. Through this experience, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
