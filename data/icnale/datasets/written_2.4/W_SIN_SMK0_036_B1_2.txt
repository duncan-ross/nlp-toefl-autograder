I disagree that smoking should be banned on all restaurants. I acknowledge the fact that smoking is not good for health and harms the smoker and the people around the smoker. In the long run, one can get lung cancer or adverse health conditions. To start off with, there are many people in the country that are smokers and are pretty much hooked on smoking. Should a ban be placed on all restaurants in the country, this will cause the smokers to feel offended and there could be protests and a lot of controversial talk about it. Eventually, the government would still have to give way, which is why they came up with the yellow box area whereby smokers are allowed to smoke. From a business standpoint, they should be allowed to decide for themselves what kind of business mix they would like to attract. Also, if the general public doesn't like it, they are able to decide for themselves whether they wish to dine with such a restaurant which allows smoking. Also, if smoking was such a huge issue that it should be banned in all restaurants, shouldn't it be banned in public? Or in a more extreme case, the entire country? The main reason behind why smoking should be banned should be considered before making any decisions. Either way, the non smokers or the smokers would get upset and at the end of the day, the government has to try their best to appease both sides.
