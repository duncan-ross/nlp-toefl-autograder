 We may often see the sign of no smoking in public. Most people fully applause for the decision. Some heavy smokers, however, can hardly control themselves sometimes and consider it impersonality to neglect their requirements. In fact, personally, I think it is quite proper to forbid smoking in public. First of all, inevitably, smoking in public disturbs others and harms the health of others by breathing in smoke. Moreover, cigarettes ends littered randomly onto the ground destroy the beautiful scenery and may easily damp the mood of tourists. Thus, always remind yourself to pay more attention to other people's feelings and try your best to be a polite person to accept and respect others' likes and dislikes. To say the least, it is widely acknowledged that smoking is a form of self-abuse which leads to many serious diseases like pneumonia or even lung cancer. Cigarettes not only stripped the rights of having fresh air, but also destroy the happiness of a family and even damage social harmony. All the harms listing above strengthened my faith in banning on cigarettes. I have a dream that one day the whole society becomes no-smoking zone and let the flower of harmonious blossom all over our society.
