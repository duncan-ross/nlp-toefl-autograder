It is important for college students to have a part time job. Agree, if they know how to manage their self and time. By having part time job will help them to build their responsibility with what they do, also will give them more confidence and experience. Because in the real world now, having the university degree won't guarantee you will get a good job and good living. So when the college students want to start early to learn about the job world or business world it's a good idea. Because as soon they can start, they can get more experience and opportunity to learn more in their young life and later on when they must face the real business world they will know or at least they know what to do and read the situation. Only the problem is they can handle it or not! Having a job is a more serious topic, when we have job means we must be more responsible. Because with job, we will have interaction directly or practically go in business world. Why we must be responsible?? Because in business world we must deal and face to the real financial case and if we screwed up, we must be responsible with what we did.
