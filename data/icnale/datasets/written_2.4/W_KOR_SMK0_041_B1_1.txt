I think Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is hazardous for human's life. But some of smokers are smoking in restaurant and damage for non smokers Usually outside of building or restaurant, smoking is not much uncomfortable for other people. But in the restaurant, smoking is very uncomfortable for non smokers. That's because of the cigarette smoke and ash. These are poisonous for people And non smoker's appetite will be decreases. Of this reason some restaurant made a smoking area and smoking only inside Smoking area and people smoking in that area Smoking area is intended for minimize damage for non smokers. It is made by glass and split two spares in restaurant. But smoking area can't proof all of non smokers. Cigarette smoke and ash is poisonous for people. Even smokers are smoke in smoking area. Cigarette smoke and ash are Not perfectly proofed for non smokers. The non smokers are forced to smoke because of these reasons Smoking area will be phase out and smokers must be smoking outside of restaurant But best way of restaurant smoke is quit the smoke. It is good for health and other peoples. Quit the smoke
