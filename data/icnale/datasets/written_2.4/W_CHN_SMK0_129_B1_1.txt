It is generally acknowledged that smoking harms not only people who smoke but also those who around the smoker. So it causes a social problem about whether smoking should be banned in the public places. For example, now we want to talk about whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There is no doubt that we only have a Yes answer. Though it is hard to carry it out, we have innumerous reasons to support this action. First of all, health comes first. Every day restaurants are full of all kinds of people. For example, if there are smokers in the restaurant, considering that there is no fresh air, the smoke will harm everyone here. If a man who never smokes goes to restaurants, it equals that he is forced to smoke every day. Besides, assuming a woman who has a baby in the restaurant, the health of the baby will be greatly affected. Then the illnesses caused by smoking will become more and the rate of death will rise. It is obvious that the average of lifetime will fall down. As it happens like this, where stands a healthy person in the earth? That is terrible!For the health of all the human beings, we really should take some measures. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Then our life must be better.
