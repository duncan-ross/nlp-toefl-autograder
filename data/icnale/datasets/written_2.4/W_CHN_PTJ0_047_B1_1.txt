We always read some news that talk about the modern college students' lives. According to this news, we find more and more college students prefer to have part-time job. Personally, I disagree with the opinion that having a part-time job is important. Nowadays the more colleges appear, the more college students appear. Firstly, we'll see more students who aren't rich enough to live in the city have appeared and have no choice but only to find a part-time job to support their living or studying. Obviously, most of us have no need to do that. Secondly, maybe we do not have more money to buy some clothe or other things, but unnecessary to worry about we can't continue our studying or normal living. Thirdly, for us, the most important thing is studying. After we've finished our works, then can we choose whether to have a part-time job or not in spare time? I agree with having an experience of part-time job is better for us to fit the society, but disagree with having the job can instead of having a class. Students dream one day they will be a rich man, such as Bill Gates, without graduated-degree can also earn money. Actually, only few of us can success. Most people still need to study and work hard to have a better life. We should realize our duties are studying not spend all the time on exercising living ability. In the words, I don't think college students have a part-time job is important.
