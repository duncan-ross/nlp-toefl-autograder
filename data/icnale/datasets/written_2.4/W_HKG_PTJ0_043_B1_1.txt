I agree with the statement a lot. It is because it provides an opportunity for university students to prepare themselves for the future. Some may argue that part-time job can only earn money with no other meaningful experience. Thus, it is useless. However, I see it in a different way. Todays, university students get lots of problem. For instance, they waste lot of time in playing with others. It is particularly serious for those living in residential hall. They won't put an emphasis on their study. For their academic study, they just simply ask friends for homework solution and study courses with as little workload as possible. The main reason behind it is that they lack their aim in studying in university and also the aim for the future. That is why I agree with the statement as I believe that having a part-time job is helpful to their personal development. The first thing they can learn is time management. If they get a part-time job, they have to plan how to spend their time efficiently. In this way, they can also learn how to take responsibility. And what I think is essential to them is that they can have a chance to think for themselves. With different category of part-time jobs, they can think about which one is suitable and what they are interested in. They may therefore start to prepare their career plan. And it is what university student should do. To conclude, apart from gaining academic knowledge in university, university students should also find way to improve their personality and social skills. And I think getting a part-time job can be a choice.
