I have a dad and he always smoking after he finished his breakfast, his lunch, his dinner. Not only after his eating, but also when I walk around with them (my family). And I really do not like a people who like smoking. I do not smoking, because my mom told me that smoking just broken your body, it was bad for me, cause at home I always whiff my father's cigarette same at my college. Many student at my college have a cigarette, and when I connect wi-fi at the ground floor they whiff their cigarette. What can I doing? I just sit and play music from my notebook and absolutely start to collect information from the internet. Cigarette is number one industry that made money in Indonesia, many people in Indonesia like cigarette, their mind is like full of'cigarette', after they do something, they always 'turn on' their cigarette. If we banned them at all the restaurant in Indonesia, I think they will be protest to the owner of the restaurant. But there is still a restaurant in Indonesia that from the beginning banned their customer to not smoking when they are eating in that restaurant.
