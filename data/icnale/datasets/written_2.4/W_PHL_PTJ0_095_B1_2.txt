College students should become creative and responsible with themselves. They must know what is good or bad and must learn not to depend on their parents always. As a college student, I know that part-time job is an important way of helping parents. Even though I am not a working student I can really say that it is very big helping to every student especially those who have financial problems. They are learning how to be independent and more responsible to their selves. I admire those students because they are very responsible of managing their time for their school and for their work. But aside of a big help to the student and to the family, there are also an effect to the student. He/she might encounter some problems to his/her study. Yes it is good that you can to your parents but if you know they can support your financial needs maybe it is advisable if you just focus on your study and not to work for yourself. At the first place it is the responsibility of your parents to send you on the school. But if there are financial problems to your family, then it is the right time for you to become a working student. I know it is hard to become a working a student and it is not bad because sometimes it is a measurement on how a student become more responsible to their selves. I salute every working student because they are a good example and a good role model to the youth.
