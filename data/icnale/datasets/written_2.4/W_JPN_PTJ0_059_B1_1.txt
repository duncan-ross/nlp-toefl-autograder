I agree with having part-time jobs. I have two reasons. First of all, college students are not only students but also adults. Some years later they will get jobs and start working in companies. Before this, they need to experience part-time jobs and understand how hard making money is. They also need to learn a lot of things through part-time jobs. Failing is a good experience. They will find the best way to solve the problem from it. Second, there are many kinds of part-time jobs. I think college students had better experience some different kinds of part-time jobs as possible as they can. They can notice that they are really interested in a certain kind of job and it will help them decide their own jobs in the future. In addition, that experience will be useful for their life some day. It is true that part-time jobs sometimes prevent college students studying subjects in classes. However, part-time jobs teach them much more important things than subjects. They can get ability of communication and patience by working in part-time jobs. College students will glow as a member of society. Because of these reasons, I think that college students should have part-time jobs.
