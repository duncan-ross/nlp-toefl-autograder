There are many reasons as to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. From an economist perspective, smoking causes more harm to the society than to an individual because of the effect of second-hand smoking. More often than not, smokers often cause collateral damage in a sense that when they smoke, others unintentionally inhale the smoke. Second-hand smoking has been proven on many occasions through research to be more devastating to a person's health than actual smoking itself. This can more than substantiate the reason for banning smoking in public areas such as restaurants. On the other hand, banning smoking in restaurants can be harmful towards many restaurant businesses. Since restaurants are targeted at the more affluent crowd, who consists of a significant proportion of working class men who partake in smoking cigars as a social activity, banning smoking from restaurants might see a significant drop in customers. However, it can be argued that the extent of this effect is minimal. Of late, with aggressive campaigning against smoking in many countries, more people are quitting and less people are picking up this habit. Also, by banning smoking, it may attract more families to patronize such restaurants since they will be perceived as more family-oriented because of the restaurants' smoke-free policy. Thus, in conclusion the benefits of banning smoking in all countries far outweigh its disadvantages.
