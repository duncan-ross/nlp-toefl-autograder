In universities, we can easily find a fact that many students are willing to find part-time jobs to get more money so that they can pay some parts of their tuition. As this tendency is becoming more and more common, many people have expressed their views, such as support, disagreement or suspicion. As a college student, I also have a part-time job in a shop. In my opinion, it is really a good way to develop our ability so as to understand the world we live in. When we are free, a part-time job will certainly make our life colorful and meaningful, and that's why I enjoy it very much. Many people think it useless and harmful, because they don't believe the part-time jobs can give students any experience or help, and they also believe strongly it will influence our study and grades. But I want to say if we stay at home all day, we will never know what the real society is, and if we only focus our attention on marks, we will certainly be abandoned by this world. We are not the kids anymore, and this society requires us to gain something from practice so that we can easily adapt to it when we get close to it one day. To tell the truth, although the money we can earn when we join a part-time job is not pretty satisfied, it doesn't matter. Maybe we should know that the more failure and pain we experience, the more close the success is approaching to you. This is my own view on part-time job, and I wish more and more college students can get happiness and success from this wonderful way!
