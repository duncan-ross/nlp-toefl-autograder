I agree if the college students have a part time job as long as does not interfere his study. Part time job has some deficiency and advantage but in my opinion, the deficiency can be minimized. lack of part time job is to reduce time off and study. If we are good at managing time, we must continue to learn and rest well or we can choose work time that do not disrupt our learning time. So this way it can overcome shortage. While the advantage is to make us independent, can help our parents, and gain work experience. You would be proud if it can help parents to finance your college with your own hard work, even your parents must be very proud too if you had a good achievement in college. You will also get work experience before graduating from college. Experience is the most valuable teacher. After graduating from college, you will surely find a suitable job with our majors of college. Experience we gained while part time job can be utilized when working after graduating from college. especially if your part time job is work in companies with good positions, certainly is very profitable. So when you graduate in college, you no longer need to bother looking for another job again.
