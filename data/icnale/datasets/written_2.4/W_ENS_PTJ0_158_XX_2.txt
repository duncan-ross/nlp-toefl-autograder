I agree. I realize that a lot of people will disagree with me, but I feel that students who have part-time jobs usually work better with their degree studies. Perhaps it is because they are normally more organized than some of their mates or they have just gotten into sound routines when it comes to balancing work with study. Some just couldn't be bothered working anyway, because they just want to cruise through their degrees and have parties every day. Nothing wrong with that, if they pass, but I think the ones that I have seen who are also working, seem to take their studies more seriously and dread the thought that they might even fail one subject. I am not saying that this is true for all students, it is just my opinion based on the comparisons that I have made between different categories of students who I happen to know personally. Another thing that struck me was that there course averages seemed to be slightly higher not for any one particular subject but generally speaking over the course of their degrees. I also think that for a lot of students these days, they understand what is happening in the world, the economy, the job market and they know that if the want to get anywhere in life, they are going to have to work for it.
