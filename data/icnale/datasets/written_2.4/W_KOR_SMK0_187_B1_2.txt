Smoking is somewhat very controversial issue in the modern society. There are people who claim that smoking in the public places must be banned by the law and who claim that habits like smoking should not be limited by the law because it is violating people's individual right. They argue whether it is a freedom of people or a habit that harms lots of "innocent" people; non- smokers. What I think is that smoking is not banned by the law at the first place. It shoulder be perfectly a decision that people make by themselves whiter they smoke or not. However, since indirect smoking is known as very harmful to people and there are people who cannot even handle the specific smell of cigarette and tobacco, the smokers should aware these facts and respect these non-smokers. Shortly, as well as non-smokers respect them and let them smoke wherever and whenever, the smokers also must respect the non-smokers, because even though smoking is allowed by the law, their choice to harm their body can also harm other people who do not choose to harm themselves. Habits like smoking should be respected and laws are not to violate any individual rights as loon as these habits are not to affect other people.
