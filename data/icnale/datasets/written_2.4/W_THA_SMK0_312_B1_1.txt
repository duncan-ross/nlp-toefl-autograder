Smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country because It is not only have bad effect to smokers but also the people beside them too. I know, smokers know that smoking is not good and lead to Lung's cancer and other disease but they still smoking up and up. When I go to restaurant and smell smoke, I feel bad about smokers that they don't know where is the place can smoke and cannot smoke. Frankly, I want to walk to them and ask them for stop smoking in the restaurant but it is not easy because they may be out-understanding and blame me that it is none of my business. Some family go to restaurant for eating and spend happy moment time together but they have lost happy moment time if in the restaurant they go, has a smoker is smoking. In addition, the children that they smell smoke directly by their family smoke, poor them so much. Some restaurants manage this problem by find out a place for smoking especially, I think it is good quite because where the restaurants have a good manage like this, the customer must choose that restaurant surely if they want to happy in eating and talking together.
