I agree with in this sentence because smoking is bad for health. It makes our health are unhealthy, if we smoke our smell it. In the others public shouldn't have smoking because it makes a bad air and dangerous for children and woman. In at all restaurants is the place of important to have many people, so its doesn't has smoking. All restaurants have to ban people for smoking because the restaurants have many food and people are eating food in there. They are smoking in the public make other people are unhealthy. In the other hands, we may be make a place for smoking to far the people. Moreover, the park, the theater, the mall the hospital, the school and the place to have many people. We are protected and treat children to far from smoking. We should use the time have the most useful, especially exercise, singing, reading, travel, listening to music, do homework, do activities etc. if we don't smoking, we will have a healthy is better. We don't make other people trouble, the air is a fresh and people are relaxed. If people smoking least, everything are happy, everyone are happy too. And everywhere are nice place.
