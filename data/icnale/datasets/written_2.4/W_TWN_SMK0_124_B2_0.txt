I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is important for people who smoke should follow the rule. Researches have shown that the tobacco smoke harm people around the smoke people than people who smoke. So I really do agree this. I think restaurants should set an area where people can smoke. This action has been practiced in some restaurants in Taiwan and it has good reflections to many people who don't smoke. If we could have a meal without the smell of smoke, we would have a more pleasant and healthy time during the meal time. But it would be a bad news for those who take smoking for their life. They would become upset and don't have any energy to resume their work. The best solution is to set an area near the restaurant for them to do the smoke thing. Maybe a room, an area out of the restaurant. I think we should learn to make a environment which is good for everyone. And this need all of us to create. I hope that we could live in a country which is non-smoking at all the restaurants in the near future.
