"Why don't we ban smoking at all restaurant?" This statement is the most asked question which is raised by HongKongers and revealed in a recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong Government last year. True, smoking brings about a great death toll and causes suffer on those who smoke and do not smoke. Nicotine, tar and smoke ashes are the contributing elements leading to 4364 life-claim in 2007. Even worse, second hand smoking could lead to additional death toll and torture people who never smoke before. In legal definition, restaurant is categorized as a public area. Thus, many citizens would pass this area accordingly. If there is even a small number of smoker inside the restaurant, they can still pass their disgusting cigarette smoke to others in the confined area. To be frank, this can lead to great inconvenience to non-smokers inside a place where they are supposed to eat. In scientific view, cigarette smoke is a kind of mutagen which can lead to irreversible harm. Why should we tolerate smoking such a selfish act in HK? Why should we tolerate cigarette smoke circulating around our fresh air and damaging our health? Another piece of rationale is that non-smoker contributes to over 90% of entire population in HK. For our public interest, we should protect the 90% non-smoker's health rather than indulge the 10% smoker eroding our health. With aforementioned, smoking should be banned at all restaurants!
