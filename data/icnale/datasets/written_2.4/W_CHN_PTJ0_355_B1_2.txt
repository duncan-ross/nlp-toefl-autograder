 To have a part-time job has been popular to college students now. Some students have the view that they can earn some money by themselves which can decrease the burden of their parents, and they can gain some experience to work so that they can do the other work better in the future. But another part of students don't agree with them. Because they think they are still students now and the most important thing for them is to learn more knowledge and try to get a great mark. It will cost a lot of time to do part-time jobs and they can only get a little money. College students should put their hearts into their majors, but not part-time jobs. In my opinion, college students have two school, one is what they are study in and the other is society. They should learn knowledge not only in the university, but also in society. So I recommend college students can do some part-time jobs if they have enough time. Society is the best school to us all and we must know how to adapt to society well. For college students, doing some part-time jobs is the best way so that they can develop in all-round way.
