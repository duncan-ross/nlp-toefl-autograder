About twenty five percent of our life span is being utilized by our studies, if we are lucky enough, because most of us don't receive our proper education due to financial problems. This finance is the biggest problem in a student's life. As we move to the higher levels, the education becomes more costly. I still remember that the my school fee wasn't even the half of my college fee, and my college fee wasn't even a quarter of my university dues. A number of students are not financially strong enough to endure their educational fee. This leads them to part time jobs. Most part time jobs are taken in the western culture including America and European countries, where a person becomes independent at an early age, unlike eastern culture where a person is highly family dependant. A person studies in the morning and work at night or vice versa. These part time jobs are not highly paying but it is sufficient enough for the needy person. Most of the these jobs are taken at restaurants, gas stations, stores etc. The part time jobs have a number of disturbing effects on the life of that person. These jobs are highly tiring, the deficiency of nap reduces the concentration on everyday works, the person becomes sick more often. Apart from these drawbacks part time jobs still give enough benefits for which its importance can't be ignored.
