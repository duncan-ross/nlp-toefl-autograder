I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is not good for your health and others. In the restaurants, non-smokers want to enjoy all their food to satisfy and eat for a good health of their body. Why should smokers bother them with their smoke? Research shows that 80% non-smokers is easily to get sick than the smokers. We usually hear this "Smoking cause cancer, heart attack, impotent, fetal disorders of pregnancy". It is not good for health. With cooperation from restaurants in the country, we can decrease the bad effects of smoking. If the restaurants allow their guests to smoke, please make a smoking room so it will not disturb the other guests. I have some experience, my uncle is a very heavy-smokers. By smoking all the times, his wife got a breast cancer and need to do some a surgery. First, it will waste a lot of money. Second, you do not want your family get hurts. By 10. 000, 00 rupiah, you will make all worst. If you want to smoke, avoid the people. Respect the other by smoking on another place like in the smoking room in the restaurants. In other country like Singapore, the price of cigarette is higher than in Indonesia. The bad effects of Indonesia's Cigarette are more dangerous than the other country too. So by avoiding them, we can save our life and people around us.
