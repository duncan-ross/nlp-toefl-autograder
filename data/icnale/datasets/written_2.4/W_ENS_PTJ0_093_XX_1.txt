Personally, I don't think that it's terribly important for a college student to have a part time job. If he or she really needs the money in order to pay tuition or to get by without starving, then I would deem it important to find some kind of work. However, if finances are not an issue, I don't believe that it's important or necessary. Perhaps there are a lot of people who think that working is a great life experience and that by working a part time job, college students will better understand the value of a dollar and the value of hard work. Don't you think that the 40 to 45 years of having to work after graduating is enough time to get that experience? I do. The youth of today have so many pressures as it is. I don't think that adding to that, the pressure of a part time job while they are trying to prepare for the rest of their lives, pass exams, fit into social clicks, avoid drugs and social rejection will make them a better person. If it is at all possible, I believe we should let the youth of today focus on their studies and let them enjoy a less complicated life before they are thrown to the working dogs for the remainder of their working lives.
