Have you ever seen the sign no smoking banding out the wall. Will you be annoyed because of the smoking? I think many people will say yes to these questions. For people who don't like smoking, of course, it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants in the country. In fact, many people say that it is justified to ban smoking in the restaurant. I agree with them. First, restaurants are public places. Smoking in them is too selfish. If smoke does harm to them, it is ok because they choose it. But other people around are harmed by the smoke too in the same restaurant. Secondly it will disturb the chatting between family and friends. When we are eating and smell the smoke in the restaurant, we feel very unhappy. We want a good place to have meals and chat with our family in the restaurant. Next is the safety to people in the restaurants. Because some people saw fire happened in restaurants sometimes are caused by people smoke there. Last, with the process of human's civilization, smoking is on the contrary of human's civilization. They are too selfish if they smoke in the restaurants. In short, as a civilized person and benefit the health of others, we should have a ban on smoking in restaurant.
