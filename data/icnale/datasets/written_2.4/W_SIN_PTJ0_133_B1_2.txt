Part time jobs are indeed the best learning experience before one enters the workforce. It is the time where one is often forgiven for mistakes made and given the opportunity to learn from them. One will also be given much guidance throughout their work, which is rather unheard of when one really enters the workforce. These varied expectations create a rare opportunity for part-timers to gain essential skills as well as hone their interpersonal skills amongst many other soft skills. It is also the perfect opportunity for one to expand one's network and get to know many people in the field which can be essential in their job searches in the future. These connections are exceptionally important, be it for job recommendations, or even to the basic level of receiving advice from former colleagues and superiors. On another note, part-time jobs also give part-timers firsthand experience to decide if an industry or a job is suitable for them and that they truly enjoy what they are doing. After all, it would be torturous to have a job where one dreads going to work every day and only looks forward to weekends and knock-off hours. Hence, I strongly urge everyone, be it students or people who wish to change careers to take on part-time jobs.
