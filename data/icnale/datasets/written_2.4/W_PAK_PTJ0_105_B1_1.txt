Part time job for college students is not good because if they do job then then they cannot manage their studies. But some students also manage their studies while doing job. In Pakistan there is unemployment as Pakistan is 6th number in the world in the unemployment. The students in Pakistan are doing part time jobs due to the poverty. Because in Pakistan there are many poor people which cannot manage their budget in their salary and as the fees of colleges, universities and schools are so much that they cannot afford them in their budget. If the students do not do job then they cannot pay their college fees. They are very needy to do jobs. They students which can do part time jobs can be destroy their health because at morning time they went to college and after college time then they go to their jobs and they will not concentrate on their studies and as a result they fail in their exams. Some students also part time job because in their houses there is no one present who will do job and get money for their family members. And if no one can get money in their hoses then how will they manage their budget and pay their fees. Some children also do job but cannot study. Because they cannot manage both hands meet. Some students also do part time jobs but they can also manage their studies and some can also go out of the country on their scholarship. So, some can manage their studies but some cannot. So, part time job is not good for students as they are future of Pakistan and this is responsibility of Government to provide money for their both hand meet.
