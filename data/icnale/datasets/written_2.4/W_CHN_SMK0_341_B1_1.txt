Recently, laws have been made to forbid smoking in public places. But in my opinions, smoking in public places should be allowed. First, many people has been addicted to smoking for a long period of time. They will surely feel uncomfortable if they keep staying in a non-smoking area. So they have to go outside alone to smoke. I think it is somehow unfair for them to do this. These people have just chose a way to lighten the pressure. And it's really hard to get rid of it. It's not proper to treat them unequally just because of this. But smoke will pollute the air in public places, definitely. Therefore, some ways should still be taken. I think that separate the place into two places which name'smoking area' and 'non-smoking area' can be a good choice. Some restaurants have already taken this. If the method is taken, smoking people can do what they like still inside the place, but not outside. And those who don't smoke or even hate smoking will be influenced little. All the people are then treated equally. To sum up, smoking is bad to some extent, but it's too strict to forbid smoking in public places.
