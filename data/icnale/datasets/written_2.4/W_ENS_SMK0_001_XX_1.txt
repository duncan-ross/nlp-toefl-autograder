I don't agree at all. I think that it should be left up to the owner's discretion. If we allow governments to legislate everything, supposedly in the publics' best interests, then where is it going to end? Next thing you know, they will start legislating how many tissues can be passed out at the train stations. If we give them too much power, then they will start to monitor everything that we do. I don't believe that it is the government's job and if commercial establishments a. k. a. restaurants, want to regulate their own establishments, then that's fine. I seriously believe that many governments are interfering far too much in ordinary folk's daily lives as it is. I feel that it would be far better just to have smoking and non-smoking restaurants and let customers decide for themselves where they want to eat. After all, that's called democracy and Japan has a democratic government don't they? I don't think that it is a good idea for the Japanese government to outright ban smoking in restaurants because I believe that it goes against the very principles of democracy. The people elect the government anyway, so why not put it to the people and let them and the restaurants decide? That would be the democratic thing to do in my view and I am certain that most people would have a lot more respect for the government rather than being told to do this and do that all the time.
