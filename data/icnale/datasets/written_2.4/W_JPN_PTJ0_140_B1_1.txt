I agree with this statement. I have four reasons. Firstly, as I have a part-time job, I could know the importance of money. Before I entered the university, I had been given money by parents every month and had wasted so much money. But after entering the university, I haven't been given money by parents and I came to play a lot. So I began to have a part-time job and I learned importance of earning money. Secondly, it is because that I think a part-time job is a step to join to society. When we take work, we must be polite for older people. But I am not used to behaving politely so I think I can acquire courtesy through a part-time job. Also, we may find what we want to do through a part-time job. I belong to business faculty, but I am interested in education while I work in cram school. Finally, it is because we can spend college life regularly. We are likely to be lazy during long vacation such as summer vacation, winter vacation, spring vacation and golden week. But we must go the place of part-time job before decided time, so we aren't likely to be lazy. Conclusion is that I agree with the statement that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
