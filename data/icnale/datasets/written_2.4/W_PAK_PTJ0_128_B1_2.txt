Part time job is a job which an individual performs at any organization for brief time for the sake of earning money. This could of the type that you have to spend a few hours at a job daily or you have to spend 2-3 complete days in a week for a job. There are many reason for which we have to adopt this course of action for earning money. The main reason is the bad financial conditions. Today there is economic recession in the whole world. And the poverty is increasing day by day. The people don't have much of the money to pursue their dreams of higher studies. So unwillingly they have to follow this course. In the day times they study at their schools and the evening they work at the hotels, libraries etc to manage their expenses. Some times along with their own expenses, they also have to earn something for their families as well. So it is a big social dilemma. Not only the student adopt the part time job but also the professional go for part time jobs to earn more money. for example doctors work in hospital for the whole day and in the evening times they run their own clinics. The reason once again is the lack of money. In doing all these thing we have to sacrifice one thing, that is, our social life. We are unable to give time to our family in a struggle to earn happiness for them. And in an unfelt manner they go very far from us. But the reason is once again the same, Poverty.
