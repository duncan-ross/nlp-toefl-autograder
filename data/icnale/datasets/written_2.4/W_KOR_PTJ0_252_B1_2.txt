I do not agree that having a part time job is important for college students. If the job helps them to find their desirable future job, it may be good for them. However, if the purpose of having a part time job is only to make money, it would be good for them not to do any. Doing a part time job can have a negative effect on students' study. College years are the crucial period when students think about and prepare for their future. It is only two or four years which is not enough to care about both study and a part time job. One of the critical elements for a better future job is getting a good grade. Grading is highly competitive in college and most students study hard to get a good grade. Students who have a part time job are unlikely to do a better job on their exams than other students who do not have one and only focus on studying. Making small amount of money is not worth missing chances to get a better job. Some students might say that they have to make money by doing a part time job to pay for college enrollment fee. It is not a good idea due to the reason above. It is better for them to use some student loans the government or other institutions offer and pay back after they get a job they want. There would be some interest for the loans but despite the interest it will be good for them to use a loan rather than to spend much time doing a part time job. It is because they might feel huge regret when they find themselves unable to get a desirable job owing to the time spending for the part time job they have done.
