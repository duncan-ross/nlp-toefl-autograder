I think smoking is a bad activity that can disturb our body and another people around the smoker. Peoples usually smoke after they eat food or drink a cup of coffee. It is the reason why restaurant didn't banned smoking at the restaurant. But, many people who not smoker banned smoking because it give disadvantage to their body as the passive smoker. In my opinion, I disagree with statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all, the restaurant in the country because it disadvantages the restaurant. The most disadvantages for the restaurant is decreases number of costumers because it decrease revenue of the restaurant and the restaurant can be closed. But, if the restaurants do not banned smoking, they also decrease revenue of the restaurant. So, the resolve of this problem is the restaurant must make smoking area and rule to the costumer. Smoking area is important because people who smoking can enjoy their cigarette and people who not smoking do not get the effect of the smoke from the cigarette. The restaurant not only make smoking area but also make a rule because if there is not a rule the smoking area not useful. It is a simple rule. If the smokers want to smoke after eat or drink something, they must choose smoke area.
