I agree with the statement. Because I have two reasons. The first reason is that smoking is harmful for human. It causes much sickness, especially cancer. People with it can even die. It is one of the most horrible diseases. I think that we take more smoke which Smoking people bring out at restaurants than at other places. Because restaurant is a place in which people eat something. The second reason is that I don't like smoking. I don't like smoking people. I do not stay near them. I do not talk with them. When I was a child, I was interested in tobacco which my grandfather smoked. Because I was a child who does not know that smoking does harm people. If I knew then, maybe I weren't interested in it. Smoking should be completely banned at not only restaurants but other official places. Because I do not like smoking at all, I want it disappear in the world rather than it is banned. I do not need it. It is not worth appearing for me. I deeply hope to live in the world without tobacco. So I am delighted in the present economy, in which tax of tobacco is high rate in Japan. That's why I agree with the statement.
