 I agree with the statement "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. " While the decision to smoke is a personal lifestyle choice that should not be regulated, it has harmful repercussions on the rest of society that necessitates the implementation of rules and regulations pertaining to smoking. The health risks of second hand smoking have already been well documented. Therefore, allowing smoking in a contained area like restaurants will exacerbate the health risks. Although some restaurants provide designated areas for smokers, the stench and smoke that linger around greatly inconvenience the rest of the customers. The rules may be discriminatory towards smokers, but such an activity has negative externalities for the rest of society. Besides, heavy smokers who are unable to resist the temptation to smoke during a meal probably only make up a minority of the population. Most smokers are courteous and self-aware enough to not smoke indoors, where the majority are non-smokers. Moreover, there are plenty of public locations for smokers to smoke if they wish to do so. Only restricting smoking in restaurants is a reasonable policy, and not too much to ask for in my opinion. Therefore laws against smoking in public places are justified.
