Smoking is a bad habit. I never like the cigarettes and smokers as well. The smoke of the cigarettes causes cancer of lungs along with other disease. Its so dangerous for health as drinking rather according to my point of view it's even more dangerous than a snake because even a snakman know that snake is dangerous but a smoker never thinks that cigarettes is dangerous he/she just love it. We should avoid to sit in the company of the smokers because it's smoke effect the nearby person more than the smoker. The reason is that the smoker inhale the smoke that is filtered while the persons in his/her company inhale un-filtered smoke that is more dangerous for health. In Pakistan it is law that cigarettes should not be sold to the persons who are under eighteen but unfortunately it is disobeyed. There is no one monitoring the sale of cigarette even if a policeman see someone smoking who is under eighteen, he never takes any action. Some people adopt this habit in the childhood when they see someone of their elders smoking while some people start smoking when they are young as a fashion or style but after sometime they become chain smokers. Some people start smoking when they are in tension because generally smokers say that cigarette releases the tension. We should aware the people from the drawbacks of smoking. We should not hate smoker but we should hate smoking.
