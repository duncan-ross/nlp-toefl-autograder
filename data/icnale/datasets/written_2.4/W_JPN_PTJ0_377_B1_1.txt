It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree this opinion. I will explain why I agree it. 'Experience', I think it is the most important and precious thing for younger generation. Think about university students, most of them had not worked from small age to 19 or 20 years old. Because they have to enter famous university, so they study and study every day. Only they do is 'study on the desk'. But after they graduate university, most of them must be work. Now I run a small company, I think people who can't think by themselves are increasing recently. Their style of thinking is one way. They don't know that there are various kind of people in the world. They only know their small world, family or friends. It is a serious social problem. And another problem is there. About 40% people who are just out of university leave their company within three years. Most of them say that the work does not different one what they think about. Or they do not feel interests about their work. They think the job is not fit for them. Of course'part-time-job' may take time from them. The problem may occur. Some students do only work instead of their study. But, 'Part-time-job' for university students will give them precious experiences and many important things. They will learn about the structure of world. And they will feel how difficult to earn their own money. 'Part-time-job' will give them many presents.
