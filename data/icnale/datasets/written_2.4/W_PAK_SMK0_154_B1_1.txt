Probably each of us has experienced a situation, when we were sitting in a restaurant and someone near started to smoke a cigarette. We became unwillingly second-hand smokers. This is happening to me very often and every time I wish smoking would be banned in public places. Restaurant is a place for rest and not gets disturbed physically and mentally. If it got banned we can save ourselves from a number of diseases, can have a reasonable environment which is suitable for families in restaurants. Smoking in restaurants is a disruption to everyone's meal, not just the smokers. The dividers that restaurants owners provide do not keep the smoke from spreading to non-smoking areas. Ventilation along with dividers may be a way to solve the smoke problem. A lot of people argue that smokers have their rights and that we live in a democratic country, where everyone can do whatever he wants as far as he does not break the laws. According to these people legalization of a law, which prohibits smoking in public places is against the personal rights of the smokers. After all, they are not violating the rights of the others, because the non-smokers can leave whenever they want. But would it not be more reasonable for the smoker to leave when they want to smoke a cigarette? In my opinion it would, because the smoker wants to do something that limits the people around him and not vice versa. It is known that smoking is unhealthy and causes cancer. But not many people try to stop the spreading of it. In conclusion I would say that many smokers gradually give up smoking if they have to overcome complex obstacles each time when they want to light a cigarette. Consequently, banning smoking in public places leads to decrease of smoking generally and especially of young generation. Better health and lower medical cost are the results.
