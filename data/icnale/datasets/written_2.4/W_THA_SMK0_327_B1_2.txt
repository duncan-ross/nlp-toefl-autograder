Strongly agree because Restaurant is a source of community. Restaurant is a place where people of all ages to service. Smoking in is not celebrity a location and others are toxic substances from tobacco smoke inhalation and create a boring to others. The stop smoking in restaurants is good and the prevention of diseases of the respiratory system disorder is another way And the amount of air pollution reduction. In restaurants should be ban on smoking in the restaurant or may be the only place for smokers to completely odor out of brit fate outside to avoid disturbing those in the restaurant. So I agree for Stop Smoking in restaurants in the country but to make possible very difficult, it should start from the campaign to reduce quitting smoking in the family, which will can result in the larger community. For the stop smoking in restaurants is to reduce the spread of a toxic mold from smoking in one and good for those who had to eat out every day. For restaurant owners should be organized in support of banning smoking in their restaurant. When everyone realizes penalties and disadvantages which will arise in the future it will all have to pretend fear of possible danger. Therefore, we should work together to provide all the security in the lives of everyone and happy in life today.
