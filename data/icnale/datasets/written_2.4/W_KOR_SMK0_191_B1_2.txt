Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't agree on this topic. Well, first, I'm not smoker. And I don't like smoking. But all of the world, it has the smoker and non-smoker. Also, people are having the right of freedom. This begin so, they have the right to smoke. But, it is important one thing. They should not be harm for non-smoker. Of course, smoking is harmful the most of people. Most restaurants have smoking section and non-smoking section. But, it is others don't. All restaurants have smoking section and non-smoking section. That must be expected. Because, the restaurants in the smoking people and non-smoking people. The restaurants having the smoking section is not harmful to nonsmokers. That is the rule designated. The rule is all the restaurants have smoking rooms. And second rule, they should be monitored the kids keep smoking areas. Because, smoking a most of harm to children. When it is not the rules, they deserve punishment. It is that. They must pay fine. Because, non-smokers' rights of living in the clean environment. Therefore, we should be rights of non-smokers. Thus, all of the country restaurants should have the smoking section. Smoking section is certainly having the restaurants. Therefore, I don't agree on this topic.
