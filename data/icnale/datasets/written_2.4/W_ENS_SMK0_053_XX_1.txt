The most important thing is not to ban smoking in restaurants in Japan. The most important thing is to ban smoking at all public places. If they do not do this, everyone's health will be endangered. I had to watch several of my older relatives die as a result of lung cancer, and it was very sad. I really hope that no one else has to see something like that. The only way to insure that is to do more than simply banning smoking in restaurants. The only way to do that is to ban smoking period. It will take a lot of work to do that because a lot of people like to smoke a whole lot. They have a very hard time quitting, and so it will be difficult to ban smoking. But with any luck, we can do so in the next hundred years at the most. If we can do this in the U. S., it will set a great example for other countries. At that time, if smoking is still allowed in Japanese restaurants, they will probably decide to ban it there too. That's because a lot of countries like to follow the U. S. when it comes to stuff like this.
