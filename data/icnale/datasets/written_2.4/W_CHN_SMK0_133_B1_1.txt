 Someone likes to smoking, but someone does not like. If somebody smoke in the restaurant, he may disturb others or annoy someone. But, I am not in favor of banning smoking in the restaurants completely. Those are my reasons. Firstly, I don't believe that everyone can stop smoking when he stays in some place. To the heavy smokers, stopping them smoking is terrible like death. Secondly, for example, in our country, the cigarette companies are in the control of the government. Its benefits for the government are great, which advances the development of our country's economy. Thirdly, smoking or not is determined by smokers themselves. No one can force them to do something. In my opinion, smoking can be banned at some restaurants in the country, but not all. Whether smoking should be banned depends on the restaurants'needs. I have some suggestions. The restaurants can provide a special room for the smokers. And if the restaurants have the conditions, they can equip with equipment of dealing with the snoking. All of those are my ideas.
