In my thought the part time job sometime we have to do it because if you don't like the full-time job or you are lazy to do it, you must take this kind of job. This kind of job is easy to pay with no long term commitment and not a hard working. When I working in the future, I still don't like it because the part-time job stills the work that too risk for firing and I don't like it. Sometime the part time job is the job that you can create by yourself such as the baker in the bakery shop or the coffee maker that they called Barista. It's made you feel free and feel comfortable to do the thing you like and be the boss of your own job. You will proud about it. At last, you can do the thing you like, but at first you still have to find your full-time job to guarantee that you will get the insurance about healthy or the dentist thing. So you will be feeling good about that. And then if you are getting old or boring to your full-time job and acquire enough money for make the new business; just go for it because if you are love your job you will get the better thing to your life.
