During college, we practice being independent. For preparation in stepping into the real world. That is why, most people would wish to gain several experiences that would be useful in the future. For exmaple, having a part time job and taking up college in the same time. Having part time jobs that would have several benefits for the college students after they had graduate. For one it would help them learn financial independence. While still finishing ones studies, the money that they earned from their part time jobs could help them support by themselves their studies. Than having to always be supported by their parents and this time around they could help their parents with some expenses, helping them somewhat lessen the things that they need to worry about. At the same time, they could save up money that they could use in the future. In doing so, they would be able to learn that budgeting ones expenses is very important. After college, this could help them when applying for a job. For nowadays, employers would give importance to the applicants job experiences and use it for assesment in whether to hire him or not. So, in a way this could help them having a high possiblity in being accepted. However, it depends whether the said experience you had in your part time job is related to the job your applying. At present, it is evident that it's hard to find a job, especially a permanent one. That would have a good pay. However if one would be able to find one, there are cases that you won't get the job. And I believe in a saying that someone had told me and that is It is better to have been prepared than to have regret it later.
