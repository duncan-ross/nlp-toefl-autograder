I disagree to smoking. So I want to show you some my thinks. First, I think you get no merit with smoking. I heard that it has more than 300 bad influents. Cuzz of those, it is to be feared that you'll be ill. For example, heart disease, lungs disease, cancer, and so on. Does it only effect to you own who is smoking? The answer is No. Probably you smoke from a filter, but others who are near you, makes to smoke, moreover with no filter. Do you know the influences about smoking to infants or children who are still in mother's stomach? The percentage of children with smoking parents become foolish is much more higher than the children with normal parents. This is second reason. If you want to, or NEED to smoke, You MUST smoke at smoking area. I think it is the least manor for public. And the third reason is the dust problem. I think you have seen many or some dust about cigarettes any where. Cigarettes which are end, boxes of cigarettes, lighter, and so on. Those make bad visual, bad mood, and bad feelings. I cunt believe that those people throw away those dust. In these wards, I disagree to smoking.
