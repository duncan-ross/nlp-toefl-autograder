As a college students, we have more free time. So we can choose some of part-time job to do. Everything has two sides. Part-time job also both have its advantages and disadvantages. Of course, There are many advantages part-time job can bring to us. Firstly, the experience. We all know that working experience is important to us in this society. Well, how can we get the working experience in university? Part-time job is one of the ways. No matter how, have experience is better than have nothing. Secondly, the chance. Everyone has its own ability, but not everyone has chance to use his or her ability. That's the point, so part-time job give us a way to have more chances. Imaging, if your work ability is good, you may have been noticed by your boss, then you may have a good opportunity to enter this company after you graduate from school. The society is full of competition. Lots of college students couldn't find job after they graduate. Think about that. Part-time job may bring you a brighter future. But on the other side, part-time job eat the time of study. Many of my friends said to me that they have no time to study. Why? Because of they have more than one part-time job. There's no doubt that they would have no time to study. So I think if a college student wants to have a part-time job. He or she must find a balance point between study and job. Anyway, we are still students, so we must have enough time to study. That's what I think about the part-time job brings to us. What I want to say is that if you want to have a part-time job. Just do it, but don't forget about your study. That's enough.
