Now a day in such a fast growing economy there is very difficult for man to live its both ends. In our society where private colleges are offering many new courses and diplomas for getting jobs and secure futures. There is very difficult for parents to pay such high fees and get admission of their children in private colleges. So a student who wants his dreams come true should have apart time job to fulfil his requirements and necessities. Our growing income is pushing back many middle class people to lower class because of their short incomes and rising problems. In this situation many of the students have to sacrifice for their studies and should find a job to pay their college dues. So we can say that part time jobs are becoming the necessity of college student particularly of middle class students. The part time jobs are not only due to poverty but also some passionate students wants to be independent but in this way we can't say it as essential but we can say it as passion. It reduces the time of study for students on the other hand it improves their abilities. And they are able to step in their practical life.
