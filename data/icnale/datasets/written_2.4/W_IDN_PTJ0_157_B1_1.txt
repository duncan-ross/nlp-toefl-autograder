I disagree if the students had a part time job. In era globalization, total of poverty increased in our country. Much family who live in lack or poverty because of lack of employment opportunities and education. But, it is not the true reason to students had a job. There are several reasons. First, every parents endowed children. So, the parents have a responsibility to he's wife or husband and they children. As we know, not only man can look for a job on outside home but woman can do the same thing. Second, if the students spent he or her time in the workplace big perhaps can be interfering he or she study like homework'n study group with the friends after school or at the friend's house. Third, when he or she cannot be concentration or focus to the study of course can be to make a difficult to get the high scores in the every material. Except, they (students) cannot enjoy of youth like playing with the friends. So, every parents have a responsibility to he's family from household, foresight of his children and make his family felt happy. The husband and wife should be support each other to make a family of happy.
