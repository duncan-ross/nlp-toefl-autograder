Smoking in restaurant is so bad behavior because it is a place that many people join in this place. So, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country for three reasons. The first reason is that it disturb the happy time for families. Many families go to restaurants for new and clean atmosphere but someone is smoking, their happy time can stop. The second reason is that it is bad for health. We know that smoking is bad for health both who smoke and don't smoke especially children and older. Because in restaurants have every age. The third reason is that it is dangerous if cigarette still have fire. In restaurants have a lot of woods that is the good material to build fire. So that it can destroy the restaurant and much life. Finnally, many people hope a restaurant is the place that can give them happy time because restaurant's owner provide many facilities for their customers. Then costomer trust in service. If some people smoke in a restaurant, for sure that it can destroy a good atmosphere in a restaurant. Moreover, it is not only destroy a good atmosphere and harm customers' health, but also the accident by cigarette can happen all the time. So, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
