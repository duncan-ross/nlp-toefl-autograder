Recently, there's a widespread concern over the issue that smoking in public should be banned or not. In my point of view, I'm really for the voice of banning public smoking. It is known to all that smoking does bad to human's body seriously. It is very harmful to our health. It will also increase the risk of getting horrible diseases. If one smokes in public, he will make other people around him breathe second-hand smoke. Other people will feel very uncomfortable. Also, their health will be damaged. Last but not least, smoking in public also cause a lot of environment problems. Many smokers just throw the unsmoked part of the cigarette away on the road or some other places nearby such as flower pots. It looks so disgusting. In some dry places, throwing fired cigarettes away even makes it easier to get on fire. To conclude, smoking in public is really bad to others. It not only pollutes the air, but also does harm to people's health and safe. So, in my opinion, smoking in public should be banned really and people who do not obey the banning rules should be punished seriously. Also, a ban on smoking in public places would also help reduce health care costs. Fewer people would need to be treated for the lung maladies that result from breathing in the smoke exhaled by others.
