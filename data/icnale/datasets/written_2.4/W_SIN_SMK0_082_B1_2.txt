The tide has turned fairly recently against smokers, in that they were once a fairly well-reprenseted minority, but now seen as a nuisance minority. But minorities have rights, in my opinion; why should we have the tyranny of the majority? Hence, in this country, I think smokers should be allowed to smoke, if the restaurant owners permits them so. Smoking is not a great habit, but I pick my nails and people are imperfect, and people do have rights, so smokers are well within reason to do what they like to do and bear the consequences of them doing so. Restaurant owners are well within their own rights to do the same as well and decide for themselves how they would like to operate their own place. And hungry people can decide for themselves where they would like to patron. What is the problem? There is no debate. Moreover, the concerns with second hand smoking are overblown: never had seen second hand smoke as the leading cause of death. And as always, we choose who we want to hang out, or where we want to hang out, and we can always vote with our feet and try to change things around us, so let others do the same as well.
