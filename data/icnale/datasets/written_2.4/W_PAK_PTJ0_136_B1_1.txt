It is undeniable that the much important matter for college students is to master specialty knowledge, in order to graduate with a high mark, especially in business, in which the diploma plays a basic role. In this sense, we college students study hard day by day, without having a part-time job. However, I think having a part-time job isn't in contradiction with getting a high mark. In fact, it gives a hand with improving our ability witch is necessary for hunting a satisfying job. Not only the theory but also experience counts in dealing with tasks. But what we learn from our schoolbooks is much theories and little experience. Just having a part-time job can abolish this imbalance. What's more, having a part-time job can help us develop a patient, friendly and easy-going characterize. There is no doubt that it can make a nice atmosphere for us. On the other hand, the money we earn from part-time job is another unexciting harvest; with which dealing with economic difficulty will be easier. As members of the younger generation, we mustn't depend on our parents any longer. What we must do is developing our working ability and having a part-time job is a good choice for us. Having receiving higher education does not mean that we are superior to others. The work others can do, we can do it.
