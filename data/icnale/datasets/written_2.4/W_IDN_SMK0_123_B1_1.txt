I agree I think the government should be make a rule about smoking. In Indonesia, smoking is a habit. Part of Indonesia society is smoker. In a day the smoker usually spent the cigarette more than one pack. They think smoking is nice activity. Although smoking is dangerous for our healthy. Because the contain of cigarette smoke including arsenic, ammonia, hydrogen, and other toxic substances. It cause many disease such as respiratory problem, liver, cancer, etc. But active smoker have big risk than passive smoker, because the active smoker produce more cigarette every day. The smoker often smoking in anyplace, and cigarette smoke can disturb other people. The government must ban the smoker to smoking in anyplace, especially in the restaurant. Because restaurant is place to eat, and produce any food. If the other people smoking in there, that will be disturb other customers and ruin the clean environment. 1. The cigarette smoke will be damage the smell and the taste of food 2. The cigarette smoke can disturb the breath The rule to ban smoking in the restaurant is very important, every restaurant has to make a room for the smoker. So, the cigarette smoke isn't disturb the other customers in the restaurant, and they will enjoy and comfortable having food without cigarette smoke.
