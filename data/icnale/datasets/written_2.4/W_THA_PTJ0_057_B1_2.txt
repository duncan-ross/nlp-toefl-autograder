I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job but from another part some teenager think that it's not important to have a part-time job because the first things that they have to do when they are student is study hard and they have to use their time appropriate with their age. But in my side, if students can do the part-time job and manage their time together, it is great. Student can find some new experience outside the class. They will face the trouble and solve it by using their skill that they have met before. Moreover they will have to meet another people. Contacting with people, student have to respect to talker and intelligent to talk and Sociability, student should know what talker think or feel to do the best with him/her. So, Speaking skills and social skills is very important. Student will improve their thinking from the job, they will not only think to spend their life but they also think about their life and think about the people that they love. They can do many things by relying on themselves. If students do the job before, students will know before what job that they can do best or what job that they like. Everything have more than one part if you decide to doing something you have to make sure that you can do it.
