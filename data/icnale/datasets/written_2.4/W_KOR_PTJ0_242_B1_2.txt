There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that students can learn about society. The other reason is that students can learn more responsibility of spending money. First reason is that students who have part time job can learn about society. Specifically, they can learn about responsibility as employee. Students should go to work even if they have quiz or many papers. Also, they can know how to write application form and statement of purpose. If student does not have any experience of working as part-timer, they cannot know and exercise writing forms. This lack of experiment makes for them to have difficulties when they should get a job near future. Second reason is that they can learn responsibility of spending money. They can know difficulties of making money, so these difficulties makes for them to get more responsibility of spending money. For example, many students who do not have any earn money spend easily too much money, so they often have great amount of debt. When students attend college, making money teach them how to manage and spend money. For above reasons, I strongly claim that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
