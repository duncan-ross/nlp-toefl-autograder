Students need to get some form of employment experience as soon as possible so that they may compete in the marketplace. They would also learn some valuable skills to assist them in making the transition from college to full-time employment. Having a part-time job would give them a little more credibility when applying for jobs and teach them things like organizing their time, responsibility and accountability which are the basic requirements in most jobs. Unless students join the military, they will also require a certain amount of problem solving skills and be able to think independently. Having a part-time job would at least expose them to these areas so that they can see for themselves what is considered to be the normal standard and the minimum level that they would have to function at. Surprisingly, I find that many students are completely oblivious to even the most basic workplace 101 requirements and are in dire need of a reality check. If they had part-time work experience then they would be better prepared to handle the transition from college to work more readily. I also feel that most employers would expect that students had done some form of work or served an internship during their college years and have a grasp of the work environment.
