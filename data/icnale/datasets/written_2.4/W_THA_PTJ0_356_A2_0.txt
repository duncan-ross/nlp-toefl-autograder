Part-time job is a good one to get money it is not hard work. Almost everyone can do it, we can make more money and we don't have to ask our parents for money. I think it is a good one for college students. It's a good job for college student because it does not have to work in class time, and the most important one is we can help decrease our parents' expense. Part time job is just a part of college life, we have to pay attention in class belong with the part-time, it would be the best. People who tend to get the best job more than other people are people who have more work experience. Due to human responsibilities, students who study in a university should already have abilities to live by themselves. That is they should do a part-time job. When they graduate from the university, they have to find a job. Therefore, while they are studying in the university, they should have a part-time job to train them before getting the job in the future. Moreover, having opportunity to have a part-time job while they are studying in the university is a good chance to get a job in the future. Many managers want people who have work experiences to work in their company. As a result, if the students have experiences about the job while they are studying in the university, it will help them a lot to get a good job in the future. Additionally, they can help their parents to save find and money while they are studying in the university. So, I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
