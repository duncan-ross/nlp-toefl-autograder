Part-time job is a type of job that a person age from 18 years old and above are willing to take the chance from being a non-tired person into a challenging and entering the world of employment and businesses. The reason behind why some students are taking the chance because of financial problems. We all know that there are many students in the Philippines that do not have the opportunity to enroll in college division. Especially to those high school students who came from very far province. That's why these students apply for part-time job to earn some money to be able to enroll in college and may finished their studies. We can also see few students that are currently enrolled and yet every evening and midnight, they are applied in part-time job. Maybe because they also need some financial resources to be able to help their parents, guardians or whoever who are giving the tuition fees to them. Workers are considered to be part time if they commonly work fewer than 30 or 35 hours per week The advantages of this are, you can spend some time at work, you can get pocket money instead of having no money and most of all it helps you to build your character and it teaches you responsibility. Disadvantages are, you cannot make as much as you could for full time, you still have to work very hard for the job so that you can maintain your accumulate hours and foremost you should be there when you're scheduled or else, you will be fired. For me, part-time job is another way and step to the realistic world. Because you are entering the new beginning or chapter of your life, on how to spend time and how to manage your time.
