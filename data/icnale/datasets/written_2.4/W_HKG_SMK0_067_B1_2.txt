Is there any benefit of smoking? Tell me if there's any, otherwise, why shouldn't we ban it? No, we shouldn't. Cigarette contains thousands of chemicals. Most of them are harmful to humans. Lung cancer tops one of the most fatal diseases in Hong Kong. Cigarette, obviously, is the main killer. First handed smoking is harmful while second handed smoking is even more harmful. Restaurants always gather groups of people and the circulation systems installed are usually old fashioned. Because of the poor indoor air circulation, even smoking eaters are of small portion, the whole restaurant will soon be misted with smokes. Large portion of eaters is suffering from second handed smoking. This is an irresponsible behavior to poison others while you are poisoning yourself. To provide a clean, clear and non-poisoned eating environment, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Some may argue for exemptions in bars, discos and others. Eaters from these restaurants are mainly smokers but carcinogenic cigarette is still carcinogenic. Other non-smoking eaters and workers are still exposed to thousands of chemicals. Banning smoking at all restaurants is not against smokers, but to work for a better environment for eaters and workers as well as all of us.
