I sort of agree. But maybe it would be better just to have different restaurants for smokers and non-smokers. At least they get to choose for themselves without having to be mothered. I don't know about Japan, but in Australia the government is always telling us what to do and we think that it would be nice if they asked us what we wanted sometimes. From what I've seen in Japan so far and the restaurants that I have been to, there seems to be a lot of smokers here so maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to ban smoking because the restaurants and in the end, the government would lose money with profits and taxes etc. I admit though, that at a couple of restaurants that I went to, it was really smelly and the place stank pretty bad but it was a bit small so maybe they need better fans or something. Being from Australia and as I said before, we usually think that it is a good idea to ask us (the people) first before the government goes off and does their own thing. Maybe the Japanese people might feel the same way? I don't know but I think that it would be a good idea to ask them.
