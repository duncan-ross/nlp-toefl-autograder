Currently, the law has banned people to smoke in public in Taiwan, so generally no one is allowed to smoke at the restaurants. However, it has not been completely banned because restricted places or rooms can be set for these smokers. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Taiwan. The main reason is because even second-handed smoke harms people's health. The dust produces from the lit cigarettes would not only spread to the smokers' lungs but also the surrounding people's. According to the surveys, people who get second-handed or even third-handed smokes are harmed greater than those who smoke. In other words, except for the temporary happiness of those who make the harmful materials around, there are no benefits to anyone; even the restricted areas cannot avoid this problem. Other reasons might include the bad smell caused by smoking will result in ruining a great mood when you start to enjoy good food. After all, what makes you enjoy the meal is the delicacy smell from food rather from the heavy smoking smell. Therefore, smoking should be completely forbidden at all the restaurants in Taiwan in the consideration of people's health and the atmosphere of enjoying the food.
