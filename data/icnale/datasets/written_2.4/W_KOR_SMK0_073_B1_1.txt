I absolutely agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the food restaurants in the country. Because restaurant always must be clean. When I was young, I went to Gal-bi restaurant with my family. My father and my brother, of course, smoke, but him never smoking at restaurant. So I always ate food at restaurant. But, that day a man was smoking at restaurant!! In restaurant! I was eating Gal-bi, I caught because his smoking. I really loved Gal-bi but the smoking smell made me angry. So I had no appetite. I keep engaging him but he didn't know that what he faulted. These days, almost restaurant regard cleanliness. Even coffee shops. But a few restaurants in far country didn't regard cleanliness. I feel a little dusty and uncomfortable. Because I came my childhood's nightmare. I really want they stop smoking. I want to live cleaner world. I want to eat cleaner restaurant. Smoking is so scare disease like a drug. Smoking offers lung cancer and laryngitis and many various bad diseases. The lung cancer leads to the death. Didn't be a clean world? The world and all restaurants must be clean! So smoker try to quire the smoking now.
