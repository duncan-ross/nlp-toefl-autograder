In Taiwan, we have lots of smokers ages from 20 to over 60. Sometimes I can find a young school boy smoking on the sideway. And even my father and my grandfather smoke cigarette, too. It seemed to be a normal situation that you can see it and smell it from your daily life. We all know that cigarette is terribly bad to our health. However, those people who are addictive to smoking are hard to quit their habit. The issue, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, is too strict to me. I don't agree. First, I must say that I don't smoke. And I don't like the smell of it, either. I deeply know how much it can hurt my lung and my health. However, when talking about strictly banning smoking in all the restaurants in the whole country is another difficult problem. According to that issue, if the government begins doing this kind of regulation, I bet it will cause lots of complaints, struggles, and messes. People love to smoke and business men who run restaurants will definitely make a big noise. For a consumer who goes to restaurants like me, I am on the benefit side. I don't have to stand the bad smell anymore but enjoy my meal. However, I think if we want to limit those smokers, we should set a standard to list all the restaurants in Taiwan. To clarify restaurants achieve what kind of level should obey this rule. If the restaurant is just a small store beside a road or just a night market vender, should they follow this rule, too? Otherwise, we can just set a smoking place or smoking room in the restaurants for those smokers.
