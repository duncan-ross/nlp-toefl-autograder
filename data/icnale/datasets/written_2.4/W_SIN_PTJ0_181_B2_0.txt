College students are given much more independence in learning, especially in Singapore with a rigid primary and secondary education system. As such, the time that college students have should be balanced between school work and extra-curriculum activities. However, college fees are quite steep in most colleges, hence if a college student were to face financial difficulty, they have two options. One option would be to try and obtain a scholarship, bursary, grant or loan. However the success of obtaining these depends on a variety of factors from parents' income to the interview outcome. If a college student fails to receive any financial assistance from the college or external vendors, it is quite a good thing to work part-time in order to meet the school fee amount every semester. Parents of these students might insist on doing this- earning extra cash to support their child's education, while their child focuses on only school. However if these college students decide to personally improve their financial burdens, many lessons and life skills could be imparted to them in the process. Examples of lessons learnt by having a part-time job are the idea that money comes by working hard and also, these college students will pick up work ethics that will help them excel in their future field of work when they work professionally. These lessons can also be learnt by financially stable college students as well, however I feel that a student under financial strain would find these lessons more potent and invaluable. Therefore, I feel that it is important for college students to have a part-time job so that they can pick up life skills that are rarely taught in the classroom. But I feel that this is especially important for financially-strained students.
