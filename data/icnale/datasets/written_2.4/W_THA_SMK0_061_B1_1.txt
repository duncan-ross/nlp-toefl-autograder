Smoking is a bad thing that I hate. Smoking has a lot of disadvantages such as make a poisonous in air pollutions and destroy your lung, etc. My family has no one like smoking, because my mother hates it. When I stay near some one that smoking, I will go far from there I don't like it too much. Cigarettes has a bad thing in it. The smoker will get a little disadvantage but the people who stay near or around will get more disadvantage than smoker. When I was young a little girl, I ask my mother why they must smoking. My mothers said they think it's their drunk. I said to my mother I won't smoke. Now I am18 years old, I still don't smoke. I like to eat other that have a lot of advantage. Sometimes that I must hang out with my friends I wont smoke. I only drink some alcohol because I must have a society. In pub always have people who smoke and I will feel so bad I will go away from these people In my closed friend group have no anyone smoke. I think it's a good thing I don't like smoking.
