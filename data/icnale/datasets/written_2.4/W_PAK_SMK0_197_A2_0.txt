Smoking should be banded in restaurants/hotels or not? I am totally agreed with this point of view but here the question arises that how can a act of an individual person is harmful for others. Every person is independent and in the whole world there is no law of interfering in one's personal life. But one's independence ends where his right starts. It's the responsibility of a person that his act will not harmful for others. everyone knows that smoking is less harmful for smoker or more harmful for the people sitting near him. In hotels or returners where people come for relaxation or enjoyment a smoker creates a bad impact. People dislikes him and teenagers attracts towards him, the craze of smoking develops in their minds. Smoker disturbs People by smoke while they are eating food or anything else. It also causes serious diseases. So what should we have to do in this situation? In this situation it is a responsibility of hotel management to make smoking rooms or band smoking in sitting or dinning hall. It's also the responsibility of government to assign security, police or special rangers to stop smoking in public places. It would be beneficial for our society.
