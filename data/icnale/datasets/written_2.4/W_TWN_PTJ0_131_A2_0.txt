I think college students should have a part-time job in their college life. It can learn a lot out of the class. For example, you can learn how to talk to the customer or hoe to face the problem you face. And you can earn money by your own. I think even school can teach you how to learn the math questions or how the history is, but it can teach you how to face the question in our daily life. Maybe someone will say, you can't learn a lot from part-time job, but I think the job can give you more than money. When I enter college, many people just study, study, and study. They didn't do anything out of class. I think it's not good, because they just know a part of school life, they didn't see more about world. In my college life, I did some part-time jobs. From cram school to restaurant, I think the experient is so great for me that I can't tell everyone. My boss also taught me a lot, because their experiences are more than me. I am glad to meet them, and I think I won't forget it until been an old woman. So I just know college students can learn a lot from part-time jobs, and if you don't forget you are a student, you will be great in your study and your part-time job life.
