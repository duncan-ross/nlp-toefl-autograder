Excellent idea! How soon can it be set up? Honestly, I'm surprised that it has taken this long for Japan to consider this ban. Smoking related deaths and sicknesses in Japan are increasing, not decreasing and the number of illnesses that can be attributed to passive smoking, are also on the rise. While I guess that there might be a huge backlash at first, people would adopt the idea soon enough and a ban can only help the health situation in the long run. Too bad if the smokers disagree because really, no one is telling them not to smoke, just where they are not allowed to smoke which seems perfectly OK to me. Why should others be inconvenienced or be put at risk if they don't want to suck in secondhand smoke? If people are working near inflammable substances and there are smoking restrictions in place, nobody seems to mind and everybody understands readily enough. For me, it just makes perfect sense to do the same thing in restaurants and public places because chemicals from smokes can kill and cause disease which makes it high risk just to go to a restaurant and eat out. Let's make the world a safer place to live in and start by cleaning up the air that we breathe.
