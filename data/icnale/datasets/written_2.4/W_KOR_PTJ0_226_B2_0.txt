If you go to the convenience store or fast food restaurant, you can easily find university students working as a part-time job. I also have a lot of part-time experiences. Some think that college students should study hard on their major solely so that having part-time job is a waste. However, I believe that having part-time job is beneficial for college students by teaching two lessons to students: sociability and the importance of earning money. Firstly, working experience will give lessons how to interact with other people. You cannot develop the sociability through studying in front of the desk. For example, while I was working in the food restaurant, I could learn the difficulties and importance of encountering people. You would never know how to deal with lots of people and giving out great services according to the customer is really hard when you only stay in front of the desk. Secondly, you would realize the importance of earning money. You may find out that earning money is difficult. In my case, I mopped, cleaned the dishes, cashed money, and delivered the food for five hours a day and I paid only 5000 won (almost five dollars) per hour. It was really hard to earn money. It also gave me the motivations to study harder to get a good job, which can pay me a lot of money without this kind of physical effort. To sum up, I strongly think that having a part-time job as a college student is important because it is beneficial for students by giving two great lessons. They would learn how to deal with people in the pragmatic situations, and they can learn the importance of earning money by realizing the hardness of labor. Students, let's taste the hardness of labor to grow up!
