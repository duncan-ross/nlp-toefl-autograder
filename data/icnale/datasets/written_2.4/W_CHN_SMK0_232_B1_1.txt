 Smoking cigarettes is not a good habit, because it is harmful to both smoker and people around him. So I think smoking should be strictly forbidden in public places. Firstly, smoking in public places is impolite to others. Everyone has its right to enjoy in public places, while smoking pollutes the air we breathe, thus worsen our working efficiency. Secondly, smoking is extremely harmful to our health. The nicotine contained in cigarette may get us addicted to smoking gradually. Cigarette is the chief cause of lung diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancers. According the survey of World Health Organization, more than 8000 people died of cancer everyday. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker's health, but it also hurts people staying with the smoker as well. It's called 'Passive smoking' and it not less harmful than smoking by oneself. Thirdly, smoking may be a threat to safety as well. Burning cigarettes may ignite things around that can burn easily, and finally cause a big fire. An unconsciously dropped cigarette end may cause a great loss of material and life property. In addition, smoking is a bad education to the next generation. In many families, sons gain the habit of smoking because his father smokes. In conclusion, smoking is an improper behavior in public places, for it's harmful in many aspects. So smoking should be prohibited in public places for everyone's sake.
