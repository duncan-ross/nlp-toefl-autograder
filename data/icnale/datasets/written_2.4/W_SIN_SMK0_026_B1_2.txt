I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Firstly, as it will protect the general health of everyone in the country, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. According to the economics term, smoking is a negative externality. It has no benefit to anyone, not even the person who is smoking. In fact, smoking has been campaigned over and over by the government to have negative effects on the smoker and the people around him. It has been found that passive smoke is riskier to the people around the smoker than the person actually smoking the cigarette. This means that if there is one smoker in an air-conditioned restaurant, all the other customers will suffer from the cigarette smoke more than the person smoking the cigarette. Therefore, it is vital to protect the health of its citizens and people of the country. Also, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because this banning can act as a deterrent to all the non-smokers. If it is completely banned at all restaurants, then non-smokers will know that if they were to start to smoke, then they will have no place to eat and smoke at the same time. This also shows them that the government is very serious about the issue of smoking and is taking measures to curb it. This will give the non-smokers who are considering smoking a second thought. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
