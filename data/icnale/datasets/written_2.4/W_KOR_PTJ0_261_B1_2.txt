They are more than 18 years old and it means they're legally adults who should avoid receiving a financial support from their parents and live by themselves. Some people think it is okay for college students to get help from parents because they're students whose main role is to study. Also, there are many parents who don't want their children to have part-time job since it is critical period for them to study, do many worthy things to write on their resume. Many students do part-time job to get money not for living their lives, but for buying things which are not basic stuff, like shopping or leisure. In this case, they waste their time twice more than other people on earning and spending money. For that reason many parents want them to spend their time in other things worthier than winning bread. To do part-time job is important, but to know the value of money and spend properly is more important. College students should know how hard it is to make money and learn how to spend their money properly and wisely. For this reason they should earn money although they're student. They can also learn how to spend limited budget and time wisely through doing part-time job before they become a real worker.
