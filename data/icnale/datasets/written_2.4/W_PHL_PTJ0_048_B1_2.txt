Students in high school and college take part-time jobs for a lot of reasons. It may possibly be for the needs of the students to earn a lot of money because of financial problems and so that they can pay fees for their schools. While other students need to work only to make their life easier; they wouldn't worry that much in purchasing a large amount for foods, school supplies, rents and bills especially if they earn a lot of money from their job. On the other side, some students work for part time jobs for what their pleasure needs; students can do and buy whatever they want when they have saved up enough money from their job, like purchasing belongings like clothing and gadgets or just to spend money for computer games, movies, concert or marathon tickets, vices, and etc. Students working for part-time job not just provide money, but it will also help them learn and improve their skills. Part-time job is also a preparation for teenagers for adult life. One preparation is communication skills. Students are more exposed into dealing with different people; it's a matter of how you are cautious and careful with your words and how you show respect to people. Another preparation is the importance of responsibility. Anything they do will be observed and assessed, so they tend to work harder and do their best in everything they do. And lastly, is learning how hard money is earned. It takes a lot of patience and hardwork to obtain a lot of money. Students must not take advantage of it and appreciate the value of money. Indeed, students who take part-time jobs not just only obtain money, they also obtain skills that can develop them into better employees in the future.
