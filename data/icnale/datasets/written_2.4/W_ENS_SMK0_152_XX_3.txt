Since I am a smoker myself, naturally I don't agree. It would be discrimination, pure and simple in my opinion and would go against my civil rights. I am a considerate smoker and will quite often go outside my own house to have a smoke so that I don't bother any visitors who maybe non-smokers. Since I have been to quite a lot of restaurants in Japan, I see an awful lot of Japanese people smoking too. Sometimes the air is a bit stale and the place doesn't smell very nice at all. I think that is just because of really bad or useless ventilation and also because some restaurants are so tiny that when there are too many smokers, it gets pretty bad. Having said that, it is my choice to smoke and a non-smokers' choice not to. If they are uncomfortable in an establishment that allows smoking, then either leave or just don't go there in the first place. I don't believe that it would be right to ban smoking in a business that does not belong to the government. We can all decide for ourselves without the need for any laws telling us what we can and can't do.
