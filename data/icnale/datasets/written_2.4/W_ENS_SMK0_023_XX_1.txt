I agree that smoking should be banned from many countries and also restaurants. This includes Japan. Smoking is really bad and can give you cancer in your lungs, throat, and other places. They really is very bad for you. Smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because it forces other people to smoke whether they want to or not. It is especially bad for young children whose bodies are not as resilient and strong as adults were even teenagers. One time I was at a party where everyone was smoking and the house was very smoky. I wasn't smoking myself, but the next day when I woke up, my throw hurt very badly and my eyes were very red. This goes to show that even though I'm not a smoker, other people who are smoking did something that may have affected my health. I don't think it's fair for people to make decisions about anyone other than themselves, and smoking like this is very rude to everyone around you. However, I do think that if they ban smoking at restaurants in Japan or any other places, they should give smokers a place where they can go to smoke freely and where they will not harm anyone, such as designated smoking areas.
