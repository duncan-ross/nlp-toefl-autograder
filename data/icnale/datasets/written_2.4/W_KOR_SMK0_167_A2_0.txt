I am a non smoker. And I very, very, very hate a smell of the smoke. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also I love to cook. If someone smoke in my beside when I cooking, I will kick his face. I specially think that cooking is very holy. If smoke invades cooking Oh, no! That is vet terrible. Today smokers are very many. High school students, middle school students, girls and woman even my dog too? I feel to the many smokers. Clearly I do not hate them. Just I don't understand them and I curse a smoking. But finally I have to admit to them. Because many various people exist in the world. But I tell that it is need to another smoking place for the both of smoker and non smoker. The restaurants are too. I imagine that smoking place out of restaurants. Then smoking is not damage for cooking. I can't oppose the smoking completely. Because I don't understand every people in the society. Someone also does not understand me. Society will to try to understand with each other. For happy life of everybody. I think that is the heaven in the earth.
