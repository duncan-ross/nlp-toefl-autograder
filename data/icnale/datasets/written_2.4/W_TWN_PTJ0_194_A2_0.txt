I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. One is that it can get some experiences and the experiences will help us in the future someday. For example, the way we treat the other people in the office or the guests, and some basic skills like computer program. And the post important is that it will train our attitude, let us be more social and be more like an adult. The other one is that only we earn the money by ourselves do we know how difficult it is, and will know the importance of storing money. I usually saw some college students using some expensive things, but the money of the things is they got from their parents. There is nothing wrong that parents give money to their children, but it's a big trouble that the children just know how to spend it but don't store the money and the difficulty of earning money. If children just spending money, one day they have to live by themselves, they will be very poor and cannot contain their life. So, standing in my shoes, I strongly agree that college students to have a part-time job. It's really good for us.
