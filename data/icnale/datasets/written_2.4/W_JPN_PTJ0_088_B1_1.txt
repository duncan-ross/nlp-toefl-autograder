I agree this subject. I think that it is important to have a part time job for college student. Because colleges are not only the place where we study but also the place where we grow to be adult. It is important to communicate many people for adult. However, colleges are closed. Because we spend many times with limited people. For example, teachers and a part of friends. Other hand, a person who has a part time job meet many people every day. In society, it happens many times that it is acquired communication ability than working ability. For example, the person who belongs a company must communicate his costomar and collegue every day. If he did not communicate them, he would be regarded as a bad employee. If he has a good ability for his job, this case will happen. So, less communication ability might be a handicapped for working. We students should take a communication many other people at young time. It is clearly that college students must study. But college students are not persons who only write a sentence and calcurate a question. College students should has identity and ability to survive in society. A part time job helps college students to have them.
