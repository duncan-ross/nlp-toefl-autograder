Smoking is bad for health. Nearly all smokers know this fact. However it is unfair for non-smokers to be subjected to the same ill-effects of smoking via second hand smoke. Some restaurants try to segregate non-smokers and smokers into different sections in the restaurants. However, not everyone on the same table in the smoking section smokes. Hence, it is unfair to subject these innocent non-smokers to a torturous meal. A restaurant is a place to eat. Although one might argue that one should be able to smoke whenever he pleases, another person in the restaurant might not enjoy having the aroma of their food mixing with the smell of smoke. Smokers need to be considerate of others as it is only fair for everyone in the restaurant to enjoy their food without the need to endure smoke. Smokers can leave the restaurant and smoke outside if the urge arises. It is therefore ethically correct for smokers not to smoke at all in a restaurant. As for the condition completely banned, I disagree with it. Smoking is not a crime. For smokers who want to smoke, restaurants must be considerate in providing a smoking room in the restaurant. Hence, I conclude that smoking should not be completely banned in restaurants.
