Part-time job, which was virtually known as a waste of time, has now become a vital part of college students' life. An increasing population of college students spend their leisure time being involved in several part-time jobs. It can be concluded three more reasons to explain this prevailing phenomenon. Experience is so precious for college students. In campus, students can't put them into a real social surroundings which truly tell them how hard to live in the city. They regard it as a good test of their capacity and make sufficient preparation for their future.. Personally, college students want to behave independently through this to prove that they are an adult. Students are supposed to be faced with more challenges in interpersonal relationship. What matters is not part-time job itself but a practice of economic and even mentally independence I think. In universities, part-time job gradually has been an index of college students' social practice performance. So it is no wonder why more and more students have a part-time job. It is encouraged. To summarize, part-time jobs function as a bridge to link the universities with society. It is truly important for college students to have a part-time job. Actually, the benefit is mutual. Now, a great variety of stores and companies receive college students. They provide them opportunity to work while finding good human resources for themselves.
