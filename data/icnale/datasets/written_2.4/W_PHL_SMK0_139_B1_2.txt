Smoking in Restaurants should be Prohibited Food is one of the basic needs of an individual in order to survive. One way to satisfy this need is through restaurant which prepares and serves food and drinks to people. But nowadays, some of the restaurants in the country are not only for eating, it become also a place where people are free in smoking which should not be tolerated because smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazzard. We all know that smoking has several effects on human health which are serious and in many cases, deadly. First, the ingredients in cigarettes can cause internal malfunctioning of organs up to the inefficiency of the body's immune system when somebody inhaled the smoke of it. Those who inhale second-hand smoke on a regular basis have the same risks as smokers. Moreover, there's also a cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) in tobacco smoke that damage important genes that control the growth of cells, causing them to grow abnormally or to reproduce too rapidly. Furthermore, smoking may also increase the risk for respiratory infections when the smoke is inhaled. Lastly, it can affect the impression of every customer towards the restaurant, because cleanliness and proper hygiene is very important component in attracting more consumers. Some people give more importance on the cleanliness than the quality of food. That's why I strongly believe that smoking in public places especially in all restaurants in the counrty should be banned.
