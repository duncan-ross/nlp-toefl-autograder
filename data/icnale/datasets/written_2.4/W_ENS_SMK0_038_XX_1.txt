Whether or not they ban smoking at restaurants in Japan, it would be beneficial if they took a look at Colorado because we have banned smoking in our restaurants since around 2003. When this topic was up for debate in our state, there were a lot of people who felt that if we banned smoking indoors, it would impinge upon the rights of smokers. However, after only a few years, smokers have gotten used to it, and now they have no problem stepping outside when they need to have a smoke. In Japan, I think the situation might be similar. At the moment, there are lots of smokers who do not want to have to change their habits or the ways in which they enjoy life, for example, at restaurants. However, if they outlaw smoking at Japanese restaurants, this will be better for the health of other people in the restaurants, and the smokers themselves will get used to this new way of life in only a year or so. Whether or not banning smoking indoors really is an infringement of freedom or not, I don't know, but I do think that no matter the nature of this object, it is not appropriate to affect the health of other people buying continuing to smoke around those who do not want to.
