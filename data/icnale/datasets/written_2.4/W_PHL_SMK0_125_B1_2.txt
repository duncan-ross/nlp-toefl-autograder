I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because as we observe nowadays that smoking is widely practiced by billions of people out there and as concern citizen of my country I think that prohibiting of smoking in restaurants is a way of minimizing or helping other smokers to quit their hobby. Aside from that we all know that smoking is very dangerous to our health, even you are not a smoker once you inhaled the nicotine it has also an effect to you especially for those people who are sensitive or the asthmatic. smoking has different side effects. Even if it feels good and cool to the smoker they didn't noticed that they are killing there selves. One of the most possible causes of using cigarette is lung cancer, heart problem, skin diseases and aside from the bad effects to their health they contribute to air pollution that can cause also global warming. Aside from that it also annoys some customers because their foods and clothes get stinks like cigarette. Some says that it should not be banned because it can cause a loss to the business but as far as I know there are some restaurants here in our country which smoking is prohibited but still they have a good circulation of business. I think it depends only how they handled their business and if you are going to see the positive side of it, it is one of the simplest way to discipline people and gave importance to their health
