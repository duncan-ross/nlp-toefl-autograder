I agree to the following statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country to a certain extent. In this century, I believe that human rights should be implace and humans ought to choose the way they want to live in. Hence, smoking should not be banned completely even though it is harmful as maybe what the government can do is to impose a yellow box or a smoking chamber in the restaurant premises itself, or to allocate a 10meter radius away from the non smoking population. Also, the government should encourage restaurants to state if they are a smoking or non smoking restaurant for consumers to choose whether they want to go to a smoking or non smoking one to consume their food. In other countries such as Malaysia, restaurants are opened air and they allowed smokers to smoke in the premises. However, seldom air conditioned restaurants will allow the smokers to smoke inside as it will definitely smoke the whole area up and the place will be very choky. Unless the restaurant's owner is willing to purchase some good exhaust fans to direct the smoke away from the area then it will be feasible.
