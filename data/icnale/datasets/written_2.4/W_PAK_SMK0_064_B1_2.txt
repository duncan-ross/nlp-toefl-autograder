People come in the restaurants for amusement and enjoyment. They come for heaving healthy food in a healthy envoirment. Smoking is a serious issue of time nowadays. Its smoke is very dangerous and harmful for our health. Tjis smoke which contains many anti health chemicals and are responsible for lung's cancer and other disorders related to breathing system. So, it shows that it is very unhealthy activity. In restaurant, there should be healthy atmosphere. All should be clean and pure. So that people come there again and again for having comfort and enjoyment and a healthy bread and butter. But smoking is really injurious to health. It smoke not only effect the person who is having a ciggerate but also to the person who is sitting near to him. This smoke mined in air and air becomes polluted. When the people sitting in the restaurant are breathing they take in that polluted air and as a result their lungs are contaminated with this harmful smoke. This is what smoking is giving, nothing but only cancer and other infection. So, I agree that smoking should be strictly banned in restaurants so, that health of people can maintained and their life can be secured.
