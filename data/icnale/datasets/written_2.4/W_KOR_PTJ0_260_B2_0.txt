I do not agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job. First of all, the college is the last moment in their lives where the students can enjoy their identity of being a student. It is unnecessary to experience what they will experience after the graduation so early. There are a lot of things that college students can do, the things that only students can do, such as going to an exchange program, participating in a club or acting and so much more. There is not enough time for all these, therefore it is not recommended to college students to have a part-time job. Secondly, their primary role is students, which means all their attention and focus should be paid toward studying. In order to fulfill their role as students and pay the full attention to studying, working a part-time job is not recommendable. If students need money for their tuition fees, it is much worthy to study hard and get a scholarship, which can be a plus to their future careers. Working a part-time job exhausts them and takes their time for studying. Therefore, it is not recommendable to college students to have a part-time job.
