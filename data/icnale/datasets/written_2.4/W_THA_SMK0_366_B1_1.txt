I agree with this topic. I'll be happy very much if it possible. In fact it is very hard to stop people who smoke in the restaurant. I really hate the cigarette. Someone's smoking in the public area. "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country" it's a great idea. They should where you can smoking and can't smoke. I think smoking should be banned in all public area. The movement should set or support many smoking area. And don't banned only restaurants but should be "All public please" include the university. Many students now smoke a lot and they smoke everywhere. The most smokers disturb people around them and not good for healthy. Most restaurants have a lot of smokers so it impossible for changed. People who eating will be very happy and they don't be afraid to have lung cancer from smoking. It is just not fair that we go the restaurant and want to eat but we may upset when we smell the cigarette. Me too! I want to throw water to the cigarette but I can't. if they want to smoke in the restaurant they should go outside so people in the restaurant will eat happily. So, it should be banned in all public areas not only restaurant.
