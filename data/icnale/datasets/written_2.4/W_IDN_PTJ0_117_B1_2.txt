A college students mostly is a teenagers that going to be an adult. They like hangout, clubbing, shopping, buy all the things they want, have fun all the time. As a matter of fact, that is college student life style in this era. We can see that all their activity needs money, a lot of money. And that is not fair if they just say to their parents "mom, I need money", mom give me much money, and then they spend it all just one night. So, college student must have a part-time job I think. At least help in their family business. But if they can have his/her own business, that's better. They don't need to open a boutique or shop, it need a lot of money again for first assets. They can sell by door to door, like offering that product to their friends and their lecture if they want. The product can from clothes to food. They can collect some money from their small business (actually I don't know, maybe the business be the biggest business in this country someday). And they can feel free to spent their money, and of course make their parents proud. Okay college student, let's do something.
