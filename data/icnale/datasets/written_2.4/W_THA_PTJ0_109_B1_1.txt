It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I'm agreeing with this topic. I think we must help our parents about money maybe we can work for keep our budget for pay to everything you want to buy. We could spend the time for do something good in our vacation or when the semester close such as to be the seller in some shop, working with our parents business, or to be serving woman in the restaurants. If we are doing like that, we will receive the money and the experience and you can use your money for shopping or doing something whatever you want with your own money. Although the part-time job is good, but I think we should do it when we have time or long vacation only. I am not supporting about work while study because we must concentrate with the lesson more than the work as studying is our responsibility, even though it good to help your parents about the money and it is good to have the experience, but you could know that what time you could spend for the job or what time you could spend for learning. It will be worst, if you abandon your learning for keeping the money because the education is very important than the money.
