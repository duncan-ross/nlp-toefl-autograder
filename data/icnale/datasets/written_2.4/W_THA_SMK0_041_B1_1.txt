No matter the smokers will be kids or adults, smoking can cause the cancer for them and also heart disease. Nowadays, there are a lot of people try to smoke, and some of them addicted tobacco. On the streets, there are many tobaccos on sale and there are many flavor. Because of some tasty tobaccos, people loves to smoke and don't care about people who don't smoke. In the restaurants, there are also many kids, woman, and non smokers. If smokers keep smoking in that place, it seems that all people in that place are smoking because all of them smell the smoke already. The smoke also affect to the environment and people health damage. All smokers should care about other people who do not smoke. However, if they can stop smoking, they will have a good health. No one can do for themselves, they have to start from their own. So I agree if the restaurants do not allow people to smoke. It's not only save people in the restaurants, it saves the restaurants to be good place for non smoking area too. Besides, people will enjoy eating food and have fun time in the restaurants that no people smoking in that area.
