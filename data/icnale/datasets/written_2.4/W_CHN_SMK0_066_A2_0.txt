Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? My answer is that it depends. To begin with, it is not good to smoke in public especially in the restaurant. What do you think if you take a mass of smoke from other tables when you are enjoying your meal at the restaurant? Restaurant is a place where people should obey the public morality. As we enjoy the personal liberty, we ought to respect other people's rights and not to harm their rights. If you do not, you will suffer from others' disgusted look and public blame. In addition, some people cannot help themselves smoking in the restaurants. It will harm not only the smoker's health but also other's health. It is not fair for other non-smokers stay in the same restaurant. On the contrary, smoking is a personal habit and liberty. And everyone's legal liberty should be protected. People can get relaxed and release themselves from smoking. Those who have a hobby of smoking will be unsatisfied if there is a law to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants. To solve the problem, we can do other thing. In my opinion, smoking and non-smoking areas can be set in the restaurants so that both smokers and non-smokers can enjoy themselves.
