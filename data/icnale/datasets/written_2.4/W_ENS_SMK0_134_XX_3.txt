I agree and it should have been done a long time ago. I think there have to be some places where people can smoke though, just not public places. Smoking should be limited to designated areas or at the very least, away from those that don't smoke and the young and elderly. I understand that there is a democracy in Japan and that all citizens have rights. I would add that those rights also extend to people who don't smoke and especially children who are not only easily influenced when they see their peers smoking but are also still developing and do not always have a choice as to the kind of air that they breathe in. I feel that it is high time that all governments and not only Japan played a more aggressive role in cleaning up the air that we breathe on a daily basis. We see and hear about many environmental concerns ranging from industrial to household wastage yet there are thousands of smokers exhaling contaminated smoke into the air everyday which we hear less about. Smoking endangers not only smokers, but those who choose to live a smoke free existence as well. Japan should not only issue a restaurant ban, but a complete smoking ban in all public places including parks, which is where most people go to get some fresh air and exercise.
