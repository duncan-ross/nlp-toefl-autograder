These are advertisements to announce the job. I think they will be interested by unemployed or person who would like to get more earnings. I was interested once time when I aspired something and I need to buy by myself. So I asked my uncle for permission, he rejected me. I have canceled my attention to part time job. He told me that I should attend only in my class. But my older brother can do! My older brother did a part time job at Mcdonald's, he enjoyed his job. At the beginning he complained about his job and he looked so tired. Later he had narratives, he told me daily. I listened him, I feel so fun, too. And he talked to foreign in work. That's great experience for him to develop his language. I think the reasons for doing part time job other than getting the earning are finding more experience by own self and using the free time in good way. I see a lot of advantages from part time job despite I ever haven't done it. If I work in part time, I will got various things: the earnings, experience from own self and other people, friendship from workmates. I just want a chance to try to do something by myself.
