I think college students should have a part-time job for several reasons. First of all; they are different from the others because they have more experiences in their life. Working job has many problems to solve. If they can find out, it means they have a step to learn the meaning of life. Second, they may save family expenses. It is fact that part-time job make a little money but it can help their parents to pay expenses in the house. Third, it can help them to know the valve of money. If they have a part-time job, they will realize the difficulty to get money. Maybe they will spend less money because of this. Finally, if they have a part-time to do, they do not have time do bed thing, for example, addicted the drug, drink alcohol, smoking etc. Fourth, the part time job give college student to know to adjust oneself because in the work have a many people who is relate to this job. If you don't adjust oneself maybe the job can't good. For many reasons above. I really agree with College students ought to have a part-time job. At least they can help their family to save the cost of living.
