The prohibition of smoking in all the restaurants is an increasingly severe topic in the current society. Some people assert that it is reasonable for advocating the healthy life style, guaranteeing the environment of the public place and the other reasons. Admittedly, these opinions are true to some degree because sometimes smoking is not appropriate in some occasions like formal partys. However, I still think this rule is too absolute. First of all, whether to smoke is an individual's basic rights. He or she can choose to smoke based on its own desire, limited to nothing. Just like I said before, it is true that sometimes we should ban the smoking in some occasions. Nevertheless, it is unreasonable to forbid smoking completely at all the restaurants. Secondly, cigarette is useful in the many places. For instance, when a business man negotiate with another in a restaurant and they are both smokers, it is unavoidable to smoke during the negotiation. As we know, the mind of people benefits from smoking. So it is absolutely wrong to rule it in this situation. Finally,. smoking when having dinner is a traditional habit in China, according to the custom. People are used to smoke and offer cigarettes to others, showing the friendship and generosity. In conclusion, even smoking should not be advocated for its harm to people's health, it is still absurd to prohibit the smoking totally at all the restaurants.
