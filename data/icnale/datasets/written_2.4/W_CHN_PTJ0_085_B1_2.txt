 As we all know, some of the college students have or are finding a part-time job, like waiters, leafleteers, and shop assistants and so on. Some people think it is important, but some think it is just a waste of time. But I don't think some think part-job can be a major to us college students. First of all, and it is obvious that take a part-job can we have more money before we take it. We are college students, not middle school or high school students, and we are adults already. It's time for us to make money, maybe not all by ourselves but part of. And in the other words, we can reduce the heavy burdens that our parents take on their no longer broad shoulders. So that is about the money, and secondly, take a part-time job can also improve our ability. Maybe money is not that count for some person, but abilities is necessary. No matter what work you will do in the future, one thing that you must have various abilities. Something likes communications in all kinds of occasions. And as a college student who has more free time to do what he/she likes, I think take a part-time job can we have a rich life in university. Just think about it, what we can win only from playing computer games and surf the Internet, and then what we will achieve from a meaningful part-time job. Above all I have said, I think it is important and necessary for us to take a part-time job.
