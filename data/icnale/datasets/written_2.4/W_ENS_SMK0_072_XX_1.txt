I don't think that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan. Even in the U. S., I feel that there is a much better solution to the smoking problem although I have to admit that I don't know exactly what it is yet. All I know is that there are some people who will be impacted by the decision to ban smoking in restaurants that would not be happy. The best solution is always a solution which makes both people happy, and in this situation the best solution would be a solution that can make both smokers and nonsmokers happy. Smoking and nonsmoking areas do not seem to be satisfactory because the nonsmokers complain that smoke will still go to their side of the restaurant. Banning smoking in restaurants is not satisfactory to the smokers who would like to enjoy tobacco products during their meal. To them, it is a big part of the dining experience to skillfully choose a good tobacco to have after the meal, at least for smokers who are serious about their tobacco like me. I think that everyone should be patient and allow a little bit more time to pass on this issue before we make any rash decisions that will be difficult to undo. If smoking becomes banned at restaurants, I think that it will probably be much harder for it to become unbanned, so we should take our time and make sure we do everything right the first time.
