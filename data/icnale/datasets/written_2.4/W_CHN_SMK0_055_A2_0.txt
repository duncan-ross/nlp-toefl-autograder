Sitting in front of the table, people hold a great mood to enjoy their meals. What if a great deal of blue smoke from other table enters into their noses? They will feel extremely disgusted by that. So many people protest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I partly support this demand. On the one hand, smoking not only breaks down people themselves' health, but also hurts other people's bodies. Take one couple for example; a wife breathed too much second-hand smoke while her husband smoked crazily about 20 years every day. After half a year, the wife died from lung cancer. So if a person goes to restaurant every day and then there are a great number of people smoking around him, what will happen to this poor person? Of course, the people who smoked a lot will never free from disease unless he or she is really lucky. But on the other hand, I think reasonable smoking is not so bad for our health only if smokers can control the intensity of smoking. That is a little smoking can relieve people' pressure and make them feel relaxed. Our present lives run up too fast, more and more stress deposits several layers of stones in people's hearts, especially males. So a little smoking can be chosen from people to give off their burdens while being in a restaurant to enjoy meals. Take these two factors into consideration, smoking should be controlled but not completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
