When I am in restaurant, I can usually smell that someone is smoking but I can't say anything at all, and many people have the same feeling as me, so many people think the government should publish a law to ban smoking in restaurant, I have a mixed idea about it. It is obvious that people smoking will influence the people around him. But we can ban completely smoking in restaurant as a people not smoking; we should consider the feeling of people smoking. First, we can build a special room in restaurant for people to smoke, the idea will meet people's need of smoking and the smoke will not influence people's dinner. Before the special room being built, people can smoke in toilet or beside the junk barrel. After the law being published, if any people smoke in the restaurant and influence the other people's eating, in restaurant, the waiter should advise them to go to the special room for smoking politely and if the smokers are rude and continue to smoke influencing other people, waiter can reveal the law to them for money. Generally speaking, the smoker can smoke in the restaurant, but they should smoke in the toilet or special room and guarantee they will not influence other people.
