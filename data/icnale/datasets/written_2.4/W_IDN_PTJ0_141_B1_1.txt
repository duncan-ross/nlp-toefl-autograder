Student in majority in my class are having part time job include me. Based on our focus in the department of education especially in English. We prefer to have part time job by being a teacher, either teach in formal course or in informal course. It means that we spend a part of our time to teach. Some students, beside we still have obligation as a student of college. Sometime, we are too tired to do a lot of activities day by day. But we must see other side of our activities. It is true that as I explained before, we have to study different material with ours in the college. In other words, it consume a lot of our time, not only we have to prepare a lot of things to teach, but also we need more time and energy. Furthermore, if we see another side, we will get positive side. For instance we have remained our material in the last level it will be our preparation to be a real teacher in the future. Other advantage is we will get income by our selves, certainly we will feel satisfied because of our effort. To contrast, personally I disagree with having other part time job which are consuming our time and getting salary only. To illustrate this being a shopkeeper or sales, it just give us salary without positive influence to our study. Unfortunately, I am in the education department so I can prefer to have part time job which is beneficial to my study such as being a teacher because the important thing we have to manage our times as efficient as possible and we will not get a bad effect of our part time activities.
