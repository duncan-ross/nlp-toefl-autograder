Apart from improving students' employability after graduation, it will certainly help improve their financial situation. They would also learn more about budgeting, take some financial responsibility and basically improve or should I say that it would give them the opportunity to improve their money handling skills. On a personal level, it would give them a sense of worth and accomplishment, give them confidence and help shape their character in a positive way. If students find that they are working in a less than ideal part-time job than what they aspire to after graduation, the lessons learnt will give them an appreciation for and be grateful for what they have when the eventually graduate and attain the job they desire. A humbling experience I'm sure, but still a valuable experience to carry with them for the rest of their working lives. When I was in college, I was actually working two part-time jobs, one was as a clerk in the local drug store and the other was washing dishes and cleaning up slops in the college cafeteria. I was grateful for the opportunity and the cash and it also allowed me to do many things that I wouldn't have been able to do without earning some extra dollars.
