I agree with the topic B. There are a lot of smoke-free areas at restaurants, cafes, movie theatre, and pubs in many countries. Some countries hold that smoking in public places should be forbidden by law for people's health, while others insist that people have the rights to smoke even in public places in terms of freedom, economic effects, and overestimated data. However, smoking should be banned in public places all over the world since passive smoking could cause serious health problems and the policy prohibiting smoking in public places could help smokers reduce or quit smoking, enhance performance in workplaces and be helpful in terms of economic effects and the people's rights. Many non-smokers think that the government should ban smoking in restaurant because there restaurant-smoking have lots of side effects. It is involved to danger of secondhand smoke, harms of appearance of restaurants and environment, and desires of people. Think! How would you feel if a person smokes a cigarette beside you? You might feel unpleasant. If you are a smoker, you won't agree with it, but you are a non-smoker, you would agree with it. Smoking in public restaurants has a lot of negative effects, so many non-smokers insist on their right to breathe clean air and to be protected from smoking-related diseases. Smoking in public restaurants has to be prohibited by law.
