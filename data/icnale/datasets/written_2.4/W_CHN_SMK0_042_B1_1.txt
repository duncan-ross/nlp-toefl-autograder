 Whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is always a hot topic among these years. And many European countries and America just have passed the law about smoking is not permitted in public places. Obviously, China has a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking, especially young boys and girls, some of them even are middle school students. No matter how harmful to smokers themselves. Nonsmokers argue that second-hand smoke is much more harmful to their health. It can cause cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases. As for me, I support this issue. Smoking poses health risks for both smokers and non-smokers. And research has found that second-hand smoke is as dangerous to non-smokers as first-hand smoke is to smokers. But nothing is absolute; I think all the restaurants can set an area for those smokers. We should protect their rights to smoke after all. And in fact smoking is just becoming a culture. Every country has it own smoking cultures. So completely banned smoking at all restaurants is not practical. Everything has two sides, smoking is also like this. So we can't say completely banned that smoking at all the restaurants, but to say that we can set a specific area for smokers. So that both smokers and nonsmokers can enjoy their meal and have a great joy during the meal.
