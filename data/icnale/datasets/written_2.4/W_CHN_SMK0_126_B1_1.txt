There are still a lot of people smoking nowadays, though it is obviously harmful not only to the smoker's health but also to the nonsmokers'. When a cigarette is fired, it releases much harmful gases. Also cigarettes contain a lot of chemicals which are poisonous enough to make the smokers be ill. They could get diseases such as lung diseases, cancer and so on. What's more, smoking will damage the smokers' beauty because one's teeth will become yellow when smoking regularly. So except the damage to the body, nothing will it bring to the smokers. Aside from the damages to the smokers, it also does harm to the non smokers who are called second-hand smokers. The second-hand smokers breathe the smoke unconsciously. But they breathe into the harmful chemicals after all. And these chemicals will bring more damages to the nonsmokers than to the smokers.
