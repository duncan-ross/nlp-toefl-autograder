Yes. I agree that college student should have a part time job. As a student, they need to study to get good grades, but at the same time, they also need to be exposed to the outside world meaning that they should take up job be it part time or full time. This will give them some working experience in terms of how they interact with people professionally and how to solve critical problem in a short period of time when they encounter with problems during their work. Firstly taking up a part time job during school holiday can help the student to spend their time quickly and meaningfully instead of doing nothing at home or hanging out with bad company. Secondly, it will help the student relieve stress, as I believe that most college students study day to night. Thirdly, the students can earn some incomes from taking up this part time job, and can spend their own money freely at will, instead of asking from their parents which I believe some parents will control their children expenditure to prevent them from spending money wildly. It will also help those students whose families are financially instable. Lastly it will allow students to realize that earning money wasn't easy as they think this may make them develop a habit of saving and being thrifty.
