I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants. Patrons of restaurants consist of family members of all ages, from toddlers to elderly folks on a regular basis. It is also a known health fact that second hand smoke is more fatal and detrimental than first hand smoke. Hence, the smoker in the restaurant would only bring harm to the most vulnerable in the population. Both the toddlers and the elderly have particularly sensitive and weak respiratory systems that are easily agitated by the smoke that is produced. Apart from the health hazards, smoking in itself makes the restaurant an unpleasant place to dine in comfortably. Not only does it make the place smoky, the smell of the smoke in itself is intolerable for most if not all of the young and old people who patronize the restaurants. Also, the fact that the restaurants customers include teenagers and youths would also support the stance that smoking should be banned in restaurants. Smokers pose as a negative influence for the teenagers and youths who are around them. Youths, being at a stage where their self-identity is formed through the molding by their surroundings, risk being taught that smoking at the dinner table should be tolerable.
