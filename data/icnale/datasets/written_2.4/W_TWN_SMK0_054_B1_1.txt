I strongly disagree this kind of point. It is not because I am a smoker, because I believe every person has the rights, for decided whether they smoke, on the other side, they also have the right to against the secondhand smoke. And the premise is "Respect", smokers respect non-smokers, non-smokers respect smokers. This thing should be based on the human nature, not based on the law. Think, when you are smoking outside, you see children around you, if you are a well-manner person, you must stop smoking, but the law declares that you could smoke outside, then what will you do? Will you keep smoking? The declaration of the law is not reasonable. And, some coffee shop or pub is open at night, there's no child in it at that time, even if the day, why people could not smoke inside the restaurant? In fact lot of restaurant are friendly to smokers, even the host is smoker, too. I think the host has the right to decide whether his/her restaurant could smoke. And I think the function of the law is to protect human rights, but before the law there's humanity, and the law should not be controlled by government or financial group.
