Smoking should be banned in all public places. A smoking has affect the health of others. The smoker lead to detrimental health condition are very much so present to society. Many people could die so stop smoking. The smoker may cause cancer. I think that we should not be smoking in public place because many people can cause from fume smoke. I never to smoke cigarettes because smoking is harmful for other people. Although the person who smokes also get the harmful, but the person who smells. Smoking a non- smoking, should there be a choice? Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy a meal due to the cloud of smoke coming from neighbor's table. The fact that there was not a designated area for smokers has put the smoker and non- smoker in an uncomfortable situation. Smoking should be banned in public places because non- smoker have a night to clean air and because the cloud of smoking is more dangerous than actually smoking a cigarette. However, smoking should not be banned in public places because it is the smoker's choice to smoke just us it is the non- smokers choice not to smoke I think smoking should be banned in all public place is that is unpleasant to non- smoker.
