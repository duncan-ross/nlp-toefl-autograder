In Canada, there is a law that smoking is banned in buildings. When I was there, I didn't feel bad because of smoking. However I realized that it is really annoying that someone next to me is smoking in the restaurant. I strongly agree with this statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There are two reasons for my argument. Second hand smoking is really bad for health. Different from outside, inner space is closed so dirty air will be stopped in a restaurant. It will make people's health in the restaurant worse. Moreover there must be non smokers who really hate smoking smell. Smokers should respect their right. As a smoker wants to smoke, non smoker doesn't want to smell it. They can smoke out of the restaurant. Another reason is it can make a restaurant unhygienic. Ashes from smoking can be spread and ruined dishes or drinks. It can also ruin taste of other costumers because of smoking smell. Reputation of the restaurant can be affected by smoking. Overall it is bad to customers, owner and smoker themselves. In conclusion, smoking should be banned because of the reasons for health and hygienic. Smokers should know they can smoke out of a restaurant, not in the restaurant. If they realize their smoking habit is harmful for others, it will be easy to smoke not in buildings
