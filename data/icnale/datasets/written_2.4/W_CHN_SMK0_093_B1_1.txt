I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons:There is some nicotine that is something poisonous in cigarettes, so smoking has a bad effect on health. Because of this, law says that cigarette case have to show smoking is harmful to health. But there are so many smokers. Why? Although cigarette is bad for health, it brings benefits for people. For example, when you are tired after a long day's work, maybe smoking a cigarette can help you have a good rest. And when you are anxiety, it can calm you down quickly. So many people know the harm of smoking, they smoke yet. Even somebody take smoking as a habit. But smoking will not only affect smokers, but also affect people around smokers. So it is necessary to respect smokers' power and habit and to ensure the health of others. So I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, we can set up a smoking area and some language tips in all restaurants. In this way, we can ensure smokers and non-smokers' power and benefits at the same time.
