I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country, but it should be controlled at all the restaurants in the country. The restaurants should provide the place for smoking because the smoke from smoking disturbs the other customer if the restaurants do not provide the place for smoking, but if the smoking is completely banned anyone who addict smoking may be unhappy with lack of smoking and make them unhappy with dining. So I think it is good idea to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. There are a lot of people who addict smoking in the country. In present not only the men but women addict smoking also and the number of person who addict smoking is rising every year so it is bad idea to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Banning may lead to losing of business. the smoking problem should not solve with complete banning, it should solve with preventing access cigarette of person who have not addicted smoking yet. And it should have more intermediary to show demerit of smoking.
