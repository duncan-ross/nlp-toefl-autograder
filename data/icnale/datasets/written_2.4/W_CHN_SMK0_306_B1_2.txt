 Nowadays, too many people are absorbed in smoking, they can't help to smoke in public places. This phenomenon has already become a hot topic in society. Some people think it doesn't matter to smoke in public places, because each citizen has his or her right to do what he or she wants. But I think it should be forbidden. Smoking in public places is not only a thing of your own, you may disturb others. If there is a person with lung disease nearby, and you light the cigarettes one by one, you may do a very bad thing to him or her. On the other hand, many smokers always leave cigarette ends around, it's really bad to our environment and public tidy. When I visited Shanghai Expo Park with my parents, we saw some smoking areas. As we know, Shanghai Expo Park got together more than 200 thousands visitors all over the world each day. So everything in it might show our culture to the world. Since people didn't smoke here and there, the air in the park is clean and the environment is pretty. We showed to the world that China was a polite country. We Chinese are all proud of our own. At the same time, smokers had no need to suffer from the strong feeling that they want to smoke, they could go to the smoking area to do what they wanted. It's humanized. It can kill two birds with one stone. The conclusion is smoking in public places should be forbidden, while some special areas should be set up. Let's make our life better together.
