The Toss of the Coin If one side of the coin can brand you, which side would you be? In a world where almost every little thing is given attention and judged, it is not hard to imagine how even people themselves, are classified into small groups and niches. No matter how much equality is empowered and believed in, there will always be differences between culture, status, religion, nationality, race, colour, and possibly, every characteristic a person can be grouped into. There is always this barrier of contrasts and somehow, it has even reached and now resides within the four walls of each and every school. Students are easily categorized into two— the elite and rich kids, and the scholars. The wealthy ones are usually in good schools and can afford not only their needs but also their luxuries in life. They are dependent on their parents so they don't really have to work too hard to finish school. All they have to focus on are their studies. On the other hand, there are those students who hardly even have enough money for all the things they need. They are those who have to work their way up to graduation and yet things won't still be enough. Most often than not, they need to take part time jobs just so they can continue with their studies and finish college. It is not important whether one is rich or one is poor. No one should be branded. Whether a student finishes college because of working part time or not is not the real question to ask. What truly matters is that he attains his goals, reaches his dreams, and makes a difference. So whether you choose tails or heads, it doesn't really count much. Question is do you win the game?
