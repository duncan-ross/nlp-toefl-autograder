I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. And I have a part-time job. I have three reasons about it. First, college students need much money to play with their friends and to eat lunch by their selves, to travel around the world and so on. College students are free compared to other people, and they have a lot of time. So college students can do many things. So college students use a lot of money to do many things. Second we can know a lot of work of kind. We can work a lot of work as part-time job. So it helps that we decide to select works in future. Third we can get personal connection. The number that we can meet people in our college is limited. And the number that we can get chances to meet other college student is few. So we can meet a lot of people with having a part-time job. And men who we meet at part-time jobs are a lot of kinds of people. They are different for sex, old, employment state, and so on. So we can study social statement along working as part-time jobs. That is why I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
