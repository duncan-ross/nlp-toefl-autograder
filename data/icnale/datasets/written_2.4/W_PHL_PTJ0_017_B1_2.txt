Nowadays, the tuition fees of college students were getting higher. Some student even joined rallies because of this. They fight to decrease the tuition fees. Many of them wanted to study but they cannot because they lack the money to pay. Some of them can pay their tuition fees but wanted to lessen their parents ' worries. Since not all college students can join these rallies, they just apply for part-time jobs to help their parents with their expenses. I remember my sister's friend. She was a college student and she already graduated now. During her college years, she had to work part-time in McDonald's so she could continue her education. She worked there until she graduated as a Certified Public Accountant. Because of her part-time job she was able to graduate in college. There are also other reasons for having part-time job aside from education. College students will be able to help their parents in other expenses like the primary needs of the family like food, clothes and shelter. They learn values that they can use in their lives after college. Also, they earn experiences that other won't have. They can use it while applying in companies or other business. It could be their advantage to others. Having a part time job is not really that important but to those who have money crisis, it is a must. They must work hard to have a better future for themselves and their families. This is the only way they could achieve their dreams with flying colors and without doing the wrong thing.
