Today, many restaurants in Japan separate Smoking seat and No-smoking seat, so when we enter restaurant, clerk ask Smoking seat or no-smoking seat? That's show some people, like me hate cigarette's smoking, smell, and so on. However, will this measure of the restaurant be really effective? In many cases, partition between these seats is plastic, glass board etc and smoke cannot be completely intercepted. Besides, air-conditioner carries unpleasant wind to no-smoking seat. With this, Non smoker cannot enjoy themselves enough over meal. Almost all of people know smoking is not good for human body. In addition to this, secondhand smoke is worse than firsthand smoke. What an irrational thing this is! Smoking in the public place will not be an exaggeration to say pollution. For the nonsmoker, if smoke drifts in the store, a special meal is spoiled. We go to restaurant for eating, not to take smoke of others' cigarettes. In Japan, it already tends to exclude smoking. For instance, the regulation that prohibits the walking cigarette is made, and the price hike of the tax is examined. Tobacco is said that There are 100 harms and an advantage none. It is glad that the chance to breathe in the smoke of the cigarette decreases.
