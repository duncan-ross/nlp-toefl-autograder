 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Almost at every place even at school, we could see some persons smoking. Sometimes, we can ignore the smokers; after all, they are not smoking near us. But what if they smoke in public just in the restaurants? In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In the first place, the smokers themselves are the most direct victims of smocking. As is known to us all, cigarettes contains a kind of material called nicotine which will do harm to human bodies, especially to the smokers themselves. Moreover, the harmful smoke will also have an indirect bad effect on those around the smokers. In addition, restaurant is a public place for people to have their meals. And all the individuals in the restaurants need a clean and comfortable environment. Let's say, someone smokes when you are having you dinner, what reaction will you have? I'm sure you will be angry and ask the impolite smoker to stop smoking or smoke somewhere else. Besides, there's no doubt that smoking in public can cause a dilemma situation between you and your companions. To conclude, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It will decrease the risk of harm the health both of smokers themselves and people around. At the same time, it also contributes to making a quiet, clean and comfortable atmosphere in public.
