Nowadays, many students have a part-time job. They do the part-time jobs not because they can't afford the tuition or their living expenses but they want more money so that they can buy more luxurious things they want. I don't much agree to have a part-time job. There are three following consequences if they have a part-time job. First, for college students, take our major for example, we have lots of projects to do. Accidentally, for some subjects, even if we don't have so much homework to do, we need lots of practice to understand. So if we have part-time job, we can't pay attention on the works and studying. Basically, it's easy to get bad grades and fail the subjects as well. Second, making friends is important. In order to maintain a good relationship with friends, we have to spend time with them. However, if we work too much, our friends may leave us away. The last, there are many clubs and campaigns in college. Attend clubs and campaigns, we can learn many things as well as make more friends. For those who spend much time on part-time job, they can't participate in these activities. To enjoy the life in college and learn more things you can't learn after leaving the college, and if you have enough money, just don't spend too much time on working. We will have more time to work after we graduate isn't it?
