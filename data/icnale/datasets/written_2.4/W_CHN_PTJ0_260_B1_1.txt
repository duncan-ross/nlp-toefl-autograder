 Absolutely, it is necessary. There are many advantages for us who take part-time jobs. First of all, as a college student, we do not have any income. So a part-time job can bring us more freedom on shopping on our own. For example, a friend of mine is on a work-study programme, every month she gets one hundred and fifty Yuan. As a result, she can use her own money to buy her favourite things or things she needs. What is more, she feels happy when she uses the money which comes from her own labour. Second, a part-time job can bring us working experience, which we merely have but all companies attach importance to. It is also the most important reason. There are more and more college students every year hunting for jobs. Companies value working experience specially. So it is more and more essential to gain more experience. Last, we can grow up through a part-time job. If we meet difficulties, we must learn how to solve them. That is a process of growing, too. As the old saying goes "No pains, no gains". By taking part-time jobs, college students can learn a lot that cannot exist on textbooks or classroom. As college students take more part-time jobs, they have a better chance to know what the society is like, and adapt to the shift in society easily. According to all these reasons, we can draw a conclusion that part-time job is necessary for college students. It is obvious that college students can benefit great from part-time jobs.
