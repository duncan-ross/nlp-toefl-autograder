Our students are not of equal standers. Some of them are poor some middle classed and some of them are very rich. Poor students have the equal right to study even if they are poor money are wise but not poor study wise. Infect they are more rich in knowledge then many of the rich students. So, these students due to poverty found it difficult to continue studies. In order to cope with it they do part time jobs for their expenses. Their parents are not in a position that they would afford their heavy fees. So, they do part time jobs as burden on their life. They are in order to fulfill their demand worked for job and they this affect their studies in a way that they get weak and their health fallen. If Government provides better facilities to them that they could easily continue their studies and do their job as well with honor then it is good for them but if they are left alone to do job at their own expense then it would be an extra demand then part time jobs are good if they are done with proper time management if they interferes with studies then they should not be done. If they left no other choice for you that you have to run your family and do your studies as well then it would be only choice to do job. If depend on situation whether you should have to do job for your studies or just for enjoyment or time passing.
