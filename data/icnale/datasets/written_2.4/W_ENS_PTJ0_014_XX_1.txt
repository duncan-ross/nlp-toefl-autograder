I have to say that in my opinion it depends completely upon the student in question. Some students are very busy and have very hard majors such as engineering, psychology, biology, and more. Some students have major is that all acquire such intensive work such as business, political science, philosophy, and art. Therefore, a student should determine for his self or for herself if a part-time job is an appropriate investment of their time. For some students, a part-time job may put too much stress on their already busy schedules, but for other students, a part-time job may help them fight boredom and also make some money at the same time. For me, a part-time job is an important part of my weekly schedule because I do volunteer work. Although I did not make any money, my part-time job counts as credit towards my courses, so I can get a taste of the real business world and get some experience and be doing schoolwork all at the same time. I think I was very lucky to find this part-time job, and if all other college students can find such a position that fits their situations very well, I think they should have a part-time job too.
