Today in Indonesia, there is a lot of college students have a part-time job, with reasoning to help their parents in paying tuition fee, get any experiences, etc. But in my opinion they should be focus in their study. Because by having a part-time job, they will lose their focus to their program. Even though they have a good time management, but are still less focus than other students who don't have any part-time job. Example, I have a class mate who she having a part-time job. She is a smart girl, but because of she has a part-time job, she becomes an unfocused student, and finally she can't get her best score. If they said that they want to get any new experiences, isn't only by having part-time job. But we can also get new experiences by following a lot of scholarship tests and if we luck, we can win the tests and go abroad. So besides we get new experiences, we can make our parents proud also. That's why I disagree if college students should have a part-time job, because with focusing our study is also helping our parents. If we focus in our study, we can get our best score and if we get the best score we will graduate early and finally if graduate early we will reduce our parent expenses in paying our tuition fee.
