Nowadays many college students choose to take a part-time job for the purpose of obtaining more social skills. I really agree with them. Firstly and most importantly, the student will join the social competition sooner or later., but what they learned in school is just the professional knowledge, which is just made up small part of their social lives. It's the abundance of social activities that make interviewers deny their ability,. But if they have the experience of working outside, situation will totally change. They will know how to communicate with leaders, as well as with workmates and with customers. The perfect connection with people around will help a lot, no matter on the process of searching aid or struggling for more payment. And most college students will search a part-time job that is connected tightly with their specialized subjects. And no one would miss the chance to apply their knowledge into the processions. And the application means a good review. So instead of having a bad influence on their study, they can improve learning their level easily. There is one important reason for supporting the part-time job that can't be neglected. The lacking of time makes them become a well-organized man. Their schedule is full. So the person will never have a opportunity to drown themselves in computer games. For the three reason above, I strongly support the fact that university students take a part-time job. It's a chance rather than a waste of time. So I encourage all the college students to have a try on the part-time.
