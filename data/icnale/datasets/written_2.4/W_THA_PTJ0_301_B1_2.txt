In my opinion, part time job; the job that one can do after his class, work or when in the free time, has some advantages because off having more many things from working. The advantages that I mention are having more money, more experience and more communication. The advantages of the part time job, first, it's having more money. When one do his work, it' sure that he must be earned money and also part time. The second is having more experiences. When one works, he can learn many things form that working. The part time job can be added him more experience when he works. The last of the advantage is having more communication because when one works, he must communicate with others. It's mean he must talk, think or solve some problems with his colleagues, so he can learn these communications from the job that he works. Therefore, when one can learn many things from his working, he can be added the others by the part time job too. He can have more money because he works more and more, having more experiences because he can learn more many things from the job which he works and have more communication because off working by teamwork; work with his colleagues.
