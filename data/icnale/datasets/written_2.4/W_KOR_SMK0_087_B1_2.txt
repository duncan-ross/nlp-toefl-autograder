These days not only adults but also youths smoke. It is very serious problem. Smoking has some problems. First, it causes a disease such as cancer. Second, it makes non-smoker unpleasant because cigarette smoke has an unpleasant smell. Third, it is unhelpful in environment because cigarette butts are thrown away on the every road. So, I think smoking makes two victims. One is smokers and the other is non-smokers. Although the former enjoys smoking at that time, they will suffer from a disease related to smoking - many kinds of cancer-. And, the latter is under stress and also suffers from a disease because of smokers. It is wasteful to spend money buying cigarette. Therefore, quitting smoking is more helpful to smoker and non-smoker but, if smokers don't want to quit it, they ought to keep the manner. For example, they have to throw away cigarette butts in garbage and don't have to spit on the road. And, if smokers are with non-smokers, they have to smoke outside for non-smoker. Especially, Smoking is fatal to mother and baby. So, smoker has to be careful of the pregnant mother. If smoker pays attention more, non-smoker can be more comfortable and feel better.
