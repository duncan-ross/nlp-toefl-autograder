No one wants to sit near a smoker when having a meal at a restaurant. Something has to be done to ban smoking at all restaurants. The reasons are in three-fold. For one thing, smoking deteriorates public health. When smoking at a restaurant, the air is polluted at that restaurant. If people keep having meal with second hand smoke for a long period of time, their health would be worsened. For example, lung cancer is a common disease for both smokers and second hand smokers. For the sake of public health, smoking should be banned in restaurants. For another, smokers should not rob and steal the rights from non-smokers. People have their choice to smoke and not to smoke. If one smoke in a restaurant, he/she enforce others to have second hand smoke. There is no point in taking away non-smokers' rights and freedom. Smoking in a restaurant is not fair to them and it should be banned. More importantly, there is a safety problem. When people smoke in restaurant, it is easy to raise a fire. It is because in most restaurants, the table and chair are made of wood and menus are usually on the table. When one lights up something on the table, it is pretty easy to make a fire and bring a tragedy. It is not easy for people to get out from the emergency exit in a crowded restaurant. It is time for us to oppose smoking in all restaurants and it is time for our government to rule some laws to ban smoking in all restaurant in the sake of public benefits.
