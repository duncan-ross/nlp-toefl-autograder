Cooking a healthful food from fresh ingredients is not enough for customers anymore. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for two reasons. One reason is its danger to smoking customer's health. The other reason is its bad effect to other customer. A cigarette contains a lot of chemicals which are not healthful for a smoking customer. It is true that they cannot make any acute sickness. However, they can be kept in smoker's body. They gradually harm smoker's health. Finally, a smoker will suffer a lot of health problems, especially his respiratory problem. A cigarette gives a lot of white smoke which makes an uncomfortable environment for other customer. The smoke can blur customer's sight and hurt his eyes. Moreover, the smoke contains a lot of toxic gases. A customer who gets too much smoke may feel dizzy. And chemicals in the smoke can be kept in his body and harm his health. So, a customer can have health problems as same as a smoker. For a smoker and other customers' good health, I recommend all the restaurants to completely ban smoking. Just show 'no smoking' signs, they can save their customers from bad disease.
