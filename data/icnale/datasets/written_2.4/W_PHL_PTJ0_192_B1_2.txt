I do not agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is not important for college students to have part-time job because they should only be focused in their studies. They should devote their time and strength in their studies not in their work. College students who have part-time job will not have enough time for their studies and they may not have time to rest. They may not have time to study for their exams and to do their projects and assignments. Instead of studying their lessons, they are in their part-time jobs working. Having a part-time job can give college students money but it also has disadvantages for the students. It might affect their grades. They might also be already tired when they are going to their schools. College students will also lose their time for their selves. Being a college student is hard but it will become even harder if they have part-time jobs. In my opinion, it is the responsibility of the parents to give their children, who are studying, money for their needs. The responsibility of the college students is to study not to have part-time jobs.
