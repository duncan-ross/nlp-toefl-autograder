 As far as I'm concerned, part-time job is necessary for college students at present. Because taking a part-time job dose have many advantages. Here are some of them. First of all, college students themselves have the required skills. Compared to senior high school students, college students have much more leisure time and they are older so that they can take good care of themselves. They can do whatever they want to do without the permission of parents and teachers. So they have the time and ability to take a part-time job. Besides, as a college students, we should learn to be independent from our parents. We can make some money by taking a part-time job. At the same time, it can provide us with some experience which is necessary in our life. It can also be fun and interesting. Last but not least, when we take a part-time job, we will meet many people who take varieties of jobs. Dealing with these people can improve our communicate skills and lay a basic foundation for our future career. Of course, whether taking a part-time job is up to you. If you are busy with study, you don't need to take it. but if you have the time and urge and the will to challenge yourselves, you'd better have a try.
