I always wonder that as smoking becomes a kind of food for some people, as cigarette is allowed in the country, why don't we set a smoking restaurant for such kind of people, in this way, they can enjoy their great meal every day, we can not be poisoned then. But in the real world, this doesn't happen, so smoking can't be some kind of food, or it is something that really does harm to us all. But why it isn't banned nowadays, and even there are so many no smoking signs in public places, some times we can still find so many cigarettes scatted and smoke flying everywhere, I can still that there isn't a god of cigarette, right? So that's not some kind of relief, just some addicted people. Smoking does no good to smokers, as well as people around him. The profile that so many cigarette companies and government get makes them by no means let this big cake fly away. No matter how far the way we still have to go to forbid smoking, at least, smoking should be banned in the restaurant now. However, smoking in the restaurant is not only harmful to people eating there, but also a worst significant, for if in a country, smoking can enjoy the same position as eating, smoking tumor will exit forever. I can't image that what may happen to the family happily eating there in the future. Maybe some time afterwards, another family will be damaged by smoking again. So for a better future, smoking should be banned in the restaurant, NOW!
