In the past decade, many developed countries have recognized the harmful effects of smoking and made legal regulations about smoking. For instance, the U. S. forbids anyone to smoke indoors, while Japanese law bans smoking on the streets. Korea has made some changes as well, forbidding smoking in public places such as school and bus stop. However, there are no regulations for restaurants yet, which causes many discomforts for non-smokers. Korean culture has been especially generous for smokers. One can smoke in many restaurants, especially the ones with grilling facilities. Smoking is also allowed in many coffee shops with smoking zone, in most karaoke, and in almost every bar. However, now that the harms tobacco can cause are known in public, non-smokers need to hold up their basic human right to be healthy. It would be the best to ban smoking at all restaurants, but considering smokers' own rights and interests of the tobacco products corporation, this could take forever. Instead, non-smokers need to take a slower, but steadier route. The difficulty of separating smoking-zone from the regular dining place is not so much of a work. All a restaurant needs to do is to either make a enclosed smoking area in the shop or to limit the smoking zone only to the outside terrace. The government can take a part, too. The government can increase the tax rate for tobacco products, which will reduce the number of smokers eventually. The small steps will lead to a complete ban of smoking not only at restaurants, but also at any other indoor places.
