It is somewhat surprising to me that smoking has not already been banned at restaurants in Japan given how forward-thinking the image of that country is. Smoking cigarettes is a kind of old fashioned habit which lingers because the tobacco industry is quite large and makes a large amount of revenue. Furthermore, the government makes a large amount of money from putting taxes on cigarettes, and as a result, I do not see a good solution to this problem. Large corporations seem to be singularly skilled in keeping their profits high no matter what the costs upon the health or life styles of the people who use their products. Japanese corporations may be even more guilty of this than American corporations, and so it would seem that banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would be more difficult than it was for some states that the United States. Smoking also seems to bear more cultural importance in Japan than it does in the US, and so although I think personally that banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would be a good idea, I do not think that we will see a solution on this issue any time in the near future.
