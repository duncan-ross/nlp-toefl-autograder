I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time jobs college requires them to spend a lot of money on books, camps, and adventure stuffs hosted by the school. by having part time jobs, they can also increase their own allowance as they have the extra income by the part time job. students will then put less burden on their parents. results wise, i personally think that if the student puts effort in organizing his or her own time well, he or she would not have any problems dealing with the busy schedule of working and schooling at the same time. As college students have part time job, they will also realize that money is hard to earn and their parents are working very hard just to get them to go to school and pay the expensive school fees. The students will then realize that savings are very important in their lives and hence they will start to be more spendtrift. As they have a part time job they also learn to be more independent and they will learn new life skills that they can use in the future. With that, I conclude that it is very important for college students to have a part time job.
