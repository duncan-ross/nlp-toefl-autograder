I don't believe that legislation is the best way to ban smoking in restaurants. It really is a case of supply and demand, which private markets already represent. Having said that, private agreements will always impact on others in both a positive and negative fashion. In the case of cigarettes, they of course are having a negative impact as the market tastes have changed which means that they either have ill effects on others or have fallen out of favor for any number of reasons. For example, when people smoke in public places or restaurants, there is no doubt that they pollute the air and are a threat to the health of other customer's health. From that point onwards, the market changes and the law of supply and demand takes control of the situation. Less people will go to smoking restaurants causing the market to drop. Now that is an over-simplified marketing example but it describes the situation in a nutshell. If we dig a little deeper however, despite the fact that governments have introduced anti-smoking education, the number of adults and young people smoking, is surprisingly large. This means that the addiction for these smokers is not just drugs but in fact a deeper emotional attachment which means that it is harder to break and no ban in the world will prevent them from getting their fix.
