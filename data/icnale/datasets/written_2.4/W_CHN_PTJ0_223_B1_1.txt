As we all know, college is the bridge between schools and society. Therefore it's in great need that we college students take some part time jobs. In China, students are used to the school life. They are just connected to classmates and teachers and can get money easily from their parents. They will feel uncomfortable when they are suddenly faced with the society. They will feel tired when they have to earn their own life. However it will be rather different if college students do some part time jobs. Firstly, they will have four years to get used to the rules of modern society. That will make the adaptation smoother. Secondly, they will be able to communicate with business friends instead of classmates and teachers who are always supporting you, which make their future development easier. In a word, a man with four years' working experience is always more attractive than a freshman. This is the major meaning of taking part time jobs. In addition, taking part time jobs can earn some changes to improve your financial level. I can buy something I like without asking my parents for money. That will make me feel more independent. To be brief, it's of high value to do part time jobs.
