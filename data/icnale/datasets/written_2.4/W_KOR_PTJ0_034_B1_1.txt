I really agree about this topic. College Students pays for college tuition is very expensive. Expensive tuition is a burden on the parents. As adults, reducing the economic burden is not unusual. Through the part-time job, Students cannot learn in school can learn social experience. Part-time jobs experience that is indirectly. Part-time jobs make a person high. Students can cultivate a team spirit. And they can cultivate independence. College Students learns the importance of money and they will learn how to save. Some students go to abroad to study foreign language. And outside of school work to do additional experience will be enriched by the economic. For example, go to travel abroad, buy a book, buy shoes, Leisure activities, go to the movie, eat delicious food, buy a girlfriend's gift, buy a parent's present, pay bills etc. Also part-time job helps in the formation of connections and patience is raised. Part-time job will be motivated to study hard. Hard job makes a strong. Studying is important than part-time job. Studying is always more important than many money. This means, there are very effective if done properly. Therefore, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Thank you
