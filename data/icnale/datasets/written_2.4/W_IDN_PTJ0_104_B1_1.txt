When a person is graduated from senior high school, they will be a new college students. When a person want to be a college students, they must pay some cost. It's quite a big cost. Of course, their parents will pay for it. After a person is determined as a college students, as long as they study in that college, they must pay again for some administrations every semester. Now, in this essay, I argue that it is important for a college students to have a part time job for them. Below is the reason why I give this statement. First of all, it's important because now they are adult. When they are adult, they must get a job because, of course, they want some money for their daily activities. They can't ask for some money to their parents because their parents have paid the money for their college. So, where do they can earn sme money? The answer is from the part time job. Next, it's iportant to make them ready for the real job world. When they get a part time job, they can use it to train themselves to be ready for a real job world. Even it's a part time job, the life skill that they can earn is very useful to make them ready for a full time-job. So, those are my reasons why I argue that it's important for a college students to get a part time job. For every college students reading this essay, I say that get a job now!
