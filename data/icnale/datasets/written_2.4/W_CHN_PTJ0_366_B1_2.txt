 I agree with the idea that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Because as an adult, college students must have the ability of making a living by themselves, they should not depend on their parents any more. To take a part-time job can relief their parent's economic burden. On the other hand, it can also help them prepare to enter the society as well as make them more independent. For example, one person hasn't taken any part-time during his college life, and the other has experienced several jobs. When both of them hunt for the same job, the company must accept the more experienced one, for he need less time to adapt to the working tempo. From this example, we can also find that whether one have a part-time job also influence his future. To a certain degree, I also prefer to take a part-time in my spare time. We are not kids any more, if we get used to being carried by our parents, we can never grow up and can never become independent. Maybe someone will say that part-time is just a waste of time and energy and will have negative influence on their academic performance. But I can make a promise that doing part-time will just teach you more things that you can hardly learn in the class. After all, I completely agree with the idea that it's important for college students to have a part-time job, and I even think it's necessary.
