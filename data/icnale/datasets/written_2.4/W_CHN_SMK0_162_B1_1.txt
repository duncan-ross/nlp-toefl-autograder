It is almost known to all that smoking is bad for people's health. Scientific researches show that smoking can lead to heart disease, cancers and other healthy problems. We can find more and more people smoke in public places, such as bus stations, streets, and restaurants and so on. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the countries. I think smoking is forbidden in the public places is a measure to help people keep away from the harm of smoking. As we all know, it is difficult to stop smoking for smokers. One reason is that smoking usually becomes a habitual behavior. However, whether good or bad habits are not easy to be given up. Another reason is the effect of nicotine. It makes people addict to smoking. Besides, most smokers said that smoking can excite themselves when they feel tired or do not want to work. Now that giving up smoking is so difficult for smokers, we should give a hand to them. So it is a good way that people are not allowed smoking in the restaurants. On the one hand, this measure helps smokers to control their desire of smoking. On the other hand, it is also good for other people's health. In a word, we should take all kinds of measures to limit smoking. Health is the most important thing in our life.
