He took a deep puff of his cigarette and exhaled fumes noxious enough that passers-by have to literally hold their breaths and turn away to avoid breathing in the harmful smoke. Apart from the cigarette that hangs loosely in his fingers, he looks just like a guy next door, appropriately attired for school in his T-shirt, jeans and sneakers. He is polite, suave and even has the disposition of a perfect gentleman. However, a close look at his slightly stained teeth from high nicotine intake, his raspy voice and the coughing fits that never seems to subside, are enough to turn anyone off. Entering the school campus each day is practically like moving through a gas chamber, what with crowds gathered along the pathways, ceaselessly exhaling smoke. I have always wondered if these smokers actually have an inkling of the "contract" that they have signed with death when they light a cigarette and put it between their lips. After all, all cigarette boxes depict gory images of body organs that are mutilated through excessive smoking. The price paid for smoking is not simply measured in monetary terms but rather, it can also be seen as a gamble on health. Still, some smokers may have an addiction that they are unable to kick, despite making repeated attempts to do so. In order to help them kick their addiction, the Health Promotion Board has recently launched the "I Quit" initiative to encourage smokers to give up smoking. A helpline has also been set up for smokers who face any potential problems. For the sake of their health and their families, I do certainly hope that these smokers are successful in their route to self-recovery.
