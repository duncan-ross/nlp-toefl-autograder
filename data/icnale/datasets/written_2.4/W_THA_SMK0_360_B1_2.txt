I agree with smoking should be completely banner at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is the bad thing. But now a lot of people in the world are still do it. I think the reasons that cannot stop people to smoking are for example, in the family if the sons or daughters still saw his/her father smoking cigarette since they was young so they don't think that it was wrong, and now some of people who walk hard or maybe they would like to relax so they smoking immediately. Now smoking is just a fashion. Smoking no t only harm for smoker but also another people. Moreover smoking is cause the cancer which is the big problem now. So I think if the government has a project to banner at all the restaurants in the country it is extreamly good thing to do. Smokers don't have place to buy the cigarette so they cannot smoke. Another thing that government can do is to tell the people about disadvantages of cigarette. I think if everyone help together to banned smoking. This problem will disappear. Everythings cannot doing by oneself so if you don't know that your lover is died because smoking you must tell the person that you know to break with smoking.
