Recently, smoking has been banned in most public places. And the banning trend is stretching into the restaurants. For long, people are arguing about whether smoking should be completely banned at all the reataurants in the country. However, I'm in favor of saying yes, taking two influential factors into consideration. The first factor lies in the restaurants' atmosphere. Restaurnants are public places for people to enjoy their meals. And smoking is selfish when public places belong to all. Smoking at a restaurant not only sours one's own appetite, but has a bad impact on the eating environment, making others feel disgusting. Many people maintain that they won't step into a restaurant with a smoker inside. Thus, the behavior is expected to be banned for bringing harm to every one. For the sake of our safety, it's also definitely right to promote the banning. Can anyone imagine it that a cigarette end is carelessly dealt with in a place with oil everywhere? It can't be worse. Accidents can happen out of our expectation. Media always report restaurants' fire accidents resulting from lit cigarette ends. And we should make improvements and preventions upon the frustrating experience. In a word, smoking should be banned at the restaurants before more lives are claimed. Cigarettes are more horrible than we expect. It is time we took actions against the current situation. Only by completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country can we enjoy a sound eating environment.
