I don't agree the statement. That is, smoking should not be banned at the restaurant in Japan. Why I think so? There are two reasons. First, smoking is free will. The restaurant is not only for not smoking people. If smoking people banned to smoke in the restaurant, it is inequality. They have a smokers' right. Of course, they must worry not smoking people. A smokers' section is been for that reason. Second, annoying people is not only smoking people. The statement means indirectly smoking people is annoying. But, I think that the people making noise and the children running at the restaurant are much more annoying. They interrupt other customers' conversation. The smoke of a cigarette is certainly annoying, they can smoke in a smokers' section. There is no problem. Smoking people refrain from not smoking people, but that people doesn't refrain whoever. If smoking people banned to smoke in the restaurant, all of the people must have been banned to make noise, run at the restaurant. If the customer machining noise, run at the restaurant, who can drive out them? It is impossible. In the same way, it is impossible to drive out smoking people. I won't be able to smoke absolutely forever, but I think smoking is free will, so I think smoking not been banned at the restaurant in Japan.
