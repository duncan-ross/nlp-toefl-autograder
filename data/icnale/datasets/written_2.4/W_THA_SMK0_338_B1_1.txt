I agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons why smoking in the restaurants should be banned such as it annoy other people, it is impolite, it is dangerous for people who sit nearly the person who smoking and it is illegal too. It can annoy other people because of its fog and smell which makes other people is not satisfied, it can annoy people who are eating in the restaurant. Smoking is impolite too because the restaurants do not the place to smoking, if they want to smoke they should go to the smoking place or other place that does not have people. If someone still smokes the cigarette at the public area it can show their personalities which it is impolite. Smoking is dangerous for nearly seat people because in cigarette has Nicotine and Tar which make lung cancer decease for people who smell cigarette's fog. Therefore, smoking in the restaurants in the city should be banned because it is bad for people health who can smell its fog. Moreover, smoking is illegal, there is the law to control people to do following that people should not smoke in public area, if someone breaks the law they will spend fee commission.
