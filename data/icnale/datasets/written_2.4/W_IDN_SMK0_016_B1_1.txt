At my country, smoking has been banned at the shopping mall and I really appreciate it. I'm very agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. I think it's not only at restaurant, maybe also need to be banned at lobby hotel, hospital, church, college and many more public place else. My father is smokers, and I really hate it. For a thousand times I had been telling him to stop, but it's has nothing effect. But fortunately, my father does not smoke at home, or at car when driving. I don't know why people really like smoking and I don't care if they can't stop it, it's ok for me if they smoke at a place where no one there, because I hate to see people smoke at public place around crowd people. Because it is also dangerous for passive smokers, they can get an ill just because they live around smokers people. That's why smoking is really need be banned at all public place at every country in the world. Besides that, the smoke also caused global warming right? So, smoking is also give a happiness to the one who smoke but give a lot of negative effect to the nature and also to the people around them.
