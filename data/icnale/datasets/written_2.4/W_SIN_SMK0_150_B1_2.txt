 These days, we see more and more public places banning people from smoking, from trains to shopping centres. Some areas also impose a fine on smokers who break the rule. However, there are still places which do not ban smoking. Even if they ban it indoors, there is also an outdoor area for smokers to smoke. For example, there are smoking corners at several restaurants which allow diners who smoke to have their meals there. Personally, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, it provides a smoke free environment for customers at the restaurant. It has been reported that second hand smoke is worse than first hand smoke. Hence, it will benefit the non smokers and they can dine without worrying that they are putting their own health at risk. Hence, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Furthermore, by completing banning smoking at all the restaurants, it signals to smokers that smoking is not encouraged by society and this will motivate them to quit smoking. Hence, this will also encourage a health lifestyle for individuals. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
