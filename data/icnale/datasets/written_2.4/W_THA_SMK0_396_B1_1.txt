What do you think about smoking in the public places? I think it should not be allowed. Refer to many years researching, the result that; almost of the people think negative about it. Do you know? More than 80% of the restaurants in Thailand have been banned the smoking and if anyone smokes they will be fined for 2, 000 baht. But in the past time, smoking has been allowed for every restaurant, pub and club. That was very uncomfortable for the people who are a non-smoking person. They would inhale the smoke and get it more than the smokers. Right now there are the ways to solve this problem, the first one is fine and the second is set the smoking zone in the public places and restaurants so far from everyone. Smoke, there are many toxic and disadvantage, that is the good idea to protect ourselves from that. I'm very sure that you want to be happy when you have a dinner with a fresh air without smoke, smell bad and toxic. I don't blame that the smoker is the bad person but your smoking is affected to the other people and makes the people around the smokers get the carcinogen, Of course it should be completely banned!
