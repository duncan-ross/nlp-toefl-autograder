I believe that college students can be benefited by a good part-time job. At first, going to college is expensive, not every student can afford it. Not just the regular fee; books, transportation, entertaining cost or extra expenses like hanging out with friends, new clothes and shoes, etc. To many students, going to college also means leaving their family or home town. Suddenly, young students need to adjust to live outside with strange people. Learning how to take care of themselves is also important for students in their college lives. By having a part-time job, students can learn how to use their money more wisely. Nevertheless, college students are adults; they should not keep asking money from their parents. Work experience or internship is another reason I support college students to have a part-time job. Schools, in a way, are not as competitive as outside society. Part-time job is a good way for students to know what kind of quality, personality, and social skill they need when it comes to work. In the near future, they need to earn their living on their own. Work experience is important for them to find a job after they graduated. To sum up, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
