I think I don't agree with smoking in the restaurants. In another word, all restaurants should ban the smoking! Because it makes the body unhealthy, got many diseases in the body as you know like canner, heart disease etc. on the other hand, people who sit next to them or stay close to them also got effects from the smoking. The mother who has a little baby or who is pregnant can be harmful. They got nicotine from the cigarettes without smoking. The baby may get health destroyed as his mother does as well. If the restaurants want to let people to smoke, it must be various corners for smokers so that they can smoke themselves and don't distract others. Anyways, I don't support the idea to allow smoking in the restaurants because it is like you are inviting someone to die quickly and supported them to have a bad health. Nowadays, the government already announced the policy about banning smoking in the restaurants including night clubs and public places. However, the policy seems to be unsuccessful. There are still a lot of people who don't care about that and keep smoking like they are fine and who cares. I want to see people follow the policy so our country will be better.
