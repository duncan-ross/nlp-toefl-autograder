Smoking is should be banned all restaurants because of the harmful effect to our body that we breathe in. Also of its effect in the air that creates air pollution due to smoke that has no good affect at all. For those who are addict in smoking therefore should be in all restaurants they have a policy that there are place that smoking is restricted and place where they can smoke so that people who are eating do not destructed by the smoke. In all the country I think it is more important that banning the cigarettes makes more people to live long life than this 20th century who have the most number of smokers that kills more people and cannot expand their lives in the age of 50+. In case of restaurants banning is not so effective to stop the smokers because they'll find way to smoke after they eat because it is their habit but if cigarettes is absence in the restaurants, definitely few customer will arrive because most of the customer smoke and free smoke in restaurants if few and countable because it is also their assets to engaging in business and to find ways how to earn more money.
