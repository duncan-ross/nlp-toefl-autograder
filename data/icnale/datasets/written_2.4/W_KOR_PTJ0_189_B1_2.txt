Nowadays, we're College's tuition is very expensive I think. Not just my think, All of University student's think same thing. Part-Time-Job is very important thing of our Life. Because we should pay college tuition. But we don't have enough money, so we earn tuition. As a result, university presidents of Korea are like Money. They don't think student's grim realities of life. Now In Seoul, Some University Students demonstrated against the government Or President of University. I marched as in a demonstration of support. Lee. The Korea presidents said presidential election pledge. One of them for this pledge is a half price of University/College Tuition with no strings attached. But Lee. Don't keep his promise. It is natural for They to get angry. I'm upset too. All University students have a same mind and heart. National universities led the increase by raising tuition 41. 8 percent over the past five years, the NSO (National Statistical Office) noted. I don't look so bright of Korea's University. At this rate, All of Poor University's students are hounded by themselves creditors. It's an illogical conclusion. So we prepared our future's Home, Car, Family and Descendant. In conclusion, I agree about the Part-Time-Job for Our livelihood. At the present rate of progress, Korea's national power will be decline. All I care about is feeling complete is Our National Power. Thank you.
