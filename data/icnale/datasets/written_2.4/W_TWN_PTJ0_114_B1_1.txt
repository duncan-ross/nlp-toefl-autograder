I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. When they have the part-time job they may have more responsibility to theirselves. And before they entering to the college, they didn't have more time to go out for the work. So I think they don't know how to go with other people. Besides having the part-time job they could learn the social relationship that people never learned in the book. For example, I have learned a lot when I am a tutor. I learned how to teach my learn to students and how to communicate with their parents. But the most instant is that I can make money by myself. And when people have a lot of part -time job they will learn how to use their time. I think this is a very important skill for anyone. And only they can distribute their time usefully they can have more efficiency to do their things. But I think when college students have the part-time job, they couldn't forget their homework. How to use college time is a very importment that it may influence everyone after they graduate. Such as their first job, because their boss will consider whether or not to admit this social fresh man.
