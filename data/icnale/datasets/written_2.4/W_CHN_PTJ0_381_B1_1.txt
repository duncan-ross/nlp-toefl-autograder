 I agree the opinion that college students should have a part-time job. I have three main reasons to support my ideas. Firstly, we have much spare time in our college life, and how to make use of this part of time make a great difference. If we only do the scientific or literal work in our spare time, we will become indifferent to the work and lack of practical experience which will make us stay at a low situation in the social competition. In addition, lack of work experience will always keep us from the society like a mist. It's competent to do a job in the enterprise if we had similar experience. Secondly, during the period of part-time job, we can get acknowledge of the companion in the company. And these people can do a great help to our way to be qualified, and the relationship will be a key to our application for the job. Last but not the least, experience of part-time jobs can also make us have some pocket money. Though the amount is not important to us, the feeling of managing the money we earned by ourselves is helpful to our experience of management. Above all, It's of great importance and essential for us to have a part-time job in college life.
