I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I believe that it would be quite beneficial for college students to work part-time, but it is not that important. There are many reasons why having a part-time job would be great. However, studies still come first. Tuition fees having been increasing over the years for college students. This financial burden can be lifted slightly with an income provided by a part-time job. Students will then not have to grapple with paying back their student loans, or even risk getting into huge debts with the interests before they can even find a job after they graduate. In Singapore, with a booming tuition industry, most students should be able to find tuition jobs that can allow them to earn some spare cash as they study and lighten their financial burden. Also, in an ever more competitive world today, a part-time job would allow those college students to differentiate themselves from those who do not have. Their resumes would be of more substance. They are able to write down more work experience or skills learnt or even opportunities that students without part-time jobs are unable to obtain. These would allow that to stand out and separate themselves from the other graduates. Even with all these reasons, the main job of a college student is to study first. Without a good degree, everything else is useless. Hence, I would say that to find the right balance, to be able to manage your studies, that would be the important thing for a college student.
