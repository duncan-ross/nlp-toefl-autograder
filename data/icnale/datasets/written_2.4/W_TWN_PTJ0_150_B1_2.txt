As an old saying: "Rome was not built in a day. " If the person who want to be at the top of the others, he must be worked harder and also practice more than anyone else. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is a chance for the college students to learn the things those we won't face in the student life. When being a student, the most important thing is try the best to learn, learn as much as you can, when facing obstacles we can ask parents, professors or friends for help or cooperation. But when being an employee, we have to cultivate the ability of completing the things independently. If without any practice, we often feel panic when the day before we are going to work or even starting to work. So, having a part-time job is the way to practice before working. Part-time job is just like a miniature of real working. We have to deal with several problems that we might faces when we are in the real working condition like the interpersonal relationship with colleagues, the relationship between me and the boss, and the attitude when facing the difficulties. Repetition is the mother of knowledge. Only practice again and again that will one can achieve success. Learn more from every part-time experience, because all the experiences will become the foundation stone in the future working life.
