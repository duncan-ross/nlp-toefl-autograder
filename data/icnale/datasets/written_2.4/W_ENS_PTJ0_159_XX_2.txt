I believe that having a part-time job is important in the UK right now and I would dare to say, equally important in other regions of the globe. The world as we know it is undergoing great trials and tribulations financially at this time, with no quick end in sight. I would strongly urge all students to have some type of part-time work even if it's just doing a few gardening jobs, three or four times per week, to earn a few pounds. Printing money is not a viable solution because the market can only take so much before it becomes valueless. This is a time for creativity and providing service or fair exchange for money. If all of the students attending universities and colleges were to work a few hours every week, this would do wonders, not only for their local economy but also for their self esteem. Additionally, for those who's parents are funding their education, it would provide some financial relief for them and also forge stronger family bonds and earned respect for taking a proactive role in their lives rather than taking the low road, like some do, by just continuing to ask for and expecting, never ending handouts without a thought for what some parents might need to sacrifice in order to fund them.
