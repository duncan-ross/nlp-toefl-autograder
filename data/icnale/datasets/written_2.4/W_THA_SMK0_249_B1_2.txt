Have you ever been worried about your health when you have to stay near someone who is smoking? This question is for the people who love their health. Many of them have bad experiences about the smokers when they visit the public places such as the park, the amusement park and the department stores. The restaurant is the place that seems to face this problem even though there is a space for smoking. This cannot help decrease the problem because the smoker who doesn't have a good manner still smokes in the food area. When I go to the restaurant, I sometimes find that it is boring to sit near the table which people are smoking. The bad smell destroys my appetite for the food. I also concern about the health problem. I have known that people who do not smoke will receive the bad smoke which can cause the cancer. In my opinion, in Thailand all the restaurants should ban smoking. There should be the penalty for the smoker who smokes in the public area especially in the restaurant. This will help decrease the health problem of the other people who do not smoke.
