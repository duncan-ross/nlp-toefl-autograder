I believe so. It gives students some sort of education about the real power of money rather than just earning and saving. It did for me and I learned very quickly about how to make my small part-time wage work for me and not just by putting it into a savings account to grow at a snails pace with some form of low, annual interest. No way in the world! I am not saying that saving isn't important just that it is only a small part of our financial portfolios. Students would learn about budgeting and paying their bills etc. and hopefully, with the right guidance, learn some basic investment strategies. I suppose that for a lot of students, they need the job to pay fees or living costs etc. but if they could look at the possibilities beyond those points and as I mentioned previously, receive some form of guidance or better yet, a sound financial strategy, then they would have made a good head start towards securing their financial future. They won't get this from just every part-time job that they do or boss that they work for though. So, I think that it would be good for universities/colleges to provide the guidance that I mentioned and the students would also benefit from the knowledge that while the job itself might be a lot less than they desire, it still presents a financial opportunity that can be turned to their advantage on a larger scale than they first thought.
