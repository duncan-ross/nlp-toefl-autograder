I couldn't agree less because it is none of the government's business. If restaurants are running their businesses correctly as stipulated by law then that's as far as the government's involvement needs to go. It's a matter for restaurants and their client base or the market if you like to call it that to decide. We don't need to call the government every time that we want to change the curtains or a CD and the restaurants and the people should be allowed to make their own decisions and run their own lives without too much government interference. The restaurants will either allow smoking or they won't and from that point onwards, it's up to the consumers to decide what they want to do. Some restaurants have already banned smoking in Japan anyway and that's OK if they're happy and their customers are happy then it is necessary for the government to stick their nose in. On the flip side though, if restaurants allow smoking and consumers are happy again it's been resolved without the government. Business owners and consumers are not all idiots or children and should be free to make their own legal choices about what suits them without having the government babysit every five minutes.
