I don't think smoking ban in all restaurants in the country would be a great idea. If they ban smokers from smoking in restaurants, where do you think they will go? Would it be wise if they will smoke in their houses on which their family will become the direct secondhand smokers? Was it better if they will smoke on sidewalks? If the government will ban smoking in all restaurants, smokers will be found anywhere, and it may worsen the case of secondhand smokers. Smokers find cigarettes more stimulating and delicious after eating. They say the pleasure from smoking is really different after you eat, and if that's the case we cannot stop real smokers from doing their habits. They will smoke cigarettes whatever happened. Instead of letting them smoke away from the restaurants, I think it is better to give them smoking areas where everyone enjoys smoke and where they cannot influence or affect non-smokers at the same time. To be brief, in my opinion, banning people from smoking in all the places except to those designated smoking areas would be more appropriate than smoking ban in all restaurants. Having smoking areas would greatly reduce the percentage of secondhand smokers and hopefully the smokers themselves since there will be a hassle in going to a distant area just to smoke one stick of cigarette.
