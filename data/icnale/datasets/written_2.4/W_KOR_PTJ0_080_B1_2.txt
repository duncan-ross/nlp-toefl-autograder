I disagree with the topic A. In my opinion, there are several losses of part-time jobs. These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. First of all, education is difficult and complex. Doing a part-time job can deprive of their study hours. They have less time for study in comparison with other ones who don't do a part-time job. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. A part-time job might interfere with concentration of study. They may feel tired easily and therefore, they can't concentrate on study. Also, they may feel asleep easily in class. After all, it causes lowering of efficiency when they study. Third, they might lose interest in their life. Other students who don't have a part-time job have time for decreasing stress of study. But they have no time for enjoying their life.
