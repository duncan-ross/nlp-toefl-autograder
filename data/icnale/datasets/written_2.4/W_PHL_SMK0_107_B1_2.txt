We should banned people from smoking inside the restaurant. We should have manners and etiquettes. We should respect others who do not smoke for their healthy life. If one customer smokes inside the restaurant, others customers should suffer from the smell and ashes which are bad for the body. There are also several reasons why we should banned people from smoking. It is because that as generally known, the 2nd hand smoking is worse for the body than 1st hand smoking. For 2nd hand smoking there is no filter which blocks ashes and other bad ingredients to go inside the body. And there are what you call manners in public places which we should follow. We should not make others uncomfortable by the smell of the cigarette. We know that there are also young people who came to the restaurant to eat and enjoy with their parents or friends. They also can smoke outside the restaurant if they really want to smoke, even if it is tiresome for them to do. We should think of others before thinking of our own benefits. By helping others to keep their rights and by following the manners inside the public we can make better and happier society.
