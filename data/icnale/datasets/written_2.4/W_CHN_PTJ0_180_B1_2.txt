Nowadays, it is a common phenomenon that many university students tend to take part-time jobs. And many people don't agree with this phenomenon. However, as for me, it is important to take part-time jobs for us college students. Following are some advantages. Firstly, taking part-time jobs can benefit us a lot, not only our tuition fees, but also a lot of experience that we can not learn from school books. We can earn some pocket money by taking part-time jobs. And when we are taking part-time jobs, we can know that the competition between the workers is fierce. Besides that, we can also realize that it's difficult for our parents to earn money for our study. Secondly, we can combine our academic knowledge and reality together. We will understand the knowledge in school books more clearly. An old saying goes, Practice makes perfect. Therefore, if we enjoy our part-time jobs, we will succeed in the future. What's more, taking part-time jobs is an important way to make full use of our spare time. And it is not an obstacle to our study. However, it is also a test for us to deal with the relationship between practice and study. In conclusion, I support the heated phenomenon that it is good to take part-time jobs. And I'll take it into practice in my college years.
