I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is a harmful habit that does no good to either the smoker or the people around. As is known, smoking makes it easier for people to get many kinds of diseases especially the cancer. As health is so important to human beings, we should abandon the bad habit using any available way. Secondly, smoking would make the eating environment much less enjoyable. Supposing you are having a delicious salad on a fresh spring morning, and the scent of the flowers is wafted along by the breeze. You start to breath greedily, but that's the moment when someone begins to smoke. You'll be choked and then physically and mentally nauseous. Since many people in the restaurant are sharing the same bad feeling with you, it's necessary that smoking become totally banned at all the restaurants as soon as possible. Thirdly, the restaurant is a specific kind of public area, where people meet and influence each other. In that sense, smoking may affect many curious teenagers or kids who cannot distinguish right from wrong. If they go astray because of having watched too many brilliant adults smoking in the restaurant, our society would have to take the inescapable responsibility of misleading them to do so. In a word, cigarettes should not be accepted by all restaurants for nobody could afford the grave consequences it leads to.
