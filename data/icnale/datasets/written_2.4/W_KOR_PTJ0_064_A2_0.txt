In my opinion, having a part time job will be good experience for the university students after their graduation. For example, if a student who hopes to work in a hotel in the future, it will be very helpful to have a part time job in a hotel. He or she can learn what happens there and how to deal with the unexpected problems. When they write the experience in a hotel into the resume and cover letter it will be a strong point which attracts employer to be. Secondly, the students who have a part time job can help their parents economically. I think they have to earn our spending money by ourselves. Because their parents are spending their much money for the tuition they need to earn some money to buy their textbooks at least. And I believe they have enough ability to work and study well at the same time. However I insist part time job should not effect on their studying badly. So I would like to recommend it to the students who have a responsibility to work and study both hard. For the students who cannot do that, I want to suggest that they had better concentrate on just studying.
