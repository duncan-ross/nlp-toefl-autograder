A student is like an insurance of any thing for country, is should be maintained with attention, firstly it takes from our side but it returns by doubling it up when there are no other sources remained. If we do not care about our precious things, we do not provide them appropriate service these are spoiled & depreciated before the time. Same like with students because they are the Future falcons of a country. We can say that a student's life is the busiest age of his whole life because he learns new things everyday, every hour and every minute. While in practical life he implements these learning to get benefit and to be succeeded in every field of life. Proper environment, able teachers and opportunities to progress are the basic needs of a student. These needs are attained by only few lucky students because these are being costly like every other thing in this country. Government institutes are unable to provide these things because of bribery, corruption, carelessness and such other evils. Blockage of opportunities and limited resources are causing inflation. Income of a common man is same but expenditures are doubling up. The rates of books, notebooks and most importantly fees are going out of hands of even a middle class person. Except these unachievable expenses many of youngsters are so that they are in the age of study but they have to feed their family also, they have to fulfill their educational dues as well as household expenses. That's a tough task and not everyone is capable of such strong responsibility. Although student has a busy life and faces many tough tasks to be successive in his educational field in such a competitive age However, he has to perform a part time job as well because the present situations require it; otherwise he may have to leave his studies when there would be no resources left.
