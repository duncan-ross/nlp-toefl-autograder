Since I have spent a lot of time working in pubs, which also serve food, I would have to agree. Before they introduced a lot of the bans throughout the UK, working in the pubs if you were a non-smoker, was pretty disgusting and you would go home smelling like a fireplace every night. A lot of the old guys or older smokers found it hard at first, but then they saw everybody else going outside so they eventually just went outside too doing a lot of complaining mind you, but they got used to it pretty quick. We know a lot about the toxins that are smokes these days and I think everybody around the world pretty well understands that fags will kill you in the end or those you love. A lot of the pubs are pretty small in the UK so that made the stink of the smoke even worse. Since coming to Japan, I see nearly the same thing as far as space goes, small spaces many smokers. The thing is though, is that it might be one thing to smoke in a bar or pug, but I think that it's a bit much when everybody is smoking throughout the local family restaurant because there is also a lot of young kids there who don't have much say in what happens to them. So I absolutely agree with a restaurant ban although I am still a bit new to the Japan scene, I think that it is in everybody's best interests, at least for their health.
