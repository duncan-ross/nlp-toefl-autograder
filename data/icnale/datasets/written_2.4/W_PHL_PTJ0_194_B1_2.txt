As we all know jobs are important in order for us to have money. It also enables us to apply all the things that we have learned and helps us enhance our skills. There are times that people make use of their talents and skills to earn money and that are what we called a part time job. The first thing that comes into my mind when we say part time job are teenagers. The reason is most of the time college students are the ones who ask and need this kind of job. Having part time jobs has a big importance especially to those college students who are independent, that their parents cannot support their studies anymore. Especially if we are the students who are really determined and have many goals in life we will not be contented that our parents cannot provide us proper education anymore, we must find a way just to achieve our dreams. Like, some are working in restaurants as a server and others become assistant and many more. Having these kinds of jobs can help in our studies and at the same time it also helps our parents in a way that they will have lesser expenses to be paid. Nowadays, college students are trying to get more part time jobs as much as they can because it provides us money and at the same time it also enhances our skills and talents. As poverty continues to become rampant, it is so difficult to provide money especially when it comes to the education of students. So, having and finding part time jobs are not that easy. We must have the skill; trust in ourselves and patience in finding these kinds of jobs.
