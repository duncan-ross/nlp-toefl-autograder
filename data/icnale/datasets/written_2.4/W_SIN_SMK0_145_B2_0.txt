I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is the activity of smoking cigarettes of tobacco and is associated with health risks such as lung cancer. Majority of the population does not smoke and most people dislike the odour and smoke from cigarettes. However, to ban it completely at all restaurants is too extreme an action. The concern over smoking in restaurants is due to non-smoking patrons' irritation and discomfort over the smoke while they dine. Dining is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable affair and their experience would be marred by the activities of smoking patrons. However, to place such a blanket ban on all restaurants would be very unfair to smokers. It is also impractical as smokers would simply move outside the restaurant or somewhere nearby to carry out smoking. This defeats the purpose of non-smoking patrons wanting to avoid the smoke created by smoking. I believe that the onus should be on restaurants, and they should formulate their own policy on smoking. Restaurants could partition their dining area into smoking and non-smoking areas, or not differentiate the area at all, depending on its clientele. For example, a family restaurant would be more likely to ban all smoking activities in its restaurant in consideration of the presence of young children. Conversely, a restaurant that caters mostly to wealthy clients and working class patrons would be more sensitive and tolerant of the activities of their patrons in order to ensure their continued patronage. Ultimately, the action to ban smoking at all restaurants would only be effective if coupled with more stringent smoking policies such as the ban of smoking in all public areas. Otherwise, I believe that such an action should be considered and decided by the involved restaurants.
