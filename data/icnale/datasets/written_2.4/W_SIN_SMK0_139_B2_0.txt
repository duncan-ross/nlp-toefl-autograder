Agree or disagree? As a non-smoker, I feel strongly against this statement and strongly agree that it should be implemented in the country. To create a clean and green environment is both in line with the government's vision and the goal of restaurants attracting more customers. Appealing to the general public that dislike the smell of cigarettes is definitely an encouraging approach for the customers. However, this action may evoke an argument to on how the rights of the smokers are being taken away. It is important then to weigh out the rights of other non-smokers and their health concerns if smoking was to be allowed in the restaurants. In addition, smokers could always proceed outside of the restaurant to enjoy their puff of smoke. Also, smokers that are finding ways to ditch this addiction may actually appreciate this action. The restriction of smoking areas in the country will act as a form of good pressure in helping to deter and aid them in their fight against the addiction complemented by the various ways and methods developed to help against the addiction. Of course, there will be a minority of smokers that will not fall into the either groups mentioned that support this action. However, regulations should be made to accommodate to the majority and not the minority. If smoking is allowed in restaurants, the resulting situation is a polluted environment that will not attract customers, contradicting the business benefits of the restaurant.
