College students have much available time and we have lots of free time arranged by ourselves. Which provide us more opportunities take part in university activities or some social practical activities apart from our lessons? I would like to make use of some time to do some part-time jobs to increase my social experience and improve myself which probably have influence in my future career? In our country there are more and more college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's becoming quite common to see students busy running errands after lessons. Some say colleges students are expected to do concentrate on studying, because study is just like their jobs. However, I think it's a good thing for college students to take a part-time job while studying. On the one hand, college life which consists of only study is not balanced and may cause the student to miss out on other valuable learning experiences. In addition to bringing more balance to a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. On the other hand, it can make the students realized that it is hard to make money, And then they can change their bad habits. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families. For all of these reasons above, we should take some part-time jobs so that we can integrate theory with practice. I firmly believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college if they can balance the job and study.
