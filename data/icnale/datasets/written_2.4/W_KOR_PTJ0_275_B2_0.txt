I extremely agree that students should have a part-time job. I think part-time job is super necessary for college students. In Korea, the money which is paid to register for college is too expensive. Our parents have some burden because of that, and they have to do some work for their children to enter the college not for them. It means our parents sacrifice something for us. It is acceptable when we are middle or high school students. But now, we can have a part-time job, that is, we are able to earn some money. We can't afford to pay total register fee, however, we can help our parent to give some money. Or we should pay cost of meals, buy some clothing, etc. In Korea, students have some tendency to be helped by their parents. However, we are all adult who can decide their own lives. Therefore, we should have some part-time jobs and make our own life by ourselves. It doesn't mean that we just earn some money. We should not only do things like that but also study our major thoroughly. If we make an effort to use times efficiently, we could be killing two birds (both money and grade) with one stone.
