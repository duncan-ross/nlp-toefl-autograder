I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons for that are as follows. First of all, the most important thing for college students is studying rather than working. We paid fees which is not so low to come to college on purpose of learning knowledge and building ourselves instead of making money. college is a best(maybe the last) place for people to study. We can read books, communicate with teachers and students freely and do a lot of research we want to. That is the original and real purpose that I choose to go to college. On the other hand, I believe we can learn more about work after we graduate from college and have a full-time job. what benefits can part-jobs bring to us?Most part-time jobs are easy work that even a junior can do. So I think it is a waste of time to do part-jobs that can offer you nothing but few salary. On the contrary, I think we should seize days to learn more. As the saying goes, Time is Money. I think it is more reasonable to use the time we now have to exchange for the money of future. From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that part-time job is not important for college students at all.
