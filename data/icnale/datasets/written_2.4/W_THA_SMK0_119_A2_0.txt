I think that smoking is dangerous. It can kill both direct and indirect way. The direct means when you smoking, some smoke and chemical access to your body after that all bad diseases will show the results. You may be sick at the beginning but after that you will find out all cancer cells works and they going to kill each part of your body rapidly. The indirect is the man who is not smoking but accidently sitting beside the smokers also receive chemical from cigarettes. This poor man is very unlucky. He never knows that something bad already go through his body. When he met smokers over and over again, finally, he will have the same bad effects from cigarettes as well as the smokers. Another point, it is my personal view which isn't based on any other ideas or research. I think smoking can cause global warming as well. Why I think like that because there is smoke! When many people keep smoking and the number is increasing day by day, in all country around the world. Our world is covered with all smoked from the cigarettes. Finally people may die from the smoke of cigarettes. So if you are attracted to smoking in restaurants is not even good because it makes other people injured from cigarette smoke. It is not a good idea, so it must be banned!
