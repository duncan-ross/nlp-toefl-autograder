It may become a waiter, shop keeper, a course teacher, even businessman. It is very useful for them, because it have many advantages, firstly the students can fulfill their spare times with the useful activities. They may be bored, because they always study in all the day. Beside that, it can practice them becoming a strength people, because they can get the soft skill going out of their study in college. The second advantage is they can get some money and help their parents to increase their pocket money by getting some salaries by their own job. The third, the students as a social human, must be able to interact with the other people and it will increase their experiences which is not regained in the college.
