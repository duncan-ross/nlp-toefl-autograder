Everyone knows that smoking is a bad habit, it can cause many bad things. In some country smoking in public area is banned to reduce the effect. In Indonesia there is some reason that make hard to banned. In Indonesia smoking is more than just a habit, but it is something that everyone must do it. There is a lot of children that smoking, they do not know that is a bad habit that can cause cancer, etc. Some people know about it but they still smoking. The government try to reduce it with make a rule that not allowed to smoking in public area in the exchange the government make some place to smoke, but there is still so many people smoke in public area. In other side most of Indonesia people is working for cigarette company, if smoker is reduce the company must reduce the employee. That make more job for the government to do. In the fact cigarette can cause many bad thing. Cigarette can make other people around the smoker get the same bad thing. So government must make the rule more restrict that make smoker stop they bad habit, and the exchange for the employee of cigarette company is a new job.
