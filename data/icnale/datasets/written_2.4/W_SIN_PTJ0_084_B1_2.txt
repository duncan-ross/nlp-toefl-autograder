In the context of Singapore, it is a good experience for college students to have a part time job, but it is not important - unless, the student happens to be from a lower income family with difficulties paying for school fees. Engaging in a part time job will give one more exposure of the industry. Students interested to pursue a career in a particular industry can hold a part time job in that particular industry to gain more experience and apply what he/she is learning in school to work. It can help the student figure out whether he/she really wants to pursue a career in that industry after graduation. However, in the context of Singapore, most universities degree makes internships compulsory. Students will be exposed to the industry during the academic life sooner or later. To have a part time job in the specific industry is therefore, not important. Yet, one's family and financial background needs to be considered. Not everyone can afford school fees and sometimes government subsidies are still not enough. For students from lower income family who might require to take a bank loan to pay for school fees, securing a part time job would be important, to help the family cope with living expenses.
