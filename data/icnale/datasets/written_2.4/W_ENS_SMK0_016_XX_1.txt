I have never been to Japan and I didn't know that smoking was allowed in the restaurants there. In the restaurants here in Colorado, smoking has been banned for almost 10 years, and like many others I think that this has been a good move for our state. I don't know if other states in the US still allow smoking in restaurants, but if so, I think it should be banned there too. My opinion probably will have any effect on the Japanese situation, but I do think that banning all smoking in all the restaurants would be a good move for that country as well from my own experience. The restaurants have become cleaner, and it is easier to enjoy a meal there than it was 10 years ago. Most of my friends are smokers do not seem to mind that they have to step outside if they want to have a smoke. Like many others, I absolutely abhor the smell of cigarette smoke, and I feel that it will disburse better outside than it would inside. I don't really care if people smoke and it is their choice, but I don't think I should have to smoke too if they want to.
