Smoking should defiantly be banned in public places. The places they do allow smoking might lose a bit of money, but it will also help with the health problems that occur. Most people believe that someone who is not in the smoking area of the public place will not be affected by the smoke, but smoke is able to spread in a room and affect the people around. Smoking causes many problems. First of all it pollutes the environment, secondly it harms not only the smokers but also the rest of the people who breathe the polluted air and thirdly if smoking is forbidden it will help smokers to quit smoking. The first advantage of prohibiting smoking in all public places is that the environment from finished cigarettes and empty packets will be eliminated. In all public places such as streets squares and many times inside buildings cigarettes butts can be found everywhere. I believe that this image is very disgusting and that my fellow citizens have a very bad habit to throw their cigarettes and the packets on the floor wherever they are except their house. This is a very serious problem which can be solved if the governments ban the smoking in all public places cigarettes are pollutant and put in danger the health of non smokers in public places. Unfortunately smokers like to include their habit in public like at home. I believe that if smoking banned in all public places speciallyin resraurants the amount of smokers that will quit smoking is going to increase. Smokers the most of the day are in public places such as work, shops, cafeteria's or college campuses so if they cannot smoke it will be easier for them to quit smoking.
