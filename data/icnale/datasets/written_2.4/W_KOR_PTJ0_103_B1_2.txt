I didn't part time job, but I have worked in library from March in this year. I think it has advantages and disadvantages. There are three reasons. First, it has achievement when I received part time job's money. Part time job is very difficult and tired. But when I solved every work in part time job, I felt happy and achievement. Second, it can learn patience. When I was tired, I can't rest because of students who find a book and works. But I thought it should do. I can learn considerate mind and affirmative inclination. Third, it makes friends with the other school subject. I got along with my school subject's friends, but I make friends with the other school subject after I worked part time job in library. I am really happy and pleasure. However it has disadvantages. There are two reasons. First, it is really tired. I am so really tired because many works and students who find a book. Many works are cleaning the library and carrying books, arranging the books, and so on. I am exhausted by students who find a book because sometime they found a book that find difficult and they disarranged books. Second, it is difficult to have my leisure hours. After I came to work at home, I am really exhausted. I can't everything. Therefore, part time job feel achievement, but it is very tired.
