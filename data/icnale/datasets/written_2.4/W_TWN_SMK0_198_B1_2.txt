Few months earlier, a piece of new laws was put into practice. To give everyone perfect places to eat, drink and hang out, the government kicks smokers out of public places. We all have been in this kind of situation. When we are just enjoying the chat and the meal with someone, smoke appears. It spread so fast and widely that you can do nothing but hold your breath and watch your food being polluted. It ruined one of your perfect times. However, when you turn back to figure out, the only scene is that a smoker is relieving himself. Why all the people in the restaurant should suffer this? Not to mention how harmful that smoke can be. Therefore, I totally disagree that restaurants allow anyone to smoke. It should be banned. A restaurant is the place that we enjoy good dishes and perfect atmosphere. No one would like to be disrupted by toxic gases. In addition, more and more restaurants have had smoking areas. If you are the smoker, then please, stay in the smoking area. If you are not, then have fun having your meal without smoke. In this way, both smokers and none-smokers can have meals delightfully. For everyone's health, I think that no smoking in restaurants sounds like a good idea.
