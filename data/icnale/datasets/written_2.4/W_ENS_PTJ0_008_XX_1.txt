Almost all of my friends in college have part time jobs and so I think it is very important to have one too. By having a part-time job, I have the freedom of disposable income, and that allows me to go shopping or go out to eat with my friends whenever I want to. Although my parents pay for college, I do not think they should have to pay for all my day to day expenses and so I'm trying to do them a favor by supporting myself a little bit. Also, I really don't like the rich kids whose parents do everything for them and I think it is important for us to learn how to live and be responsible adults so that we can go out into the world one day and know how to take care of ourselves. There are plenty of ways to find a part-time job that doesn't get too much in the way of studying or hanging out with friends and you can also make many new friends if you have a part-time job. Finally, in some cases a part-time job can get you experience that you can use after you graduate. For these reasons I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
