Millions of people in this world are the great smokers. It is true that everyone have rights to do anything what they want to do, but in the condition that "the things" mustn't disturb other's rights. That's why people should not smoke in the public area where there has a lot of people. Restaurant for example, there is no way for the smoke to pass through from inside out. And of cause, smoking creates a lot of pollution. The smoke as a pollutant is extremely hazardous to human body. It makes we breath harder also effected to our eyes too. People who breath the in smoking area oftenly have a higher risk to get the lung cancer, because the chemical compounds in cigarette are poisonous. Do we want our children live in the higher risk to the bad illness? The risk that they may loose their parents before the right time? Now it's the appropriate time to start the new era. Smoking should be completely banned in all over public area such as restaurant, garden , school or even in the office. It's time for revolution!
