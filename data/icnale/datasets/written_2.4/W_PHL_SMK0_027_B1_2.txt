Smoking is bad; it is unhealthy and reaps no benefits whatsoever. Looking around you, smoking occurs everywhere: inside compounds, outside by the street, beside a church, under a tree, and the list goes on. There have already been several campaigns to stop smoking altogether, however, most resulted in utter failure. We need to start somewhere, and that is why I agree that smoking should be banned inside restaurants. Restaurants are outlets which serve food for the hungry, and majority of their consumers are families. These families are hungry for real food, not lung cancer. Inside a confined space like a restaurant (where ventilation only exists in the kitchen), second-hand smoking will occur, and affect several innocent customers. It is not only the customer's side that gets affected, even waiters and chefs are part of the cause. Majority of employees who undergo stress relieve themselves by smoking in their breaks. Smoking not only destroys the lungs, it also damages vocal chords, and dulls the tongue. I, personally, would not like a dull-tongued chef to be serving me food which he cannot taste. I, personally, would not like a waitress to receive my order but reek of tobacco. There needs to be more professionalism and a change in attitude for all kinds of people. We must all respect each other's space. You cannot go barging in someone's conversation as much as you cannot go polluting your acidic smoke in public environments. There needs to be a stop to this and this is where it begins. Smoking should be banned in restaurants indefinitely.
