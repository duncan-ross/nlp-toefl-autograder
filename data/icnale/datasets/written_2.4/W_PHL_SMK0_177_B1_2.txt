The short term effects of smoking are higher blood pressure, rapid beating of the heart and dizziness. On long term you can suffer for instance chronic bronchitis, which has a major impact on daily life. By smoking the chance of getting certain diseases is increasingly, compared to people who do not smoke. Smokers are twice as likely to have a heart attack and have a bigger chance of a cerebral hemorrhage or a stroke. Another consequence of smoking is lung diseases, like lung cancer. Of all people with long cancer, ninety percent have smoked. So is bad for our health. Especially in eating places like Restaurant. To my mind every smoker should think about surrounding him people, first of all smoking hurts to them. I think that manager when he makes project of his future restaurant should think not only about visitor's satisfactions from food or cozy conditions, their relaxation and impression from his place, the most important thing is that he should take care of their health, he should not allow them to smoke in a hall, where there a lot of non-smokers. Even if there is a special separate hall for them, manager should take a responsibility and think just for a minute that money is not the first aim of his restaurant, it is that he wants to make people's life more interesting more various and carries joyful and piece to their life. Today we can see that where it is a smoking in restaurants there are alcohol drinks in it. That is why we come up to the decision that every manager cares only about benefits for himself. Smoking is very bad for your health, and it has a major impact on your body. 1 in 2 smokers will die sooner by smoking, so we should stop smoking.
