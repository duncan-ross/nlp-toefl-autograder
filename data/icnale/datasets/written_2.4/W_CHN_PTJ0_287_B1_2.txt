Nowadays there has been an increasing tendency for college school students to take a part time job, causing a hit discussion between our class. We are divided on this issue. Some of us are firmly concerned that taking a part job has no good for us students, claiming that it is too early for us to step into the society. They believe study is second to none in importance for college students, and part time job is a waste of time because it takes a lot of our limited time and energy. Others, however, have a brief that it is both necessary and helpful for us to take a part time job, considering we can learn a lot of lessons that we cannot learn in books when we work. Besides part time job can earn us some money to ease the pressure on our parents. For me part, I agree with the latter point. In my point of view, we can come to understand the hardness of making money, making us to treasure the money we get form our parents. Taking a part time job does not necessarily have conflicts with study in time, concerning we have andante leisure time. What is more, it can also make our college life more colorful.
