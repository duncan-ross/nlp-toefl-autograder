When we go to the hospitals, we can see a lot of ads that talk about smoking. Because it is very harmful to our health, it can cause the lung cancer. In our lives, we always see many people smoking in the restaurants even if the restaurants announced that smoking is banned. The air in the restaurants mixed with dangerous material is scared. It not only makes the smell strange but also destroys our body. However, now secondhand smoke is also known by the people. Even you are not a smoker, you are exposed under the dangerous air also lead to the cancer. The risk made by secondhand smoke we face is more than smokers made. If the customers want to smoke, they can build a smoking room for them or tell them to smoke outside. Every place has different manners of restaurants. In my opinion, the most important thing is that every customer's health. So, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Otherwise, I think that government should increase the fine of smoking if smokers smoke in the restaurants. Because they not only harm themselves but also harm other people's health, to do so, we can see a better effect on the policy, we can create a healthy environment we live.
