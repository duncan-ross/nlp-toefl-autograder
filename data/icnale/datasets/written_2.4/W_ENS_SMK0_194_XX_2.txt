I agree. Not only is passive smoking annoying it is dangerous to the non-smoker as well. It is enough that smokers blow smoke all over Tokyo except in a few prohibited places without having to sit in restaurants that smell like chimneys and throughout the meal, be concerned if it was safe to eat while smokers were puffing away on their fags. The thing is that passive smokers die from the same diseases that smokers do and it is time to put a stop to it. I do concede that everyone can choose to go to smoking and non-smoking restaurants (if there any around) or not to go anywhere. On that basis we all make our decisions. However the poisons from smoking can float through the air and not only be inhaled by non-smokers but they can also be on the skin and more important the food. Now over a period of time this might be OK and then suddenly, someone gets sick and eventually dies. But it is not necessary to take the risk and we now know that chemicals from fags and food do not mix well together, so it is best to keep the fags away from the food altogether.
