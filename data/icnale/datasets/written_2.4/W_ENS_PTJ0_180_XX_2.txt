I agree and I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job while attending college. It is important because the current global economic climate makes it so. Jobs are harder and harder to get and many graduates are struggling to get any kind of job. Having some work experience or on the job training may not guarantee to get them a job, but it will certainly help them if there is a fit between their skill sets and an advertised job. While they are working, they should attempt to get any other skills that can be gleaned from the job as well, just n case. These skills will never go to waste and will more than likely be put to use several times in the student's career. It would be nice to think that the recession will be resolved by the time students graduated and that may or not be the case. It is best to focus on what we can control rather then what we can't. In this way we are focused on honing our own skills rather than worrying about events that we have no control over. Either way it is always good to be prepared for any thing that may eventuate.
