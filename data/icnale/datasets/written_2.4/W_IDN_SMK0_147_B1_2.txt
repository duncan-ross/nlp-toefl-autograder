I think smoking shouldn't be banned at all restaurants in the country because it can disturb another customer who having a lunch or a dinner in that restaurant but is very hard way if you want to banned smoking. It is very impossible if you banned the people who smoke because now days the cigarette company is the biggest company in Indonesia and in the some of the country. They have very big a career opportunities so if you banned smoking it's means that your country have a big unemployed degree because like I said before that the cigarette company is one of big company in my country. So If you are a good people I think you should go to the outside of the restaurant and find a place where you can smoke without another people feel disturbed because we all know that the people who inhale a residual smoke from the smoker who called passive smoke is more dangerous than the own smoker. I think In every country if the people have a self-aware it's means that smoking shouldn't be banned in all of country. The way to get a self-aware from the people who smoke is tell to the smoker how dangerous if they are smoking between crowd people.
