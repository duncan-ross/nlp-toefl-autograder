I think it's not important for college students to have a part-time job. College students can experience new works by a part-time job but I don't think it is important. Before going to the college, students usually don't have a part-time job so college students can experience new things by having a part-time job. However the main role of students is studying so a part-time job is less important and the main purpose of a part-time job is not new experiences but earning money. Therefore, students find a part-time job based on the money and it has little meaning to experience. For example, the most favored part-time job by college students is tutoring and it is not really helpful to college students except students who are learning the subjects related to the subject of tutoring. However, many college students have tutoring as their part-time job. It is just for money not for other things. If a part-time job is used for experiencing something special, it can be important and helpful, but in fact many students don't think about it. Then, I think a part-time job can interfere students' own college learning. I think studying is more important than a part-time job except the case which a part-time job is helpful to students' own studying.
