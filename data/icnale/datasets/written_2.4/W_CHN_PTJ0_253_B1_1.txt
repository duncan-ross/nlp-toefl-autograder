Nowadays, part time job play a big role in college students life. I firmly think that it is essential to do part time job for us college students. To begin with, it can enlarge our horizon that we do a part time. When we communicate with social people in the work, not only can we learn a lot of technique skills, but we can also get to know more information from the society, which we can not learn in our school. On the other hand, we almost learn all of our knowledge in the class but have not put it into exercise. It is part time job that can teach us to us use the knowledge more effectively in our life. Last but not least, doing a job can make us aware of how to earn money and how hard it is to earn even one cent. Doing a job will cultivate our economical life style, which will leave a deep impression to us who have been taken care of since we were babies. To sum up, even if part time job may be hard to us, it is a perfect way to make us mature and close to the society.
