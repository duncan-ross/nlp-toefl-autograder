I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think restaurant should be clean and comfortable. But someone who smoke in restaurant, there become duty and uncomfortable and stink. I can't understand why a person smokes. I hear that people who passive smoking is unhealthier than smoker. Smoker get around people annoy. If a person enters the restaurant and who begin to smoke, around people become uncomfortable. And a person go out restaurant, smoke stay there a lot of times. People who eat in restaurant, who become passive smoking. If a person who smoke in front of restaurant, I don't want to enter there. I once think that the restaurant which is for smoker exclusive use. But clerk become passive smoking. So I think smoking should be completely banned. Amount of cigarettes price is too expensive. If you become no smoking, you should not waste for cigarettes. You become healthy and save money. There are all good for you. I think smoking become completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. So smoker will be more and more decrease. And I hope that no one smoke in the future. I hear that cigarettes butt is a lot. So, if no one smoke, Japan's garbage become more and more less.
