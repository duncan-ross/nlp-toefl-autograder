I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is very bad for your body. I don't like smoking because it makes me cough and it makes my throw hurt very badly. I don't like it when my friends smoke around me because the same thing happens. I don't understand how they can breathe that stuff into their lungs, because it is full of bad stuff and makes your mouth very dry. It also makes your teeth yellow and makes your clothes stink. Even some of my girlfriends who are smokers who think they don't smell bad still have the cigarette smoke smell around them. This makes it hard to be in the car with them or otherwise be around them. I bet that a lot of young Japanese girls feel the same way as I do. I bet that they think it would be a good idea to ban smoking especially in restaurants. Otherwise, they probably would not have asked me this question. Smoking is also bad for your clothes. It makes them smell bad, and if you get ash on them it is very difficult to get it off. Also, all the boys I talked to say that they do not like to kiss girls who smoke, so I think that is a good reason to have abstained from smoking too.
