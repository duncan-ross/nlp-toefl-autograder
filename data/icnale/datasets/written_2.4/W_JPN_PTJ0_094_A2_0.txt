I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, I thing we had better experience a lot of things during our student life. Part-time job is one of it. Please imagine you are a home teacher. You have to step into other people's shoes. Your student may require you to explain matter easy-to-understand. And you will try. Through the trial and error you will think a matter from different perspective. So, it may help you think something deeply. And you cannot get this experience during you are the student. Next, please imagine you are a café shop clerk. You have to smile every costumer even as you feel low. You can know how to make an artificial smile. It will help you to protect pointless conflict. So, various experiences will let us spend more wonderful life. Secondly, I think we need know the worth of money and time. Part-time job will teach us that one hour's worth. To get money is difficult. If we just spend money that our parents give us, we may lose control and cannot use it well. Finally, money can help us make life for ourselves. We need pay a lot of money during our student life. If we just depend on our parents, everything should through their permission. Depend on these reason I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
