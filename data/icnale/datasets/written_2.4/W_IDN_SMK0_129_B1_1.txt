Well, smoking is the popular thing in the world. The majority of people especially the man is smoker. But now not only men but also the woman also is smoker. They enjoy with that because smoking can decrease stress and sleepy. The smoker can smoke everywhere they are, because it is their right as human being who lives in the world usually the smokers smoke after eating and somebody usually eat in the restaurant. So I don't agree if the government ban smoking in restaurant, because usually someone smokes after eating. They can be more enjoy after eating. The government should think how to solve the problem and the idea will not suffer both restaurant and the smoker. So I think the owner of the restaurant should have two areas for the customer who is smoker and not. So the customer can enjoy the food and the restaurant can have many customer. Talking about the disease as the effect of smoking, I think it is just trick for the people who hate smoke and want to damage the smoke industry because the diseases come from many other reasons and causes. Although the person does not smoke but they can get disease so the smoker can smoke everywhere no exception in the restaurant.
