Yes, I agree. Part-time jobs give college students exposure to the working world, and the experience they get from it is something they cannot get in school. For one, they learn that it is indeed very tough to earn money. This may cause them to be more cautious of their spending and thus be able to better manage their finances. For two, they learn how to deal and manage situations. Of course, this varies on the job they take up. For example, if they enter the service industry as a part-time service crew-member, they would learn how to handle customers and how to handle public relations. Also, they would learn practical skills such as serving food and drink. However, if they take up an administrative job, they would be more proficient in using the computer, for example, with Microsoft Word. Some may not be in favour of the idea, for it entails forgoing their free time with friends. However, I am in total support of the idea, because I believe it prepares one for the working world and also, is a break in the monotony of school. Of course, I would recommend taking a fun-filled job, because it is something that most would not do as a long-term career, and this gives a wide variety of exposure, to the individual.
