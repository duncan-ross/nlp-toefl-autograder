One reason is because smoking damages our health. Smoking increase the risk of lung cancer and is risk factor for others disease such as high blood pressure, angina and atherosclerosis. The damage can be even higher when the other person inhales the smoke that burn form the cigarette. This can happen in a restaurant if smoking is not banned because diner are often sitted close together. Another reason is because smoking can irritate the other person appetiate. Imagine that if a person next to your table is smoking while you are having your dinner in the restaurant, you would definitely feel uncomfortable as you be worried whether the dust from the smoke would goes to your food. However, some may think smoking should not be banned. One opposing reason is because they felt that people should have the freedom to choose what they want to do even in the restaurant. It is a person habit to smoke before and after eating the dinner. The restaurant should not restrict it. However, this reason is not valid as although the person should have freedom to choose what they want to do but they should not forgotten that they are cause others people discomfort though their action. This is what we should not do in a civilised country.
