 In my opinion, part-time work has become more and more necessary for college students in recent years. And it has been a trend to take on a part-time job for college students. As we all know, everyone wants his college life to be full of colors and part-time work is one of those important colors. College life should not only be about study and activities but also conclude chances to walk into our society. Of course, there is no doubt that part-time work is a precious opportunity to walk out the campus to learn more about our society for college students. Only by part-time work can they get more precious experience which will be useful for them to find jobs after graduating. Besides, for some students coming form poor families the earned money can help them complete their college study. Moreover they can prove themselves by doing part-time work very well and become much more confident so that there will be more passion for them to study, work and live. As a result, college life will also become more colorful. To sum up, it is necessary for college students to spend some spare time doing some part-time work instead of some meaningless things like computer games.
