I definitely agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have been studying Japanese for a number of years, and last summer I was lucky enough to be able to live in Tokyo for several months. I love everything about that city, but the one thing that really bothered me was how smoky the restaurants and bars were. I also love to play pool, and the pool halls are ridiculously smoky. It makes it very hard to concentrate and have fun when your eyes are burning and you are coughing. All this is to say nothing of the horrible effects on people's health of that come from smoking. Smoking causes tar to build up in your lungs and affects the ability of your blood to absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. Furthermore, it has been conclusively shown that smoking causes cancer. In the past, the harmful effects of smoking were not well known or not well publicized, but now I feel that almost everyone is quite aware of the horrible things that smoking can do to your body. I don't understand why anyone would want to harm themselves on purpose, and I think that banning smoking in public places like restaurants is a great step in discouraging people from hurting themselves.
