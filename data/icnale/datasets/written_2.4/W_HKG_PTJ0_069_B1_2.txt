Is a part time job important for college students? As a university student, the way of studying should not be restricted in the campus anymore. Taking a part time job is undoubtedly important for us because of the following reasons. First of all, taking a part time job can allow us to learn something that can never be learned from the textbook. For example, we can learn how to work in a group and how to get along with different people in the working environment. If we are doing a salesman, we can even improve the communication skills as well. Secondly, doing a job can let us know that life is no long that easy when compared with our campus life. This is because if we are paid, we have a big responsibility to finish all the tasks assigned to us. And we can never shift the responsibility to the others people. Last but not least, we can make more money if we are taking a part time job. This can allow the poor students to lower the financial burden caused by the expense tuition cost.
