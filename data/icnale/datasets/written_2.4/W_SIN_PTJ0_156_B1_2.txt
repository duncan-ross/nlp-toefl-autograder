 I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It provides them with opportunities to venture into society and acquire life skills which can only be picked up from experience. For example, we see college students working as frontline part-time salespersons attending to customers when they need help. Through this, they learn to communicate with their customers. When they meet with different situations, such as difficult customers, they learn to deal with it effectively too. These skills will be crucial when they enter the workforce in the future. Not only that, some college students find that their parents are not giving them enough allowance and so, I feel that the best way for them to finance themselves will be to have a part-time job. Rather than asking their parents for more cash, it will be more appropriate for them to take up a part-time job to earn money. This way, they will become independent persons and learn to treasure what they have. In essence, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, I feel that it is also necessary for them to be able to multitask and be responsible for their own studies too.
