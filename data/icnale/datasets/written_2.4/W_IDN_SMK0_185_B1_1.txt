I always meet somone who smokes cigarettes every where, so disturb. Actually I do not like someone who smoking in social area. Didn't they know that this act will disturb people around of him or maybe they know but they unrespect with human right. People around the smokers called passive smokers, as a people they also have their rights. Let me remind you again that smoke can cause a bad effect in out body. The younger the onset of smoking the longer one will most likely smoke and the younger one is more likely to die. Smoking is a slow killer, not just to the smoker but to those also around him as they are effected by second hand smoke. The life expectancy of the smoker is cut short by 10-12 years and more than half of all smoker die from smoking related disease. If you an active smokers and want to quit, now is the right time to stop. Planning to stop smoking or even just for cigarette habit has affected everyone at one time or other, directly or indirectly. if you do it now, you can make a big difference to your health and these smoking fact can be turned around. it is never too late to stop smoking and greatly benefit your health and today is a good day to stop.
