I agree. Students get more experience, or perhaps their first job experience which will look very nice on their job applications. They certainly increase their workloads which may be good for some and bad for others which really depend on how the students handle pressure. A few weeks of working and fulfilling their study requirements will soon tell if they can deal with it or not. The money will always come in handy and some desperately need it. Possibly they will gain some transferable skills such as money management, time management, communications skills and it really depends on the kind of work they will be doing and whether they are able to integrate those skills into other areas of their lives. Overall, they will either make it or break it as far as dealing with pressure and stress goes. If anything goes wrong, I think that it is better to happen earlier in the college days than later because it will allow them time to rectify the situation. In some ways I feel that it would be good to screw up in minor ways so that they learn to be resilient and learn from their errors and move on to the next challenge.
