I strongly agree with this. In my attitude I think smoking is very dangerous because it can damage smokers' selves and people around them. Toxin substances in the cigarette can cause a lot of bad effects to their health such as lung cancer, cancer in mouth, heart disease and gastritis. Furthermore, it will make smokers haven't good personality and outlook. Smoking in the restaurants should be not allowed because the people who are in that area will become second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are victims that are damaged by smoke from the cigarettes although they don't smoke. It's unfair. The people will risk if they have a meal in the restaurant that has smoking. In addition to the people will be moody and unhappy when they smell smoke. The smokers ought to smoke only in the areas that are allowed. The restaurants are the public places so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The most people who don't smoke should not get bad effects with the smokers. There must be strict rules for compel the smokers. If they don't follow, they must be punished. The effects from the cigarette are important events thus we shouldn't neglect.
