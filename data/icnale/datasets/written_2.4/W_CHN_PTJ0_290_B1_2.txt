Nowadays, more and more college students are doing part time jobs during their leisure time. In my opinion, I think that it is good for them to do so. Doing part time jobs can let a college student understand the society better. They will know the unwritten rules of communicating with social people. Also, doing part time jobs is a way to spend their times. It is much better than just sit in front of the computer playing games all day. From my view, many college student don't know how to take of themselves and work with responsibility. Doing part time jobs is also a good way to train them and teach them how to work as an adult. What's more, doing part time jobs also can let college students earn more money for themselves. Almost all college students are adults now, but most of them still take money from their parents. Their expensive tuition fees and living expenses give a lot of pressure to their parents. If they take part time jobs, they can get some money for themselves and reduce the pressure which their parents take. Also, they can understand the feeling of earning money by themselves. They will be more mature than ever. To sum up, doing part time jobs is suitable for college students. It can let them experience more and provides students with more chances of social practice, which benefits them both psychologically and economically so long as they keep a balance between study and jobs.
