I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I want that public places as well as restaurants should be completely banned. There is the reason that I agree this sentence. First, Not All people smoke cigarette in the restaurants. There are people who hate cigarette smoke. I don't like cigarette smoke and many people don't like it. Cigarette smoke makes people unhappy. Second, the people who smoke cigarette throw their cigarette any place after smoking. So many places are messy and dirty. Many people are living in the world. And many people walk the roads. So I want to see the clean road. Third, if a person smoke cigarette, he (or she) have a chance of cancer highly. And we showed and heard in TV or newspaper and so on that many people are dying every year. Every person in the world knows this fact. Nevertheless, they smoked cigarette ago, are smoking cigarette now, will smoke cigarette in the future. I don't understand why many people smoke cigarette. If a person who smokes cigarette wants long life, stop smoking cigarette. If you stop smoking, your friend and family are happy. And many people make clean roads.
