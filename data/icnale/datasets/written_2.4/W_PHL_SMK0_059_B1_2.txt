I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Basically, the purpose of restaurants is for eating not for smoking. There are just stupid and selfish people who go there and smoke. They don't care about other people who would be affected by their action. Aside from this, there are many bad things if you smoke in a restaurant. First is that food that the people would be eating might get contaminated by the smoke coming from the cigarette. The customers might get sick if they eat contaminated foods. Secondly, the cigarette really emits bad smell. It would not be pleasing to eat if the environment smells bad. There might also be fire if the lighted cigarette was not disposed properly. And lastly, the second hand smoke is really bad for the health. If the other people inhaled it, they might get sick. In a restaurant, I believe that every customer possess equal rights. And those rights are the right to enjoy the environment and the right to have a healthy food. Before doing anything, a person should always think of the effects of their actions to the other customers and not just only think of their own pleasure.
