Prima facie, it may seem that it is important for college students to have a part-time job but speaking from the standpoint of a college student, I personally find that the opportunity cost of having a part-time job is too high. As a college student, we must first realise that our education is our top priority. While having a part-time job may have its monetary perks, the benefits are gained at the expense of studying. The time spent working could have been allocated to the time spent understanding and internalising important concepts in our respective modules. Even if the schedule of a college student may be relatively flexible and is actually able to accommodate the commitments of having a part-time job, we must be aware that it may impose on the student unnecessary stress that could possibly hinder one's studying process. Of course, this is not to completely ignore the benefits of having a part-time job. A part-time job will help prep the college student for his or her future career, through work experience that will equip the student with imperative work skills such as interpersonal skills and the ability to multi-task under stressful environment. Thus, under the assumption that the college student are not experiencing any financial difficulties, I postulate the importance of a college student having a part-time job in the holidays in order to negotiate between gaining benefits from both spheres of work.
