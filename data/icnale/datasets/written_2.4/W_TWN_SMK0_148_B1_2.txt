Have you ever got annoyed by those who smoke when you go into a restaurant? In my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, from most of the medical information which has been indicated in public, we all know that smoking is really bad for health because the cigarette contains many toxic materials which will result in chronic diseases even cancer to people no matter they smoke or not. Secondly, the environment is one of the most important factors which can attract customers to the restaurants. Shouldn't restaurants provide a clean dining environment for their customers? Therefore, it will definitely influence the rights and moods of those who do not smoke to have meals in clean environments if there are people smoking at restaurants. Last but not least, no one can promise the smoke from smoking area will not float to other places in the restaurants even though the restaurants have set up the non-smoking area. Who are going to be responsible to those customers who are under the risk of getting lung cancer? With all the reasons, I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
