A part time job is not a job. Usually young people do the job. In Korea made a rule which is the basic salary for the people. It's 4320won. In addition the employer also gives the basic salary. The employees make smaller money than that work time and the work is very hard. However there are so many jobs and there are many employees. Young people or a person doesn't have professional qualification or idea cannot regular job. Because regular jobs need a professional idea for their company. Why student need a part time job? They need money to buy something. The university tuition is very expensive. They don't want their parents have to take heavy responsibility so they want to make their pocket money. In the other hand Another student needs their tuition. They have made their own fees. When I was a high school student I just wear a uniform or school t-shirt and eat food which given by school. However university student is different. We need more everything. We need clothes which are not uniform and we have to eat different place which we have pay. In conclusion a part time job is personal choice. The people who need money can get a job.
