Part-time work is a good way for students to get smarter. Everyone thinks that the only way you can get smarter this is by studying in school, but it is very easy to learn some new things by having a part-time job. I don't have any specific examples in mind. However, I do know that some of my friends have part-time jobs and they always have some reason to smile when they come back from work. I think this means that they are having a good time and that they are happy. So it is probably a good thing that they have part-time jobs. By having part-time jobs, they are allowed to find out some new things that might help them in school or outside of school. It is not good to just be book smart, it is good to be street smart too. That is what matters in the real world. Even a genius like Albert Einstein had some problems during simple things like tying his own shoes. I am not a genius, but I can tie my own shoes, and I think that I would like to find a part-time job to give me more street smarts so I can take advantage of that.
