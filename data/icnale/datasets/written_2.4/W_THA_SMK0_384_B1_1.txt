Nowadays, Smoking is the problem that every countries could not stop it. Thailand also could not stop it. On the other hand, it is serious problem now. I agree with the topic that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reason that why smoking should be banned. The first reason is unhealthy. Surely, smoking is the bad thing for heath. You could see from there are many problems from smoking like sickliness. This is the main problem of Thai people who smoke. Because Thailand is the number one about people died from smoking. The second reason is money. Nowadays, the price of cigarette is expensive more than in the past. Therefore it not good for the person who have low income. And Thailand is the country, where is developing country. So we should stop it right now. The third reason is happy. If the person who often have smoking, they will not happy. Because the person who live near him will complain him. For the smoker who stay with many people like family. You should stop smoking, if you love them. Because if you still smoking, you and them will near death as soon as. Therefore, the smoking should be completely banned in Thailand.
