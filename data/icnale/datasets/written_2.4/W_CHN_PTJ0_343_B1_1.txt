Though having a part-time job can offer college students an attractive income and an opportunity to experience daily work, it is still not important for college students to have one. In my opinion, a college student's most important task is to study hard and have a better understanding of his major. But when he has a part-time job, he has to put some of his energy, sometimes most, into it. We can imagine that if someone threw himself into a part-time job, what will happen to his study. In the meantime, part-time job itself has some problems. Sometimes if we get a part-time job in an informal way, it will have some unknown risks: sometimes we cannot get paid, sometimes the job's hidden danger isn't told and we have to take risks to do it. As I know, to get some work experience is the most important reason why we have a part-time job, but what can we truly get from it? Most part-time jobs are boring and we cannot get anything from it. So why don't we just do some volunteer work instead of having a part-time job to get work experience? It is much better. And we can have a freer schedule to deal with our study.
