As we know smoking is an unhealthy habit. It is not only bad for the smokers but for the people around. While smokers are enjoying smoking people around may feel uncomfortable or disgusted, especially when they are all in a restaurant to have a sweet meat. Air with tobacco will ruin the appetite. So smoking in restaurants absolutely should be banned. Now in some restaurants, they still have some places for smokers to "relax. " Though both smokers and the managers of restaurants think setting a little place is a good way to solve the problems of smoking. But people still can smell tobacco even it is just a little. Smokers can't clean the air which is filled with nicotine right after they stop smoking. So the best way to solve the problem of nicotine is prohibited people smoking in restaurants and public places. Smoking in restaurants will also cause smokers to have bad breath. So they can't know how delicious the plats are. What they are eating is just nicotine, nicotine, and nicotine. In order not to ruin the atmosphere of testing food, I can't agree more that smoking in restaurants should be banned.
