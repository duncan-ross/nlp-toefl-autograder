When entering the college, the students' daily life has changed a lot, most of their time can be arranged by themselves. A large number of students choose to take a part-time job to fulfill their campus life. In fact, large part of their parents don't support them doing part-time jobs. In contrast, I maintain that it's important to have a part-time job. Firstly, the college students are innocent as they have never been touched with society. Through doing a part-time job, they can learn some practical skills what can't be learned from the class. On the other hand, an increasing number of companies need the employees equipped with working experience when they graduate from university to search for a job. What' more, they can make money by hard working to decrease their parents' burden. Also, it can teach them that it's not simple for their parents to earn money and develop a good habit of saving money. In reality, it's better for you to arrange when to buy and when to study, or it will have negative effects on your study. Above all, having a part-time job is to learn further working shills. Do not waste time on playing computer games or having a date. It is benefit to have a part-time job.
