More and more students have part-time jobs when they study in college. I have a mixed feeling about it. In my opinion, it depends on different situations. On one hand, some students are not good at their studying and they should pay more effort in their homework and previewing. For these students, it's not wise to have a part-time job. On other hand, most students have no barrier in their studying. It's not enough for these students to study theory in college. They should practice more and use their learned knowledge in practicing. The best way to practice is finding a part-time job and there have two benefits. One is students can get experience from job which is beneficial for them to find job. The other one is they can earn extra money from job and it can strengthen their ability in independence. In addition, most students who has part time job have the problem that how much time they should spend in their job. It's important for students to deal well with this problem; otherwise it will make a bad influence in their studying. All in all, students should choose carefully whether or not to find a part-time job.
