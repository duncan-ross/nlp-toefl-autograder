Smoking is very traditional in my family. Ever since I was a little girl, my parents of have been smoking, and their parents and their parents before them were all smokers. Sometimes it makes me sad that I come from a family of such heavy smokers because all four of my grandparents died from lung cancer, and they died a relatively young age mostly in their early seventies. Even though they were kind of young when they died, the last years of their life was very bad and they did not have a very high quality of life. So in some ways, they really only lived like 50 or 60 years, and that is simply to shorten the time seeing as it is the age of modern science and medicine. I don't think that tobacco companies are doing a good enough job of explaining the harmful side effects of their products, and I don't think that governments are doing enough to restrict usage of tobacco in public places. Although I don't really know anything about Japan, I hope that they will ban smoking in restaurants so that no young people have to watch their relatives pass away in pain and agony.
