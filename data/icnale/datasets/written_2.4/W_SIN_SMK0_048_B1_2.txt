I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because not only is smoking harmful to smokers themselves, it is also equally detrimental to second hand smokers in the restaurant. As most restaurants are indoor and air-conditioned, the smoke will be contained in an enclosed area. The smell of smoke would be overpowering in the restaurants and that would definitely put off the non- smokers who are dining there. Also, banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good way to show that the country emphasizes the importance of public health. This ban protects non-smokers from taking in second-hand smoke at public areas such as restaurants and minimizes the exposure. Smoking is known to bring about detrimental effects such as respiratory problems, increased chances of getting lung cancer and many other health issues. Banning smoking at restaurants reflects that the government wants to raise the awareness of smoking and discourage smokers. Additionally, smoking ban will help to increase the indoor air quality in the country and proper ventilation can be maintained. Even though the ban might result in loss of business in the restaurants, I believe that such a large-scale and nation-wide movement will allow the pros to outweigh the cons in the long run.
