I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, college students can obtain the social rule through a part-time job. It's required in any situations to get jobs and get along, and it cannot be mastered in a short term. A part-time job is the best place where they can master it. Secondly, college students should independent of their parents. Few of them are under their parents' control completely. Then they should try not to receive their protection. So they must earn the whole money which they their selves spend if possible. Finally, college students should get income by their selves to understand the worth of money. Some of them already drive a high-class car or rent an expensive apartment, but most of them don't earn the money needed to do them. If they lead a life with no trouble in money without earning, will they try to work for a normal salary? Won't they choose to depend on their parents rather than to work which they aren't used to? In spite of the decrease of the number of newborn babies, if the number of young people with such ideas increases, Japan will face a serious shortage of labor force. To avoid the situation, to earn through a part-time job in college time is quite effective, I think.
