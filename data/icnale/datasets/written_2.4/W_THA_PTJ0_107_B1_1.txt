I have two answer is agree and disagree. The first, I agree with topic because in today's tough job market, you need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that you have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that you have had some real-world, adult experiences and that you can handle yourself outside of the classroom and off campus. And the second, I disagree with topic because college learning has a lot of substance that student will study and remember it so college's life just be diligent and always review the lesson. It make student hasn't time to do part-time job if do part-time maybe make learning of student is down that it effect to future's student about grade that company will consider it if it not good the company maybe not receive. So college student will do something just always manage the time to good first.
