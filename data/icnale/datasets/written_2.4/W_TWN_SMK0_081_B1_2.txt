I don't agree with forbidding smoking. Though I am not a smoker or a shopaholic, I think we should think about those who like to smoke. As we know that cigarettes are harmful to our health, the surfaces of all the cigarettes mark the damage of smoking. Those who still want to buy have revealed us their decision so that we should take respect to them. We cam see many place have smoking area or outside room for them. What will it be when we bind the smoker smoking in the restaurants? They might share their smoke outside the door or worse, in their house. If they had children, then the seeds of lung cancer might root in the babies' body, and also, including their mom. If you think smoke in the outdoor will be better, then you are wrong. The smoke still exist and will spread widely. To combine people smoke indoor looks good to the 'don't smoke' people, actually, we need to think more carefully. Maybe the answer is defiantly opposite. If the restaurant have the area for smoker only, the don't smoker will not be there then they will not have the doubt of being to the second-smokers. It's no need for us to having a law to them. The smoker won't decrease; the second-smoking won't ease. We need to find a better way to balance the right of the smoker, no smoker. I believe there still have many ways that can solve this problem and it's better than just forbid their freedom of motive.
