There can be several kinds of people in a restaurant such as kids, elders, teenagers, and adults. We can never know if someone has a problem with smoke coming out from cigarettes. But we all know for sure about the toxic elements in cigarette smoke which will never benefit your health and, of course, anyone else's too. And I don't think that smoking in the restaurant benefits at all cost. Many restaurants are not an open-air, so if someone smokes inside the smoke can go around that area, everyone gets that smoke. Even the open-air restaurants people who sit around a smoking person still can get the smoke. The person who smokes may not think that smoking is bad, or even not care about who is going to be effected when they light a cigarette. Besides, the percentage of non-smoking people is much more than the smoking people. So if it is allowed to smoke in a restaurant, the non-smoking people might not go into that restaurant. And that would be bad for the restaurant itself. The obvious example is me. Whenever I smell the cigarette smoke I would have a headache, and I will walk out of that area with no hesitation. Therefore, I strongly agree with the opinion "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country".
