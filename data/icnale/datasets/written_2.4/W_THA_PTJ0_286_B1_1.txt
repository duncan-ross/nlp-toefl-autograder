In my personal point of view, only study is not good for student. It is like you do not open your worldview. Doing other activities provide more benefits for college students. I think that college students can do a part time job during their studying because it is a great opportunity to gain new experience in their life. And the students can apply this experience to the future work. Moreover, they can get some money from doing a part time job. If someone works hard, they may get a lot of money to support their life. In addition, it is a better way of college students to practice the skills they study outside class such as communication skill when they have to communicate with their colleague and their boss at work place. They can face new people, new friends and new world not only the world in their university. One important thing is that a part time job can improve self -discipline. The students have to manage their time properly if they want to do a part time job. So, it will not affect their studying. When we feel tired from work, we do not want to do anything more. You can imagine that if students have a test or homework, people who have good responsibility will deal with this task appropriately. All of this is just positive advantages of doing a part time job of college students.
