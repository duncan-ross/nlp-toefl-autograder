Nowadays, it is not surprised for us to see that a university students works as a part-time tutor in a tutorial centre or a sales in a boutique. However, I don't think it is vital for university students to have a part-time job. The main responsibility of university students is to concentrate on their studies. The subjects of university is far more difficult and complicated than those in high schools, students should devote more time on studying and doing assignments rather than putting effort on their part-time jobs in order to strive for a better academic performance. Someone may claim that it is good for university student to gain some working experience through a part-time job. But I think the objective for most of the university students to take a part-time job is just to earn extra money for their entertainment instead of having a precious working experience. Indeed, they can take an internship during summer holiday if they really want to have working experience. Having a part-time job is not necessary for university students, it just provides additional money for them. However, it will reduce the time for students to study which has a detrimental effect on the academic performance of students.
