They are as teenagers have big spirit to do everything in life. There are many advantages if college students have a part time job. First, college students need more experiences in society cause they will live in society later. The experience is the best teacher, so more much experience they get, better for themselves. Second, the courses schedule of the college students are not to full, so they can do something useful in the free time with have a part time job.
