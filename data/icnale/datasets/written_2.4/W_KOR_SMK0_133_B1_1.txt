Smoking in restaurants on the feedback I have dawned must feel good about yourself is the opposite. I am a good person by nature but is a smoker. So, public places like restaurants do not smoke, not the other way around. Because I am not a smoker but is anyone else. Hates the smell of cigarettes is biheupyeonjaneun. Children in the restaurant again because that makes more. Children are still growing deoldoeeotgittaemune more harmful cigarettes. One smoke in the restaurant again is not an absolute courtesy. No matter how the defendant, even if you want a cigarette to go out there and also there's one essential. I want the defendant tobacco smoke, smoking in restaurants in the interests of Naha and the other because a lot of people would see the damage. I have the concept is very selfish because: The restaurant is one of the foods makes it very sacred. Therefore, its fine for food and the exhaust smells like cigarettes is able to tolerate the cigarette smoke; exhaust the food is very bad for you. Falling quality of taste has worsened mood becomes very unpleasant. I do this for two weeks because I need to quit unconditionally agree to the dining room is in!
