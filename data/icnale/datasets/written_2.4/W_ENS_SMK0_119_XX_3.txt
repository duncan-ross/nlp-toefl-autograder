I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants in Japan. This belief springs from an awareness of the harm that smoking does not only to the smoker, but to persons in the surrounding area as a result of secondhand smoke. Not only is it unhealthy to have nearby persons smoking while one is eating, but cigarette smoke also detracts from the pleasantness and hygiene of the environment. When smoking was first banned from restaurants in the United States, there was a huge outcry from both smokers and the owners of the eating establishments. Restaurant owners believed that business would plunge. Later studies showed, however, that there was no effect whatsoever on business performance figures, and that public opinion strongly supported the move. Today, restaurants are cleaner and more hygienic, and provide an attractive atmosphere more conducive to leisurely conversation as a result of the ban on smoking. Public smoking also sets a poor example for children and young people, who see smoking as a natural part of everyday activities rather than being educated in the harm caused by cigarette smoke. Overall, banning smoking in restaurants and other public places contributes to improved health, cleanliness, and atmosphere. I strongly believe that Japan should follow the model set by restaurants in other countries, and should initiate a complete ban on smoking in restaurants.
