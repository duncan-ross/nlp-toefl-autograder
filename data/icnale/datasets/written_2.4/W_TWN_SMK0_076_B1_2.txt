It is quite normal to see so many warning signs around the public, saying that smoking is banned with the maximum fine of ten thousand dollars. Being a guy who hates smoking and people who smoke, I strongly insist smoking should be banned in the restaurants in my country. According to the news and research, people who inhale the second-hand smokes would get more chances to get the lung cancer than those who smoke, so this issue has been controversially discussed and regulated. Because it has to do with people's health and rights to get healthy, I believe in the regulation of these rules. In my memory, I once had a quarrel with an old man who smokes publicly in the department store, and he was scolded to silence by me and the passer-by. In the long run, he put out the smokes and ran away with understanding the severe consequence a smoker should deserve. Recently, the complete ban to smoke has been carried out in campus around the country as well, showing that smoking in public places in not available Nowadays. Consequently, I would clap my hand and applaud for the ban of smoking in the public places, especially restaurants, and in that way everyone can enjoy the delicious food and "healthy" surroundings without any detriment smokes bring.
