I base my argument on the fact that scientific studies have shown that smoke from cigarettes cause a series of debilitating illnesses. In addition, people inhaling second-hand smoke also suffer from these illnesses. Examples include heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and so on. Thus, I argue that smoking should be completely banned. A person that exercises free will to smoke, even when he knows that smoking is harmful, may do so. However, his act should not affect the lives of others, which he cannot do so. Him smoking in a restaurant will lead to other patrons around him breathing in second hand smoke. Thus, even though these patrons take part in the ill effects of smoking, they had no agency in affecting the initial decision to smoke. Considering this, the rightful way should be to ban smoking in enclosed settings, where smoke necessarily is inhaled by others in close vicinity. Some may say that this violates the free will of people's choice of expression. To that, I retort that when one's free will violates that of others, especially when bodily harm is involved, such free will has to be revoked on a conditional basis. That is, he would not be totally banned from smoking. Only in certain areas, will he be forced to stop.
