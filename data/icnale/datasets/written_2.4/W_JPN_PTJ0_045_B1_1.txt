I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons. First reason is that college students need much money for their study, hobby, and so on. If they earn no money, their parents have to spend all of them, which is hard for them. Even if it is little, they should spend their own money. Second reason is that they can get good experiences by having a part-time job before they start to work as adults. Whatever the part-time job they choose, they can learn that how hard to earn money and the value of money truly. Furthermore, they can get skills which differ by the kind of part-time jobs. For example, if they work at a restaurant, they can study how to make dishes, communicate with customer, and the management. They can also get the knowledge of flowers and plants if they work at a flower shop. In order to know the society they belong to, they need to see many kinds of things not only in their college but also out of it. Because of these tow reasons, I agree with the statement that having a part-time job is important for college students.
