I believe that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, as university students must pay the expensive tuition and use money for lunch or transport fee, so, they can do a part time job to lighten the burden of their family. Moreover, having a part time job can get some experiences. The university students can choose the part time job that can help them to prepare their future career. These experiences can widen their view. For example, if they be a tutor of the primary student or secondary student, they can learn how to teach children and how to prepare material for the children during the lessons. In addition, being a university student is not same as a secondary student, so, doing the part time job is a addition task for university students to arrange their time table. In the university, there are some job for them to do, for example, being a librarian or being a helper of some program. They should use these few years to learn how to arrange their time table that not same as secondary school. In conclusion, having a part time job is important for university students.
