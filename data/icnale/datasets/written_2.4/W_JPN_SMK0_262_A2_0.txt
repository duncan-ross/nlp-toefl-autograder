First of all, saying my opinion about Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I agree with this idea. I also think smoking should be completely banned at all public places and I want to say to all smokers, If you want to smoke a cigarette, please smoke at your private place! There are two reasons why I say terribly about smoking. First reason, generally, non-smokers dislike the smell of the smoke of a cigarette. We, non-smokers, don't want to have a smell of the smoke of a cigarette and feel bad at a public place as a restaurant. An ordered dish also tastes bad. Second reason, breathing the smoke floating from a point of a cigarette (called passive smoking) has very bad influence for our body, especially young children. A lot of young children visit a restaurant, so it can also be said that it's crime to smoke a cigarette and let harmful smoke float at such a place. By the above mentioned two reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants. And I hope that smoking be completely banned at all public places, a campus of the college, a platform, and so on.
