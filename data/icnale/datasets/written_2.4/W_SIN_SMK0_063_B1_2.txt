It is common knowledge that smoking is detrimental to health. Although smoking is a personal choice, it can become a public affair especially when the smoke is inhaled as second-hand smoke, which is equally harmful as smoking directly. This reason in itself is substantial enough to call for a ban of smoking in public areas. In Singapore, the prohibition of smoking has gradually been extended from hawker centers to void decks. However, there still remain areas that the law does not cover. One of these areas is the bus stop, especially when it is crowded, one person smoking can easily cause irritation to all the other people waiting for the bus. Of course, one may say that it is unethical to ban smoking in public places. After all, smoking is a personal choice, and by placing a ban, it is tantamount to infringing upon the personal rights of that person. However, it must be noted that in this case, the right of choosing to smoke is not infringed. The smoker still can smoke; just that he is limited to smoking only on his own property. Smoking in restaurants not only causes health hazards, but also poses a risk to the cleanliness of the food served as well as the general ambience of the restaurant. Surely no one wants to eat in a restaurant that has smoke all round? Thus, it is not unethical to ban smoking in restaurants. In fact, it is ethical, because only then can the good of the majority by maximized.
