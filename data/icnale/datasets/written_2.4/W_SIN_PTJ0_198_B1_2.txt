I disagree with the statement. This is because as students, it is our job to study and focus on what we are doing. Doing a part-time job at the same time will drain our energy and attention while we are in school. I have friends who were always pre-occupied with making money and holding several part-time jobs who frequently skipped school so that he could go for his job. In the end, towards the examinations their grades suffered and could not graduate in time. Further some of the jobs such as delivering flyers and knocking on every house to make sales of products is a very tiring job and when students go to school the following day they are often too tired to pay attention in school, and can always be seen sleeping in class. This defeats the purpose of going to school in the first place. As students we should enjoy being students, spend within our limits, be contend with what our parents provide us and not compare with our peers. We should not hold part-time jobs. The positive side of the students that have a part-time job is that I find that they are much more mature due to the working experience that they have. 207 words
