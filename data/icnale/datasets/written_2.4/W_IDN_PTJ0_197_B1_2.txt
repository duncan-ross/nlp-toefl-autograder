I disagree that college students need to have a part time job. I think it is not too important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students should focus on their study in university. If they are doing a part-time job, of course they might have not focus and then they will get a bad mark on test. They also cannot do their assignment properly. Maybe they have all experience by doing a part-time job but for what they do the entire part-time job if on the last they do not pass their college? It will waste their time. They will waste their money too, of course. In this century, all students need a title for their future. All the job vacancy requires S1 title minimum, and a lot of people have it with a good mark. If we do not have a good mark, we won't compete them all. If your parents already have some job to do (good job for their future), don't hang on it too. We don't know what will happen it the future, right? So prepare yourself for unexpected events. After pass the college, go find a job with all the qualification that you have before.
