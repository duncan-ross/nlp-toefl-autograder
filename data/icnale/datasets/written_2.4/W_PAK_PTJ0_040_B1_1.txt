In this universe some people are poor and some people are rich. Poor people have limited income and they are even some time not able to educate their children. Some poor people through thick or thin educate their children to do jobs and improve their living. Children who are studying and they are poor and they have to pay their fee so, they have to do job. So, I am totally in faviour of part time jobs for college students. Students doing part time jobs set their time table and they manage their time and study also. People doing part time jobs have good results but some cannot manage time so, their education is affected. There are some people who are fond of study and are poor so, they study also with job. So, in this case part time jobs are good for poor children. Government should give funds to these poor children to help them, improve their living and continue their education. Children should be passionate so they can manage both education and job. Education is very important for people so they must get education though they are poor by doing part time job.
