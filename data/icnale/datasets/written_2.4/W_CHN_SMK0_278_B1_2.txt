 Smoking, once considered a shameful thing, however, receives the popularity among the young generation in contemporary society. And it seems to be a culture that the young, especially the students in middle school, smoke extensively. Having their ears pierced, wearing worn-out jeans, with a cigarette hanging between their lips and so on, these young boys (maybe including a few badly-behaved girls )are just trying to change their style, or to look the part of their favorite pop singers or movie stars. They feel smoking makes them look cooler. As we all know, smoking brings about a large amount of disadvantages. First, it does harm to our body health, it can increase the chances of lung disease. Next, those who can't afford buying cigarettes with their pocket money may steal or rob, thus forming awful characters. At length, some of them are so addicted to smoking that they feel uncomfortable when they don't smoke. This will certainly affect their study, in a word, they're ruining their future. On the other hand, the young who smoke heavily are innocent on further reflection. Our society should be responsible for the score-oriented education. The failure to guide the young generation to realize the correct value of life, not only does harm to their health, but discourages their pure soul. They should seriously think about what is truly beautiful and what value we should pursue. However, I do believe, with the efforts of school teachers and the government, the possibility of breathing in fresh air rather than second-hand smoke will come true.
