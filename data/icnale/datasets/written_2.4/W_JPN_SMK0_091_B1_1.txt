I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons about it. First I do not like tobacco's smell. I always see the people that smoke around Turumai Park and Nagoya university hospital. I think that Tobacco's smell is very bad. When I go though their people, I get bad feeling. So when I go though their people, I always stop breathing during going though them. Second smoking is dangerous for people that are around a smoking man. Smoking affects bad for a smoking man. But, smoking affects a smoking man more than a man that are around a smoking man. Nicotine which is contained of tobaccos has reliance. And tobacco contains of a lot of toxic substance. So when we breathe where there are tobaccos, we tend to get diseases more than we live in nothing of tobacco. So I think that tobacco is dangerous drug. Tobacco is nothing of good effect to us. So I want to ban smoking not only at all the restaurants in the country, bad also all over Japan. That is why I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
