Nowadays most students have taken part-time jobs during their study time of college. They will do everything when they have free time and in weekend they also spend time on their part-time jobs. In my opinion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, I think do part-time job can help college students learn to budget money. In China, many students' money was given by their parents. They can't know how hard to earn money, so they spend money quickly and waste money to buy meaningless things. But if they have a part-time job to do, they will find it is difficult to earn money themselves. They will budget money if they want use them. Secondly, a part-time job can help them pay for their living things. Such as food, books clothes and so on. They will feel success if they use their own money. Thirdly, doing a part-time job can help them to build their character and gather social experience. It can help them grow up. In today's society, it is hard to find a good job. Many jobs need experience person. In generally, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It has many advantages for college students. It can help them strength faith.
