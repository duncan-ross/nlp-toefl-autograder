It should not be banned at all in Japan or anywhere else, at least not by governments. It's a personal choice and it is up to the restaurant bosses and their customers to decide, not governments. How much regulatory power do we want governments to have anyway? We vote the governments into power, we pay their overly large salaries and pay for all their perks too. They work for us or at least that's the way it is supposed to be. Let adults decide for themselves how they want to conduct business, provided that it is not illegal of course. What's the problem with that anyway? If people don't want to go to a smoking restaurant, then don't go. It's that easy really. Forcing people to go here, go there, don't do this and don't do that, is childish and taking away their basic human rights. As adults, we get to choose which restaurant we would like to eat at but some people argue that we should be told what to do when we get there. I mean, come on! Sounds dictatorial to me and what about the people who do smoke? Sure, they shouldn't go around blowing smoke where it is not welcome, but they are entitled to have somewhere to go to the same as non-smokers are. Get real Japan. Don't do it!
