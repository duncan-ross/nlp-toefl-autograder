As a university student, I think we need a part-time job. It is not only for earning pocket money, but also for our adult life. We can learn many other precious things from our part-time job. I still remember my first part-time job. It is a sales assistant. At the beginning, it is difficult to survive, I just wanted to go home. It is hard to picture that I need to stand for ten hours in the same place, it is so boring. Apart from this, all colleagues in the retail store are experienced, only I am new and without any experience. I do not what I need to do, so I just keep standing and facing our customers without doing anything but pretending to smile. Luckily, my colleagues are kind, they always taught me how to service different customers. They are willing to help me in all means, therefore, I could finish my first day safely but I am really very tired at that night. No matter how tired I am, I still need to wake up at 7 a. m. and have another working day. Although this job is hard to do, I still alive. It means I can handle it. As the time go on, I have finished my first part-time job. When I think about those time, I feel very happy and memorable which I can not get from university. And I improved my interpersonal skills and communication skills while at work, and made some new friends. I am pleasure to have my first part time job. If I just keep studying in the university, I can not get so much. Lastly, I agree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job.
