I don't aggree this statements, because it's a must to do in somewhere. I think it is a rest time in restaurants usually, and it's a good timeing to smoke in a day. "After your eating, smoking is a best thing to do, and you will fell happily. ", someone said it, so it's a difficult rule in every restaurants. In majority city's restaurants, I think it a standard rule that dom's smoke. In some village, there have a lot of farmer or factory hand, If the restaurant stop them to smoke, I think they may have no customers in they restaurant. Someone use smoke to release, so it difficult to stop, such as drugs. Everyone know smoke is not a good thing, buy why they are still in our live, it's a interesting thing to explore. Entertainment is a release way, and someone consider smoke is a relasew way, so they could not stop to smoke. In some smokers, they stop smoke, because they want to make someone happily or healthly, someone could feel normal air, not the secondhand smoke, and they can be a healthly. In conclusion, it's a difficult thing to achieve soppting smoke. Everyone need some way to release they stress, smoke is a one of ways to do, so it's not a easy thing.
