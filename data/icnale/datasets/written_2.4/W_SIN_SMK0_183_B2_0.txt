We must first understand that smoking is a largely harmful activity, bringing diseases to the smoker and is a nuisance to others. However, many are still addicted to the habit of smoking, and feel the urge to smoke frequently. Banning smoking in all restaurants gives non-smokers a smoke-free environment to dine. For the smokers, however, it means that they will have to either stop their smoking habit while dining, or excuse themselves to find alternative locations to smoke during meals. As smoking is a die-hard habit, the latter is usually more prominent. Additionally, we have to understand the motivation behind banning smoking in all restaurants. Is it because the government wants to reduce the harm that smoke brings to non-smokers? Or is it due to the fact that the government wants to eradicate the habit of smoking in its population by setting up barriers to smoking? If the former is the case, the new law might help, ensuring a smoke-free dining environment. However, if the latter is the case, it might have very limited effects. Ban smoking in restaurants, and smokers will take their smoking to another place. As long as the intention of smoking is there, smokers will find a way to do so, unless if there is a strong barrier set up. Banning in restaurants only is, however, not a strong one. As such, I believe that whether to ban smoking in all restaurants depends on the motivation behind it, and whether there are any complementary policies to support the motivation.
