I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoking in restaurants is a very bad thing to do, it will affect many people's health. Actually, not only in restaurants, smoking is unhealthy anyway. We all know that smoking will damage our lungs and badly affect our health. Smoking may also cause cancers. Moreover, smoking will make people's fingers and teeth go yellow, it will affect smokers' appearance. Furthermore, smoking is not harming the smokers only, people around the smokers will be affected too. Effects of passive smoking are seriously worse than the original smokers since the smoke gets in their body without any filtering. Restaurants always are airtight areas, and tables are always close. If you smoke, big amount of people will be force to have passive smoke. People can choose to leave the smokers far away while both of them are outside, but they cannot choose when they are in restaurants. Moreover, smoke is easier to get in their body while they keep opening their mouth to eat. Also, there will be many children in the restaurants, children having passive smoke can be very serious since their body are still developing. Other than that little bit of excitement, smoking only has disadvantages. Smoking is a harmful and selfish thing to do, it is not good to smoke anywhere especially in restaurants.
