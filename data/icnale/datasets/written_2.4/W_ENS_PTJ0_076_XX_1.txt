I agree with this statement that students in college should have a part-time job. However, I think that a college student should only have a part-time job if they can find one that relates to their major. It is kind of a waste of time to do anything that wouldn't really help you in graduating from college, and the fact of the matter is that if you can find a part-time job that is related to your major, you'll gain valuable experience and probably also make more money than you would at a job that is completely unrelated to your major. A part-time job gives you the opportunity to develop crucial skills like responsibility and money management while you're still young so that you will not have to worry about these after you graduate. You already have developed the skills to a point where they are nearly second nature, so you'll be miles ahead of the other students who are just beginning to discover these problems after they graduate. Lastly, a part-time job is a good thing to list on your resume because it shows that you were good enough at school to have enough time to engage in another pursuit.
