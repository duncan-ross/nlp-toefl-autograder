There is a heated debate on the rationality of smoking in restaurant. Some people are strongly against smoking in every restaurant while others insist that smoking in restaurants should be allowed for reasons below. The former says that smoking does harm to people. It can cause some deadly diseases such as lung cancer. Be it smokers or second-hand smokers, their health is all at risk. Besides, they consider that restaurants are public places where people want to have fun. If smoking is allowed in restaurants, the non-smokers may get annoyed and fail to have their meals with joy as they want. The latter takes it for granted that smoking should be allowed in restaurants for several reasons. First, smokers have the freedom to deal with their own business. They pay for the foods and service so that they ought to enjoy their time in restaurants. Second, smokers pay a high tax to government, so they believe that they make contribution to society. Smoking is the rights they get in return. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in every restaurant as soon as possible. Not only smoking does harm to smokers, but it also affects non-smokers' health. To ban smoking in restaurants will be a double-win choice.
