Smoking has always known to be bad to health. In fact, there is no good arguments, nor acceptable arguments, for anyone to argue for smoking as a beneficial activity. Smoking is bad, and second-hand smoking is even more harmful to our body. This is why I do agree strongly that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Although it is up to the individual to pick up smoking, and there can be no law enforced which forces smokers to quit smoking, smokers should be considerate to the non-smokers. It is their choice to ruin their health, however, it is not right to aggravate the health of the innocent people who are around them when they are smoking. Especially in Singapore where restaurants are usually air-conditioned and enclosed, smoking should all the more be banned to prevent the public from breathing in the toxic smoke. Moreover, restaurants, being a public area, should be a place that is comfortable for everyone to be in. Being completely banned might give rise to protests from smokers, and they may even resort to gathering outside the restaurant to take their smoke break. Nevertheless, this should not deter us from trying to enforce a comfortable and healthy dining environment for everyone. In addition, there is also a pertinent need to convey the importance of being considerate, as well as the harmful effects of smoking and second-hand smoking, to the smokers.
