Today the part time job is very important for college students. I honestly think that it is a awesome, great idea for students to have part time jobs before they graduate from college. But if they had the time and resources to do so. If college students do the part time job, they can get experience. Because today for every professional job the experience is required. So for this, internship is very good achievement. Through this students become experienced for professional jobs. Besides this education has become very expensive now in our country. Our admission feces are very high. So in order to continue our education, the part time job is necessary. In this way students can pay there college dues, hostel dues etc. But all students can not do the part time jobs in well manners. Some week students feel very much burden can not pay proper attention to there study. Because of this some parents stop their children to do part time job. But some students may be able to balance college work and office work, without harming there education, but they are minority. I think if weak students do part time job, it ca be make them responsible about every thing. For example they become able to use money with in a budget. They come to know that how they can manage the time for study and job. So I think all the students should do the part time job for there better future life, if they have resources.
