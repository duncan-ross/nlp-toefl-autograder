I believe part-time job is not necessary for us college students. Firstly, in the college, acquiring knowledge is the main point. College is not the end of the study, on the contrary, it is just a new start of life. We need to study and live with our own. Most of us are not short of money, because our parents could support our basic life. So, finding a part-time job and affording our life are not the most important things. Also, part-time job in college can not bring us a lot of money, while, if we study hard, we may use our knowledge to create much more wealth in the future. Secondly, the society is much more complex than we considered. What we have learnt about and our experience are not enough, we may possibly be cheated when we try to find a part-time job. What's worse, our equity could be encroached on. That's not worth the candle. Thirdly, if we want to do the part-time job for working experience, we can choose the student union or some other organizations founded by college. It's safe and efficient. Also, we can ask for volunteer work, we ought not to think too much of money. Volunteering is always a great way to get progress for us students. Having taken all into consideration, for some whose family has financial burden, part-time job may be a good choice. But for most of us, I think part-time job is unnecessary. Studying hard is the most important thing, without 'one of'.
