About smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I think it is a right policy. We can think from the topic of health, environment and polite. The first from public place, public place is an open space all people can stay and have a rest over their, so they must be respected. Therefore, it must be banned at open space, like restaurants. In Taiwan, it is banned at partial restaurants, if they have one more people in the restaurants, the smokers have smoke should be in smoke area not in non-smoke area. Because they product extra-cost, like pollution, bad intergradient and the smell not smelled good. But should smoking completely be banned at all the restaurants in the country? It will bring the smokers have more inconvenient and not respect in the society. I think smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. But the government and legislators should be offer great places and set a completely rules for the smokers. It can make non-smokers suffering from the dangerous environment and the smokers smoke having a place or area. A good policy should have completely and sympathy cases for all of people.
