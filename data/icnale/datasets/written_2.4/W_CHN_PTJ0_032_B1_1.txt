As college students, we leave our hometown and go to new places to study. Also, we try our best to live on our own feet. In this case, many students apply for part time jobs to support themselves. So does the time spent on part time jobs really deserve?On one hand, the advantages stand out. Through part time job, students can get some money for school and daily life. And to students in need of money, it is just necessary. Then students can get good experience both academically and socially. With more contact to the society, students learn more about out-school life. What's more, part-time job helps students develop good working habits and communicating skills that are really useful for future work. On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages; first, inexperienced job-hunting may bring students artificial information and waste money and confidence. Then the second disadvantage is that many students spend too much time working so that they leave behind others in studies. To conclude, every coin has its two sides. So is the part-time job. If we deal with it carefully, we care sure to make the most of it. My personal idea is to take suitable part-time job when you really need or want to gain experience. But everybody has his own situation, so just do not follow others blindly.
