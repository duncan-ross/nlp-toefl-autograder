I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When I went to Japan, I saw many of Japanese smoking in the restaurant. As a foreigner, I couldn't say too much about that. But in Taiwan, still lots of people smoke in public places. The smell really makes me uncomfortable and dizzy, and so do those people who are not smoke. Especially restaurant is for eating. If smoking is allowed in restaurant, there must be lots of people that cannot eat comfortably. When discussing this kind of question, some people may say that ban smoking is not good to human rights. But second-hand smoke will not only hurt smoker's health, but also other people's health. Also, environment will become worst and worst, and then hurt more people body. It is true that people have freedom to do what they want to do, but if it will hurt others, then it shouldn't be allowed. If smokers really can stop smoking and want to smoke sometimes, they can just go to a place that is only prepared for smokers. They will have 100% freedom if they are willing to smoke there. So maybe restaurant can set a smoking area for smokers, but not let them smoking in normal public area.
