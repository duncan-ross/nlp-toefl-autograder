Nowadays, more and more college students are trying to do part-time jobs out of school. This has become a common phenomenon. Some of them are to earn money, while others are to gain more experience. Maybe some people will hold the view that doing a part-time job influences students' study. That may be reasonable. However, part-time jobs have more positive influences in my mind. On one hand, students can learn more useful things by doing a part-time job. As we know, students need to make a living by themselves one day. It is of great significance to make them learn to depend on themselves. Taking a part-time job can let them know more skills which are useful in their future lives. On the other hand, students can use their own money to support their study by taking part-time jobs. Most of the college students only use the money which is given by their parents. I think students will be proud of using the money earned by themselves. Also their parents will feel proud of their own son or daughter. From the reasons above, it is obvious that doing a part-time job does more good effects on students. It is really an important lesson that students deserve to learn.
