Part time job plays an important role in college students' lives. There are a lot of reasons for getting a part time job. Some people need to earn money to support their family. Some people want to save money for their favorite clothes or notebooks. Some people just want to have such experiences to know what it is like after they graduate. However, no matter why you have a part time job and no matter what kind of job you have, all you need to do is to strike a perfect balance between your work and study. There are several examples that students work so hard that they forget they are still students. They go to work for 3-4 hours every day after school. They spend too much time on it to study any more. Surely, they are destined to be flunked and, to make matters worse, they cannot stay in college. However, it is not worth earning money instead of studying hard in their age. If they study hard and have sufficient knowledge, they are naturally well-prepared to get a better full-time job rather than a part-time job which offer little money. They need to study harder for their better future. To conclude, although students are encouraged to have a part-time job, because they can learn what are not in textbook and be more mature, they need to manage their time well.
