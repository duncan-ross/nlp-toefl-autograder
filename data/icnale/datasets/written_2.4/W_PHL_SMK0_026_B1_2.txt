Yes, I definitely agree that smoking should be banned, but not just in all the restaurants. Smoking should be banned everywhere, for the main reason that it is dangerous to one's health, not only for the smoker, but also for the person who inhales the smoke from the cigarette. I believe that every person should be sensitive enough and should care for other person's health, not just for their pleasure. They say that smoking is one way to ease their stress, and for them to forget their problems. But for me, cigarette smoking doesn't solve problems; it only makes things worst. You might not see it at first, but smoking kills the smoker slowly inside. One thing that should also be banned is the commercials that have something to do with people smoking. Media should be used to promote good health, and not products which destroys life. Every time you smoke, your life span shortens. Life is too short; why make it shorter? We should enjoy every moment we have to live life to the fullest and not just waste it over things that destroy us. Our life is a gift from God, so we should take care of it and love it.
