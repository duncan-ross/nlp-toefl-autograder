To spend the life at the university is clearly different from the high school or Mattayom. The very important thing that everybody would think of is the expense at the university. Nowadays, many students have a part time job. I think that it could be important because the expenses in the university's life is very high. Many students are not wealthy themselves, so they might find the way to get money. The part time job could be the first way that they choose. I think for the college students, it should be important because it could help the student to gain more money and it also help their parents about the expenses of family. Some students can earn a lot of money from a part time job. Sometimes it is more than the money that they get from their family. But for the students who are wealthy themselves, it might not be so important because that their money is enough for month. Therefore, the part time job could not be important for them. Most of those student who work for the part time job. I think they could not find any way to gain the money. By the way, the student should be careful when they work because it could disturb their studying skills and the leisure time. finally, I personally think that the part time job is quite necessary to the students because it could help their parents about the expense at the university.
