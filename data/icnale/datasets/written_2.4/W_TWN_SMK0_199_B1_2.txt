I disagree with the statement: smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons for why I don't agree with it. First, basically, smoking is not illegal in my country. Therefore, I think ban smoking in the restaurant is not reasonable. Also, we didn't set up any law which says that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Second, in my opinion, it is sure to say that smoking is not healthy at all. However, we can divide restaurants into two areas--smoking and non-smoking instead of completely ban it. Some people don't care others smoking or not, why they often frown at those who with cigarettes is because they hate the smell. As a result, making them dine in different area may be a good way. Third, if smoking is completely banned, it must be difficult for managers in restaurants to control. We can try to imagine a picture: a customer is drunk after dining, then, he start to smoke. The waiter tells him it is not allowed to smoke here. However, because of alcohol, the customer doesn't accept waiter's saying, what's worse, they begin to argue! This condition might really happen, won't it? There are lots of argument between pros and cons on this issue. Before an appropriate and complete resolution is set, I disagree with completely ban smoking in the restaurants.
