Being an asthmatic, I have an inherent unsuitability in smoke-filled environments and this has developed in me displeasure towards smokers in public. I sincerely believe that smoking should be disallowed in restaurants in Singapore because it only serves to pleasure the smoker himself at the expense of all other people in the area. Firstly, neighbouring tables and ultimately the entire restaurant will be engulfed in second-hand smoke. Not only does this affect the health of fellow patrons as well as staff of the restaurant, it also dampens the atmosphere in the place. Just imagine going on a first date, thinking that all will be good with a nice setting, great food and great service. All is achieved, but you and your partner had to inhale nicotine and tar and their accompaniment of toxins. And you two leave the place with stinky hair and clothes, and an increased chance of contracting lung cancer. Not the best ending for a first date, is it? Secondly, because smoking affects one's taste buds, smoking in a restaurant prevents enjoyment of the dishes painstakingly prepared by the chef. Not only does the diner not taste the meal in its intended flavours, the act of smoking flushes all the chefs' efforts of experimenting and preparing down the drain. Not only does it not do the diner justice, it is being highly disrespectful to the chef as well. One may argue that smoking helps clinch deals in corporate meetings, but it is simply unfathomable to me that killing both parties slowly works better than healthy interaction. But of course, the human rights argument. The government may want to look into the creation of smoking chambers like at some international airports, which would allow smokers their moment of lung pollution without affecting their fellow human beings.
