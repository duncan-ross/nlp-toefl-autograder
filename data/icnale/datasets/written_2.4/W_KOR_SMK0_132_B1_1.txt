I strongly agree with non smoking in the restaurants. Many people find the restaurant customers are in danger of secondhand smoke. The profits are very varies in the restaurant that non smoking. Instead of losing one smoker, you are newly got two non skmoker. Non-smokers to smoke after a meal or simply do not happen to need a coffee refill. Reservation business of customers and seat contrariety works etc. . are simple. You raise turnover of customers, and you let you shorten greatly atmosphere time of customers in peak time. Diminishes the risk of fire in a restaurant, it reduces the burden of the risk of fire insurance premiums. The carpet or floor of the restaurant by the burn marks tables, etc. . does not drop cigarette ashes. Cleaning of the employees and the employer's burden is reduced cleaning costs. A curtain, a wall, a floor, washing of households etc. or replacement cost decrease. Reduces the employee's sick leave, productivity increases. The ability to prefer a more pleasant working environment for staff to get the employee also has the advantage of being easier. Customers and employees, reducing the burden of responsibility for health. Customers in a pleasant environment for meals and eat more than happy to be enjoyed.
