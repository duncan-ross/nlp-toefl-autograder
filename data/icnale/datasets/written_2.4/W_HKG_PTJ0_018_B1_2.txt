Many parents claim that students should focus on their study. True, studying is of prime importance to a student. However, focusing on studying solely is not enough to a university student. It is also important for university students to have a part-time job. University students will jump into the job market very soon. Working experience is one of the concerns of employers. Having a part-time job equips undergraduates for their future as they are preferable to employers than the one who has no working experience. It will be one of the advantages surely if students have part-time job in university life. Students will become more mature if they have working experience. Under the protection of parents, many university students do not understand the hardships of working. In workplace, they have to solve the problems by themselves. Through the part-time job, they will become more independent. Furthermore, they have to cooperate with different groups of people, such as different ages and different positions. Some of the communication skills learnt from this cannot be learnt from schools. I am not denying that university students should not focus on their study. However, studying should not be the only concern. It is also very important for university students to broaden their horizon before graduation.
