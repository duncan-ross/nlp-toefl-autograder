Smoking is one of the worst habits an individual would have. It is commonly known that it is hazardous to our health as well as it gives disadvantages to our environment. Smoking does not only affect the smokers but it even gives more bad effect to the non-smokers. Smoking has become very common and fashionable, especially among young boys. It is a must that smoking be banned from all restaurants because as we all commonly know that smoking is dangerous to our health as well as in our environment. It also gives improper ambiance to the customers and even gives lost appetite to the customers. We know that, restaurant is almost an extension of our house, wherein, there are children that gives allergy to them. It also affects the cleanliness both air and the surroundings. As others inhale the emission of the smokers gives more harmful affect to those who were able to inhale it. Actually, in some other areas of our country smoking ban was already imposed in all public restaurants. Despite the warnings given by doctors about the ill-effects of smoking, people continue to smoke. Smokers are addicted to it; they cannot refrain from picking up a cigarette and puffing away. Some youngsters smoke for the sake of society and would make them appear liberated. As a non-smoker, I see no any advantages of having a habit of the subject except of gaining big taxes by the government. By imposing huge taxes to the manufacturers, means a high price of cigarettes. If the price is high, not all individual can afford to buy. So I think the best way to control if not eradicate smoking is to make the price very high where in not all individual can afford especially minor ages where smoking habit is being formulated.
