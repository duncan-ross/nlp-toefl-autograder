Smoking is using a small cylinder stick that created numerous surrounding issues. In our society today, it is already a proven fact that smoking may lead to different health problems. It is also observed from research and experiments that second-hand smokers tend to be more susceptible to graver health-related risks. A law has already been implemented in the Philippines wherein people are designated smoking areas, especially in public places. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, whether is a fine dining restaurant or an informal one. First of all, restaurants are places for food consumption. And these places must always be maintained for them to be clean and neat. On the other hand, cigarettes contain many different chemicals that may contaminate both the food and as well as the bodies of the diners. As mentioned a while ago, second-hand smoking is more dangerous in terms of its health effects. As a result, people may obtain these chemicals into their bodies. I also strongly discourage assigning smoking areas within the vicinity of restaurants. The reason behind this is that the chemicals from cigarettes may travel inside the restaurant and reach the food and the people eating. There may also be cases where the restaurant owners will be held responsible for the diseases their customers may obtain.
