I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is not good for health. There are a lot of dangerous thing in a cigarette that can be affected to health. Most of the restaurants in the country have air-conditionings, so if someone has smoking, the smog will spread all area of the restaurant and it will make annoy to the people who do not smoke. As we can see the affect of smoking or smog from the cigarettes on the television advertising, it shows us that most people will get cancer after they take more smoke. Another reason is restaurant is a place for take a rest after we got tired with our work, so giving a fresh air and enjoy with food, making a good relationship with family members or our friends are the best things. As we know that there are some area for smoking, but it is not appropriate because the smell of cigarettes also spread in the restaurant. The smoker should try to stop smoking when they go to the restaurant or other public places because it wastes their time to do the best things that they want. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
