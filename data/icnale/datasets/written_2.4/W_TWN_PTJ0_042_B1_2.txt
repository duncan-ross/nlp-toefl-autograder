In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. When I was a child, my parents told me that what I did after class should not just all about class. I should do something special and different to realize the world. They said that you won't be a student forever. You should learn something useful for your future life. The reasons why I agree that having a part-time job for college students is important are following below. First of all, my parents said that our life can't only study so having a part-time job is a great way of not just studying. Besides, someone having a part-time job can earn money. It's a way for students to earn money on their own. They can learn how to take use of their money. The last one is that when we have a part-time job, we can make friends with more people. You can learn many things from them by chatting, and learn more about the social. I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. It's a great way to know more about the social. By the way, though I think having a part-time job is important, I still don't want to see that students give up their school works.
