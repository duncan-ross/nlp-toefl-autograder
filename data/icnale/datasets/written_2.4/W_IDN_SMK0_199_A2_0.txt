Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. Every year, thousands of Americans are diagnosed with lung cancer that was brought about specifically from smoking. Most smokers are bombarded with reasons to quit smoking every day, and there are hundreds of quit smoking tips, quit smoking aids and quit smoking support groups. However, none of the ways to quit smoking can work for you if you are not ready to give up your habit. Knowing what cigarette smoking does to you can help you make up your mind to begin your trek toward a healthier life. Cigarette smoking is perhaps the worst thing you could do to your body. There have been a variety of studies that show that smoking shortens your life by six minutes for every cigarette you smoke. When you think about this in terms of packs a day, you are shortening your life by two hours for every pack of cigarettes you smoke. That is quite a sacrifice to make just for smoking. The most dangerous part of cigarette smoking, however, is what it can do to your lungs. Smoking is leading cause of lung cancer in the world. Though non-smokers can also get lung cancer, smokers greatly increase their chances beyond those of non-smoking individuals. Smokers are also at risk for developing emphysema, an incurable breathing disease.
