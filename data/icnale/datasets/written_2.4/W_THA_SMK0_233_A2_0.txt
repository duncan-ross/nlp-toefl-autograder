Cigarette is a thing like a drug but many people in this world are smoke with no reason. And actually, everybody know good about defect and what will be happen when smoke but them don't care it. Thailand is the same every countries in this world. There have many people smoke and there haven't fix rules for control people to stop it. The little good of Thai rules are warned people by small photo on pack of cigarette, don't sell it to people under 18 years old and can't smoke inside a restaurant and night club. The rule about restaurant or night club, it is for some people don't smoke. May be it's a good rules for manners in restaurant but it nothing for protect our self from smoker. They don't care what a bad thing about smoke is giving to people around them. It's a disease is cancer. Nothing about people smoke or not but when you close around smoker, you will get a smoke of cigarette and it is a bad thing to make you will got cancer. Certainly, nobody wants to dead because of cancer. So, Smoking should completely ban at all the restaurant in the country was very good to do.
