I agree that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking has bad effects on us. I will give three problems of smoking. First, the physical problem is. As you know, the smokers are apt to have cancer of lungs. This is owing to nicotine and tar. Both of them are dangerous materials. And what is worse, side-stream smoke has more bad effects than mainstream smoke. That is to say, even non-smokers have a possibility that they have diseases. As other danger, a burn could be given. The fire of tobacco has a possibility that it touches with people. In case of children, it will touch with their faces. Second, the mental problem is. Smokers often say that they become calm when they smoke. However, because it means that they are addicted to nicotine, they will be hard to stop smoking. In addition, they tend to be annoyed when they don't smoke. Third, the financial problem is. The price of tobacco is about three hundred yen. If they are heavy smokers, they pay one thousand yen or more than on a week. In addition, it may raise even five hundred yen in the future. Not only these problems but only other problems will exist. In the end, what I want to say is that smoking never has good effect on us.
