 As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. So the government has banned on smoking on some restaurants. But there are more disputes. Some people approve of it very much. They even think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is more comfortable for the non-speakers, while other people don't think so. In fact, most of them are smokers, they think it is very inconvenient for them to go to the restaurants. In my point of view, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is true that the smoke is harmful to the non-speakers, especially the pregnant people and the child. But the population of smoking is too large. So we cannot ask the government to ban smoking at all restaurants. But there are still some methods. For example, we can imitate the policy from other countries. We can set some smoking areas and no smoking areas in every restaurant. As far as I know, some restaurants have already done it. So in this way, we can protect people's health in public, and we can also let the heavy smokers to have more room. If both sides step back, we can have a better life. So we should't ban on smoking at all restaurants.
