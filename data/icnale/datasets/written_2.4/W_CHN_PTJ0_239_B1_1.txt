 It is normal that teenages have a part-time job in recent, especially high school students and college students. Most of they want to be independent, so some of they chance temporary job. However, they couldn't think that they learn sciences from the books when they are young. In my opinion, they should learn more other things out of book. And then, I express my points. Students do a part-time by many different reasons, such as not well-off, buying some things, getting working experience. And many businessman like taking on them because of their low pay. Although the salary can make them happy in a short time, it has too low effect for the future. Some students chance learning more things in the teen time, I think it is well. They may be no time to learn some important knowledge when they are employment. They will get other skills what the same old person doesn't know by the day past. And they are more powerful then other people in the job. In my conclusion, I wish students get more skills, in stead of money. Because some skills can fill in their life, and lead them to get more money than part-time job.
