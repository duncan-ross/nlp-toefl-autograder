I agree with the statement. I show first reason. I hate smoking. Because smoking smell is very bad. If I see a smoking people at lunch, I feel unhappy and angry. The lunch becomes not delicious. Next, I show second reason. I worry about smoking people. Smoking is disaster for body. Smoking causes death. It is fear. Smoking looks very cool. But, I will not smoking. I want to keep my body healthy. I sometimes meet smoking person on bicycle driving when I drive my bicycle back the person. It is worst situation for me. The smoke flow my face. I must take smoke. I want to stop smoking during driving bicycle. Because, I think that people must not smoke everywhere in Japan. But, I think that some people will not stop smoking. So, we must divide people from smoking people and not smoking people. But, I feel it is sad. I know a good point of smoking. Smoking tax is very high rate in Japan. Smoking people may feel that high smoking tax is very bad. Conclusion I think that smoking people will stop smoking. Because, I think smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan.
