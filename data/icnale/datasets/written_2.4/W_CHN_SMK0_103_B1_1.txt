 I fully agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. In fact, in some countries it has been written in the law and is being carried out now. My reasons are chiefly as follows. First, smoking is harmful to the smoker's health. According to the recent survey, those who smoke are much more likely to get lung cancer than those who don't and every year many people are dying due to diseases caused by smoking habit. In this case, we should not smoke for the sake of our health. Second, smoking not only do harm to the person who smokes but also the tremendous people who suffer from passive smoking. The supporters of smoking often claim that smoking is a kind of personal lifestyle that others even the government should not interfere. However, in my opinion, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, it's no more a personal matter and it not only harm other people's health but also creates a terrible environment for others. Last but not least, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, chances are that a big fire might break out and then threatens the safety of thousands of people. Therefore, no matter it is for your own health or the others', smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the country and it is high time that the government took effective measures to solve the problem.
