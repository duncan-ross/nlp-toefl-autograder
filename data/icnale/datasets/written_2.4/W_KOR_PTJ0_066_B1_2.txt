I'm agreeing for this topic. Too hard to find a part-time job, many people find a part-time job. These days a lot of high school students do part-time job, so university students is not easy to find. Therefore, a long time to find part-time job and we can find we want work for aptitude. Anyway part-time job is so important to us. Especially when compared to interns. If you want employee you are very hard working every day. That means interns changing employee probability is very low. But what about part-time job? Anyone ever will know if part-time job. You can't never ever see the future. But if you find your compare one-hundred percent satisfaction part-time job to you. That is chance maybe fifty-fifty chance. Anyway if you can find part-time job, you will think one more time. Most of parents if they children want to the part-time job, Maybe almost parents to tell disagreed nuance Anyway But I think we're university students that means almost completely grow adult, so part-time job give it to us some help. First, Part-time job is a part of social experience and monthly save money, if you want independence you must have experience in save money Second, if you save a lot of money your parents don't care almost everything that is important thing. Third, you will meet new people, i can make book on meet because that is very amazing you know just simply part-time job Had relationship of boggles the mind.
