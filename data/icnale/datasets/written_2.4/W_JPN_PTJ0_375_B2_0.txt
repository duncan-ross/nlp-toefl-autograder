Even though there may be some advantages to having a part-time job, I think it is not important for college students to do that. There are three reasons; studying time, sleeping time, and being obsessed with money. First, students should use their time for study because their real work is studying. It is a privilege of students to have such a long time to study and improve their skills. In addition, they pay a lot of money for college to attend. Therefore, they should concentrate on their study and do their best. However, part-time job will cut their time for study a lot. I think it is not good for students. Second, some students work for a long time and it cut their time to sleep. There're a many kind of part-time job, and I heard that some students work at bar or pub which open until late at night. Because of that, they work and come back home very late, it prevent them from keeping regular hours. Therefore, in the next morning, they're too sleepy to concentrate on their classes. It makes vicious circle in their lifestyle. Third, there's a possibility of being obsessed with money. In a part-time job, the longer you work, the richer you become. So some students who really want money can be a money-grubber and work hard too much. I think it can motivate them to earn money, but remove their motivation to study. It is very dangerous fact. For all of these reasons, I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
