I would have to say that I agree with this statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan, if it is not already been banned by the time I write this. Smoking causes a myriad of problems for health, and some of the common ones are cancer of the mouth and lungs, heart disease, high blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. We have done an in depth study on the human body in a lab class during my pre med school, and it was absolutely terrifying but also incredibly interesting to see just how damaging smoking was to the body's vital systems. The lungs became smaller, less elastic, and full of fluids. The heart became distended, and it could not as effectively push blood throughout the body. The liver began to develop sores as a result of trying to filter out all the harmful chemicals from the blood. It really was almost terrifying to see how much of the body was affected. When you smoke, you are not just hurting your lungs, you are hurting your whole body. So, if these results come to be well published or distributed in some other manner, even though I'm sure the Japanese already know a lot about this kind of thing, it will make a big step towards banning smoking in restaurants a reality.
