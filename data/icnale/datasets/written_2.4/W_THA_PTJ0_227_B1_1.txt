Part-time job is good way for students. Since the economic downturn I think that students ought to seek part-time jobs. parents can't seem to have enough money to support their children's education fees in the universities or college. So, by working part-time, they can help their parents with their burden. Parents will be proud to have a child helping them to lighten their family burden. Another thing is that by doing part-time jobs, students can get their own allowance. They won't be counting on their parents to get their money to buy their education stuff and their needs. They can just earn their money by doing part-time jobs. At the same time, they can learn to be independent. This will help them when they grow up in the future. it is also a great experience. It also gives you a chance to see what it is like to earn and spend money of your own. Maybe some of them want to prepare for the next jobs, some of them because they couldn't handle with the scholar task and others just for having some extra pocket money. In the end I conclude that having a job while you are teen involves mainly advantages and it would help you a lot in your life but only if you know how to combine it with studying and partying.
