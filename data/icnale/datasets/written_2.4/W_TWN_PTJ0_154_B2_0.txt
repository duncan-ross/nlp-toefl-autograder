Having a part-time job is important for college students. As a matter of fact, college students should be encouraged to have a part-time job in order to gain working experience and learn from a different environment. In college, the most important job for students is study and work hard to pass or to attain a better academic performance. However, under the circumstances of our education, it is rather hard to obtain certain skills and knowledge only in the campus. For example, most of the college students work as a server, because they can learn to socialize with strangers and practice problem-solving skills given that servers should deal with different kinds of customers every day and manage immediately the problems that might happen at any time. Being a student, we often accept information from professors rather than taking control of the courses. Having a part-time job will help us gain a sense of responsibility. The most common phenomenon for college student is being late for courses. When we have the pressure of a better performance on the job and of being an employer, we will be more mature and knowing what is right to do instead of escaping from responsibilities. As a result, college student should have a part-time job to learn to survive in the society, and by what we learn from the experience, we can perfect our lives and knowledge.
