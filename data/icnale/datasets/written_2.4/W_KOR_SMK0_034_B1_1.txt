I really agree about this topic. Tobacco is really not an absolute point of the beneficial. Tobacco destroys all of things in the world. For example, health, animals, mind, flowers, water, air, etc. Tobacco is only the legitimate drug. The drug is prohibited. It should not be recommended. It should be banned from restaurants and all places. Non-smoking in the restaurants is etiquette. Smokers must unconditionally smoke out of place. Smokers are very annoying. They have no sense of responsibility. Smokers should be considerate non-smokers. Smokers should be ashamed. Smokers in the restaurants should be punished. It is very harmful to smoking people. Its smoke remains a long distance spread in the air. Also its smoke will offend the other person. It will harm other people indirectly. People have a right to drink clean air. Smoking people in the restaurants is selfish. The unpleasant smell of tobacco smoke is banned in the restaurants. The restaurant should be clean. But tobacco is very not clean. It is very dirty. The restaurant is where to eat rice. Harmful smoke, do not people go to restaurant to eat. There are a lot of people at restaurant. Regardless of non-smoke people's will, very harmful tobacco smoke, drinking is very unreasonable. And it is very harmful to children and pregnancy and patient. The government should prohibit smoking in restaurants. Therefore, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
