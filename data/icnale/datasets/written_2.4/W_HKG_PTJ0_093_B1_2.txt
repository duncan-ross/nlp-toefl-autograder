"Receiving a part time job is commonplace and important for university students nowadays" This statement is especially true for those students in Hong Kong. It is a widespread knowledge that students aged between 6-18 are normally granted 12-year free education in Hong Kong. Understandably, university students are excluded from the privilege of free education and most families often find it harsh to shoulder extra financial burden after the short-lived joy of securing a place in university by the children. Even worse, the fee is not only confined to $40, 000 annual lesson fee, but also other expenses in buying astonishingly expensive books and joining numerous socializing activities in campus. Perhaps this phenomenon gives a sound reason for many undergraduates and postgraduates to find a relieve for their harsh financial situation and enrich their life experience in dealing with other people. Furthermore, free time for university students is prerequisite to find out their aim and explore their potential. A part time job would be a good agent for them to learn responsibility, time management and commitment to their own business. All in all, taking a part time job is a wise decision for a university student.
