I do agree this topic because cigarettes can cause cancer such as lung cancer, mouth cancer etc. Smoking cigarettes also effect people surround the smoker. They will breathe it. The worse thing is why the second- hand smoker could have cancer too. In spite they never touch it. The people who often be around the smoker will get cancer without realizing it. So Is this fair? Especially in restaurants, there are many kind of age in restaurants, man, woman, boy, girl, pregnant and the elderly. So only one smoker can make ten people around there get cancer. The obvious effect, the smoker will disturb people in the restaurant for example it's difficult to breathe and eat or the smoke may be make you throw up not only eat food but also eat cancer too. If this policy work, people in the country will be more healthy you will eat without smoke, cancer will get away from you but this policy will not work if restaurant's owner don't help. It depend on everybody include the smoker. The government should release law of smoking. Strict law is also important too. Or the government may found the suitable place for the smoker. And I hope it will possible in the future.
