I agree with this statement. Smoking harms our health. If smokers are harmed their health by smoking, it is their own responsibility. But people who are near smokers are also harmed their health. It is very important thing. Almost all the restaurants in the country have smoking area. When we enter a restaurant, a clerk of the shop says Do you smoke? Of course, our university has smoking area and non smoking. So, some smokers say it's O. K. But, I think smoking area is near non smoking area. It is meaningless. I have an experience. I went to a restaurant with my friend. Of course, we don't smoke. So, we sat down non smoking seat. However, there is smoking seat behind us. And, people sat the seat began to smoke. It is not strange thing. But for non smokers, smoking is very, very bad thing. We couldn't enjoy eating. Therefore, it is important to separate each area. For example, smoking is prohibited all the platforms of station except smoking area. This area is the edge of platform or room. But the restaurants don't have so large place. So it is difficult to make smoking area like station. Therefore, I agree with statement. Probably, some smokers say We have a right to enjoy smoking! But, I want them to think about non smoking people. And, I want to say them to stop smoking only at the table.
