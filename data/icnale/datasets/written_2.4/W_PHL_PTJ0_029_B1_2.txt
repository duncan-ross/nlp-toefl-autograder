Having a job is something that makes us proud because with this we earn something not just financially but also socially and emotionally. There are different kinds of jobs we have the full time and the part time jobs, in the full time job we spend most of our time to that job but in the part time job we just given a limited time so we can still do other things. Many people choose to have a part time job so they can have more time doing other things than working like some mothers do, they look for a part time job so they can still have time for their family especially to their children. Part time job is also common to students who want to have an extra income that can help them financially thru their studies. Students who have part time jobs are very hard working because they can manage their time and energy in their studies and work Part time job is not just a part time job it's also a big responsibility and hard work. Even though it's just a part time people should not underestimate it because a job is still a job no matter how much time you spent on it.
