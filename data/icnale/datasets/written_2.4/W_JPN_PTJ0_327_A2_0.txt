I agree to the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I write reasons for the agreement. First of all, students who have not worked and have only studied can experience that it is difficult to earn money. They who have gotten money from their parents up to now can learn the severity in the society. Second, students can pay their school expenses and transportation to and from school by themselves by having a part-time job. Their parents' expenses for them are lightened. To be sure, their study time decreases by having a part-time job, but they can get precious experiences. For my case, I have worked at the Izakaya of Umeda for a year. At first, I can not do almost nothing. Only one thing I can do is to serve foods and drinks to the guests as said. But now, I can do various things. For example, I can make drinks, teach a junior partner and manage time in the feast. I felt my growing up in one year. In addition, I could make many friends. Now, I can pay all my school expenses by myself. Like this case, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
