 Nowadays, there is an increasing concern of the topic that should smoking be allowed or not in public places. People hold different views about it. As for me, I firmly believe that smoking should be forbidden in public places. I can raise examples to go back to my point of view. First of all, smoking in public will do harm to others' health. As it is known to all, smoking is bad to our health. The smoke may increase the risk of getting cancer. On the other hand, if someone smokes in public place, then it equals that the others are forced to smoke together. Consequently, those who have a good living habit may be ill, and it is unfair to them. What's more, smoking in public places will do harm to our environment. Smoking in public places like parks or gardens will undoubtedly lead to air pollution, while smoking in restaurants may also make the floor dirty. It is everyone's duty to make our environment better, so smoking in public places should not be allowed. In a word, smoking should not be allowed in public places not only for sake of people's health but also for our environment. All of us ought to work together to make our environment better and make ourselves more healthy.
