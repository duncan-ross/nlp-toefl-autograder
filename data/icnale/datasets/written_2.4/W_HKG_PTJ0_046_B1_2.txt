It is very common that most university students would find a part time job during their three years undergraduate university life. Not only can they earn some money, but they also can absorb working experiment. It is to everybody's knowledge that working experiment is very important to us for so many employers are not willing to get use of the graduates who just focu on the theories in the textbook without having any relevant work experience. Working experience, in some sense, can be interpreted as the ability of students applying what they learnt to the real life problems. No one would like to employ a person having a high academic education level but not knowing how to apply what he/she learnt to solve the real life problems. Having a part time job can bring some income for students. Note that the school fee in university is quite costly. Although there is a grant-loan system offered from the school and the government, the daily expenditure is also a load to some students, epecially for those coming from the poor families. There is no doubt that money earned from the part time job is a remedy for them. Personally, I agree that having a part time job within three years university life is a benefit for students.
