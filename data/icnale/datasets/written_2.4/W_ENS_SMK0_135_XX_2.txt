I couldn't agree more. I feel that Japan should issue an immediate smoking ban in all restaurants and also all public places. Contrary to popular opinion on the part of the smoking fraternity, this would in no way violate their civil rights. But rather, it would be protecting the rights of all non-smoking people and the immediate environment as well. Time and time again, we hear of the thousands that die needlessly each year because of smoking related and passive smoking related illnesses or diseases. I think that if adult smokers choose to smoke then of course, that is their prerogative provided that it does not infringe upon the rights and fresh air of non-smokers. I really believe that it is time that Japan played more of a leading role in restricting and regulating smoking areas. Since Japan has a high percentage per capita of heavy smokers, a ban would go a long way towards discouraging smoking in general as well as cleaning up the public space environment so that it is more conducive to the health of all who make use of those spaces. It would seem pointless to spend time and money to reduce harmful pollutants into the air and support global reductions if conversely, Japan was to allow and condone smokers to pollute Japan's own public spaces.
