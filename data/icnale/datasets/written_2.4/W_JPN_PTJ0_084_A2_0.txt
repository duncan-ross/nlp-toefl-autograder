I agree with the statement that college students have a part-time job. Because they are more free than when they were high school students. I think that doing part-time job is the best way for them to change free time into useful time and to make money. College student is a part of a baby of working people. So, they have to learn the manner of society, the rule, communication with many people and so on. Then, they experience working in the society such part-time job and get used to place of this society. And they feel they could learn a piece of them after that. There are many kinds of part-time job. I think that we should do many kinds of part-time job for 4 years in college. We can't necessarily do job which we want to do. Many people in the world is faced with this thing. So, I think that we need do many part-time job to cope with anything easily. Now, I am a college student and don't have money very much. But, I don't have part-time job. So, I want to do part-time job in order to get much money and to become a person who is respected in this society.
