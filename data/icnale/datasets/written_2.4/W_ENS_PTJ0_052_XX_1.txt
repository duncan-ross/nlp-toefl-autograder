Part-time work is just not a viable strategy for many college students. Whether or not they have enough time to devote to something else besides studying is up to them, but they can only make such a little amount of money at a part-time job that sometimes I feel like it is not worth it. Despite this, I myself have been forced to take part-time jobs several times throughout my college career, and it is my hope that by graduating I will no longer have to pursue these menial tasks in order to make enough money to eat and live and have a roof over my head. Therefore the most important thing is for students to focus on their studies and graduate on time, not like me who dropped out of school and began to work without a college degree. A bad choice like this can really come back to bite you, so it is worth taking the time to do things right the first time. To avoid a mistake like this, I think that the best strategy would be to simply avoid part-time work if you can then ask your parents for financial help or take advantage of the financial aid program that your school offers so that you can spend as much time as possible on your schoolwork.
