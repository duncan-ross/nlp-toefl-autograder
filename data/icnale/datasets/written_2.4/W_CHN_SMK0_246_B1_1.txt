I strongly agree that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in China. Although it is hard to make it reality, I still hope that one day there is no more awful smoke in restaurants. Now, let us talk about it objectively. Firstly, Smoking can cause a lot of illness including heart attack and lung cancer which is almost deadly for human being. As we all know, restaurants are public places which is crowded with people. If someone smokes in a restaurant, people around him will be affected by the harmful gas. In my opinion, smoking is not to blame. But for non-smokers, it is obviously unfair to be forced to breath other's smoke. On the other hand, if smoking is completely banned in restaurants, I believe not only the air condition but the environment of the restaurants will be greatly improved. There is no doubt that our mood will be better when we are in a smoking-banned restaurant. So it is also a good news for restaurants because more customers will choose it, especially non-smokers. However, the smokers may not support this policy because they need to smoke. In that case, I think we can build some smoking-rooms in restaurants for them. In this way, we can satisfy both smokers and non-smokers. Hopefully there is less smoke in public places in the future.
