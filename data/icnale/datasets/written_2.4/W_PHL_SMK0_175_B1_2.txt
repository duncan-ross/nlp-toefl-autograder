WARNING: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health. I hate this statement that advertisers had been included in their advertisements. It is so foolish of them to sell these kinds of products and yet in the end of their advertisement, they affirm this piece of fact. Well, at least they gave a warning. But still, I am not in favor of this mere action. I agree with the decision that smoking should be banned in all of the restaurants in the Philippines. I am simply stating that I strongly agree. There are two main reasons why non-smokers hate it when they're with smokers: first of all, non-smokers hate that smell --- that smell which makes them expel air from our lungs by coughing; and second, they are aware with the fact that the ones who smell the smoke are more prone to having respiratory or lung diseases compared to the ones who are actually smoking cigarettes. I insist that it is really unfair to allow people to smoke inside the restaurants. There are a lot of disadvantages in this situation with regards to the health of the people. Add to that, it can be a distraction for people who are dealing with their own matters. I think that smokers can smoke in some other places and rather than in restaurants. Lastly, instead of smoking in the restaurant, they should be eating and spending time with their friends or family --- the reason why in the first place, they came in such place.
