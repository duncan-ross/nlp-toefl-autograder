From my side, I think smoking should be banned at all restaurant. Although smoking has now reduced from many years ago but this shouldn't overlook. Because restaurant is the public place you have to respect the others. If you would like to smoke, it's better for you to smoke in the place that provided for smoker only. I think it has many way to say to smoker to discard smoking or reduce smoking such as teaching about disadvantages of smoking, effect of smoking to everyone. They may realize that smoking is bad. Or you can do some campaign in school, university, official place or in the crowded places by make some handbill for distribution or make some exhibition. Media is one of many thing that cause people smoking for example in television, movie, NEWS. Government have to establish some agency to inquire the media before send it to citizen and set the law about people who smoking or protect others from smoker. Finally, smoking is harmful for your health and people around you. In some restaurant that have outdoor area, it's not annoy the other too much but in restaurant with air condition it's not good if you smoke inside their. But the best way is not smoke at all.
