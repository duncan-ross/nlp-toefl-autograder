Most people say that being a college student should have a chance to try a part-time job. But I think we shouldn't put much time on this kind of thing. As a student, despite of a college student, we still concentrate on our study. Being a college student means we have to have a lot of courses to study and have plenty of books to read. We also have to finish many tasks which teachers tell us to do. So we may be have little time and energy to think about the part-time job. We should do take some social activities at the right time, which definitely doesn't say we must take those things. As we know, should and must really have different means. If we don't distinguish the position between study and social works, we may be confused about our intention of going to the college. Besides, social activities don't completely equal with part-time jobs. We should make them clear. Social works are ok, but part-time jobs are a waste of time. I know a friend of mine, who ever tried a part-time job. He said that although it sounded perfect, it was very hard to make the two into the balance. During his work, he sometimes worked longer than he imaged. Most of his tasks were tough and boring, but he had to do that. He lost a lot of time to study his work, and didn't finish his homework perfectly. As a result, his final exam was not finished as good as it used to be. He said he learned a lot through this thing. We should keep this: To study well is our duty when we are students whatever the situation is.
