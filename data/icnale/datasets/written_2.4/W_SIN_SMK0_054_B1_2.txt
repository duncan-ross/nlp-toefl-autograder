Yes, I agree. Smoking has been proven to be detrimental to health. It potentially causes lung cancer, as well as more immediate and visible symptoms such as yellowing of one's teeth. Furthermore, second-hand smoking is worse for health --- these people are not used to the smoke, and this has been proven to be worse for their bodies. Singapore has taken many measures to limit smoking --- for one, they mark up the prices of cigarettes, such that it is very costly to maintain the habit of smoking, in an effort to deter people from smoking. For two, they print gory graphics on the cigarettes' boxes, to warn smokers of the harmful effects of smoking. For three, they have increased the ban of smoking in most places, limiting it to only open-area carparks, amongst other places. I feel that other countries should follow Singapore's lead, because this would be overall beneficial to the population. Firstly, the individuals are at lesser risk of the health side effects of smoking. Secondly, this would gradually lead to cleaner air --- smokers do not have to add to the already polluted air, caused by motor emissions. Thirdly, there would be less litter, because there would be less cigarette butts casually disposed off, by inconsiderate smokers.
