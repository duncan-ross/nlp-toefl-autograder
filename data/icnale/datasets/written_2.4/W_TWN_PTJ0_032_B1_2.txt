I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, although it takes time to have a part-time job, you can learn different experience that you can not learn from class. For example, you can learn how to associate with colleague who is older or younger than you. Because being a student for over ten years we always get along to someone who has same age as you when we get into the society we have to work with many people who have very different life experience or age. If you have a part-time job when college you can get along with colleague better. Second, you will know that it is hard to earn money and you will use your money well. Being a college student you have much more free time than being a junior or senior high school student. In other words, you will have a lot of time to hang out with your friend, it takes money. If you have a part-time job, you will have additional money to hang out with your friends and you will feel less sorry for spend money which parents give you. Last of all, you will learn some professional knowledge from your work. Take me for example I have a part-time job in our department office for about one and half years. During these time, I have learned how to send governmental, how to operate machines in our office and many rule of our school. Although it is tired to have a part-time job, I learn many things from working. Therefore I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
