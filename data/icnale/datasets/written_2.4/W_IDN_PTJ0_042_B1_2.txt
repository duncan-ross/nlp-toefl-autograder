I am in the favour that college students should have a part time job. For me, there are three advantages that students can take for being part timer. First of all, students are drilled to be able to manage their time as well. Indeed, part time do not take a whole time that students have. Yet, still students have to manage their leisure time or time that is not lecture time. Usually, students use their leisure time to do the assignments or going fun for spending weekend. By being part timer, they have to manage their time as well they have time for doing part time job, but still there are times for doing assignments. Secondly, students have experiences in workplace. How to do good things for the employee, how to mingle wtth the people around, how to solve the problem dealing wit the workplace and so on. Absolutely, they will be more get ready to face the 'real giant', that is the real job that will be had in the future. Short, these students are head and shoulders about the rest. The last but not least, students can be independent; do not rely on their parents in terms of financial matter. For knowledge, Indonesian do not accustomed that adolesence or people at the age of 18 and above live separetely with their parents; here 'live' not just point out to live together with their parents but also about their living cost. Parents still have the responsibility of their child's living untill they get married. Thus, they are be able to pay their living by their own salary or money. That's why, taking part time job actually not should to do so but it is essential to do.
