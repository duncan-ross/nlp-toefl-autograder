Let's suppose you are in a luxurious restaurant with your beautiful girl friend. Hearing a romantic music, you are enjoying a tender beef stake. Suddenly, a man, who is sitting the next table to you, fires his cigarette and blows toward your side. If you were in this situation, what would your feeling like? Everyone might be angry to be a victim of this situation. To make matters worse, when it comes to the health problem, whoever is in this restaurant obviously get angry. It is not a new story that the indirect smoking is much more harmful for health comparing to the direct smoking. Even though most people are aware of this famous scientific fact, smoking is not banned completely at all restaurants in the country. Smokers have no rights to bring damages to the Non-smokers. They have to be made recognize the fact that they are like murderer. Some people might say that we should also protect the right of smoke. However, I'd like to point out that many people are suffering from the second hand smoking and astronomical cost is taken cleaning the butts and building additional smoking sections. We cannot allow these unnecessary social costs to be expanded anymore. The policy makers should ban smoking at all restaurants in this country.
