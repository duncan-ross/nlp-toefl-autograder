I personally agree and find it distasteful to tolerate smoke when I am dining out and I am also fully conversant with the medical implications of all forms of smoking and all of the pros and cons. However on the surface, it would appear to be detrimental financially. The figures don't lie and there is bound to be some initial financial impact. Japan may appear to be better off by continuing to allow smoking in restaurants however, as I will point out later, this is not in fact the case at all. With Japan being one of the world's leading smoking nations, a ban would most definitely impact the economy and also restaurant profits. While studies have shown that initially, numbers increased when bans were introduced, over a longer period of time, there was an overall decrease in net profit right across the board. Be that as it may though and personal opinions and tastes aside, if Japan were to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the economy, they would discover that with the rising costs of health care and insurance, the cost of not banning smoking in both human value and financial value, would be far greater than not banning smoking.
