I do not think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I understand that many students have financial difficulty and are therefore forced to work in order to make ends meet, but I really think that most of us in college or steel cans and we should not have to provide for ourselves quite yet. If we're lucky, our parents are very responsible and have already saved up a lot of money so that we can go to college and focus on school rather than making money ourselves. Actually, I had a part-time job in high school, but in that time, I had a lot more free time and I didn't take school as seriously. Everything is different in college though. Now we're studying to become lawyers or doctors or engineers or psychologists were artists or anything else, and we are studying so that we can spend the rest of our careers working in these areas. It is important to spend as much time gaining as much knowledge as we can in our own fields so that we can be successful when we have to enter the real world and start working at companies. So no, I don't think college student should have a part-time job, and I think that it will be a while before I start working.
