Being and ex-smoker, I agree. I am not agreeing just because I have stopped smoking though. I am agreeing because I think that even if I was still smoking, it is not fair to others that they should have to suffer for my bad habits. There are the kids to think of as well as people who may have some sort of illness like asthma or bronchitis which we don't always know about because we don't know them personally. I reckon that if I want to smoke, then that is my business, but it is everybody's business if I start puffing smoke at them or in their air space. That to me is just being arrogant and rude and displays a total disregard for others. I would support restaurant bans in Japan or any country in return for a place where smokers could go to smoke without endangering others. I think that most smokers who have any sense of fairness, would agree with me on this. It is never too late to show consideration for others but it's a bit late to say you are sorry if someone dies because they have been breathing in your second-hand smoke. Then it would be like shutting the gate after you have already let the horse out.
