Everybody knows that smoking is bad to our health, but there are still a lot of people smoking. Smoking does our lung harm. Seriously, it may cause lung cancer. Except for hurting smoking people, it still hurts those who don't smoke but breathe too much smoke into their lung. If a mother-to-be smokes, she may hurt her baby's health. So, to avoid hurting our health, smoking people should try to quit it. Now there is a kind of candy which is made of the same ingredient, but it includes little of it. When you want to smoke, you just have it so that you still can have the same sense of satisfaction without smoking. Besides, you can try to reduce the times of smoking. Everyday you decrease the times of smoking so that you would quit it slowly. Take my father for example. He smokes for more than twenty years. However, he still quits it successfully. To many people, quitting smoking is difficult for them. But, if you determined to do, actually it is not as difficult as you imagine. Do you smoke? If your answer is "yes", then quit it now! Giving up smoking is not only for your health, but also for others. Just be determined, and I believe you would succeed in it.
