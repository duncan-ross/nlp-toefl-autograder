Smoking has been a controversial issue for a long time since it not only does harm to people's health, but also cause pollution, crimes and other serious problems. At the mention of whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, there has never been an agreement among people. Some people firmly support the ban considering the disadvantages of smoking while others think that smoking can be allowed in the restaurants under some specific circumstances as long as the policy is purposely carried out. Personally speaking, I hold the view that smoking shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, there are a great number of people dining out in restaurants everyday. Most of them have the habit of smoking or need to smoke while having business talk with their clients in the restaurants. If they are banned from smoking in these situations, their business will be affected and they will feel so unsatisfied that they may no longer eat in some restaurants which can lead to a lot of bankruptcy and unemployment. Secondly, since people aren't allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they may find other public places to smoke. Even if bans are carried out at all the restaurants, they may still smoke in any public places such as parks, buses, stores and so on. This vicious circle will do an even greater harm to our environment. Last but not least, a complete ban from smoking at all the restaurants is financially unrealistic. The revenue of selling cigarettes greatly contributes to a country's economy every year. In summary, smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country for several social and financial reasons. But that doesn't mean the complete permission is feasible. I think we should establish some specific areas at the restaurants for people to smoke. That will not only relieve the problem of pollution to some extent, but also promote the economic growth of our country.
