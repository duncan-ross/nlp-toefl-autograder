College student are very busy in studies they have no time for extra activities. If they are weak in studies then they should be work hard and for hardworking time is required. So, if they have part time job then they have less time for study and it is not possible k wo part time job b krein aur waqat niakal kar perhein bhi. It is too much difficult task for them. Some people are poor and do not afford they study of their child and their child want to study these student have no other chance. Some of the students want to depand on your sey so in this way they do not depend on their parents and get money from part time job. I think it is very much difficult for students so part time job destroy their future. Because they have double minded in this way. Their concentration on study is less. So, they fail to get knowledge and fail to get good marks. If student is brilliant and their study is not affected by part time job, and they think that they cover syllabus well and it is good thing for students to achieve or get some extra thing, you participated in race of life.
