Going through college is an integral part of life. It is part of the process one goes through in acquiring knowledge and experience in order to face life's circumstances. In living the college life, students are gradually trained to become actual citizens of the country wherein they practice their chosen profession. However, is it important for college students to have part-time jobs as part of their training? I don't think so. Although part-time jobs may indeed serve as a training ground for students before they become real professionals or workers, I believe that it is not necessary at all for students to be involved with these jobs while studying. Working in these jobs may only divert the student's time and attention away from their studies, especially for the freshmen. Fresh from the high school system, first year college students are still in the process of adjusting their time management. Aside from that, working while studying will be especially hard for those students studying in a trimestral system. I also believe that the opportune time will come when students are given the chance to practice their learned concepts at school. The opportune time that I am talking about is the on-the-job training program that students will undergo on their higher years during college. Even though I don't consider part-time jobs as a significant part of college life, I am not against it. If the students can handle their time and can benefit from these jobs such as earning additional income, they may work in part-time jobs.
