Cigarette is one of the largest income of Indonesia. Cigarettes can give millions of employment opportunities, so can reduce unemployment. However, smoking has a bad impact. Smoking can cause health problems, heart attack, pneumonia, until death. The impact is also felt by smokers who inhale smoke passively. That is why the restaurant should not allow their customer to smoke. Visitors who smoke in the room can disturb the comfort of other customers. Besides that, the other customers will receive the bad impact of cigarette smoke. Although the effects may not be felt now, these effects are real and many people had experienced it. A good restaurant should be able to ensure the customer's comfort and health. Restaurants can stick to a ban sign for smoking at some point in the room. In addition, the waiters can be warned with polite for visitors to not smoke in the room. Many restaurants are already doing that as a standard of quality in the restaurant. Some of them also provide a special room for customers who smoke. The room is usually an open space, or room with cigarette smoke suction device so that the smoker is also convenient. By providing these rooms, restaurants can ensure the convenience of both parties, visitors who smoke and other visitors.
