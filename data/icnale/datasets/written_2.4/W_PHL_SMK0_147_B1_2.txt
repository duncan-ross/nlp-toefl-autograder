I have been exposed to smoking ever since I was a child. People who smoke are everywhere, at home, outside, in malls and restaurants. I have always been part of the scene wherein smokers are in here and in there. Restaurants who won't ban smoking should at least have smoking areas away from air conditioned rooms. The banning of smoking in all restaurants in the country should at least be banned if restaurants can't accommodate to have smoking areas for smokers. They should also be strict in their no smoking policies. I say this because one smoker can change the lives of many around them. He may influence another, or may cause lung cancer to those who happen to inhale dangerous second hand smoke. Smoking should at least be banned in restaurants all over the country, maybe also in malls and others alike. Smoking really is dangerous not only for the person smoking, but also for the people around him. Smoke exhaled can really be dangerous and can cause a lot of problems to others and for the world. Imagine people smoking everywhere, polluting the air around us together with chlorofluorocarbon, carbon and sulphur oxides, carbon dioxides and monoxides, and other radioactive pollutants that come from us. The use of factories and air conditioners everyday should be enough for the world to handle, and resist global warming. But imagine the world population smoking, I think that's just too much. In my opinion, if smoking can be banned in restaurants all over the country, why not make it apply to the whole country as well? I therefore conclude that the banning of smoking is extremely important to help our planet to live for our sake too.
