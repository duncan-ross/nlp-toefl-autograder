Although smoking is an unhealthy living habit and many people see it as a social cancer which threats both the smokers themselves and other people's health, banning smoking in all the restaurants is quite unnecessary and irrational. On one hand, if this practice targets at encouraging more and more smokers to quit smoking, that would be too strict. Quit smoking is a long and bitter process, it's impossible for those smokers to make it overnight, banning smoking in restaurants makes their life not convenient and may hurt their feelings because I think restaurants should be a place to relax, where many people ease their pressure by enjoying smoking. On the other hand, if restaurants aim at protecting other costumers' health, complete banning on smoking is not necessary at all. Like the minority of restaurants in the world, we can separate smokers from ordinary costumers and place them in an independent kitchen. To conclude, although smoking is not welcomed in public places, we can make it too strict. However, we can set some rules to limit them, but not totally ban smoking.
