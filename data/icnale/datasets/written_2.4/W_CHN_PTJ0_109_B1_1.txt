Currently, it's a common phenomenon that a great many college students are engaged in seeking for a part- time job. In my point of view, owning a job will undoubtedly make a difference to us students studying at a university. To begin with, the job can be an economic resource so that we can save a great deal of money for our family. On one hand, we can relieve the burden of our parents to some extent. They don't need to devote all the energy to making money and they can set aside some time to do what really appeal to them. On the other hand, the limited but sufficient amount of money will mainly constitute our daily expense. Not only does a part-time job benefit us in college life, but it may also be a valuable wealth when we step into real society. Because this experience where we can clearly recognize the difficulty of earning money will definitely contribute to boosting our independence and ability of communication with strangers. Never let the idea wander in your mind that doing a part-time job is just a waste of time we should have spent on study. If you think like that, you're completely wrong. As a matter of fact, the capability of coping with social problems is equally as important as the certificate on study when you apply for an employment.
