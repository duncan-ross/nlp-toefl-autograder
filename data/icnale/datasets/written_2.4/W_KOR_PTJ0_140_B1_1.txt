I disagree. The student assimilates knowledge rapidly. so It is imperative that students should put their hearts and soul into their studies Also, they need self-improvement. I disagree on college students to have a part - time job. A proper way is pay one's registration fee in installments or school expenses, educational expenses, tuition. So I think that most of students study hard more than have part time job. As mentioned above student is to recognize the talent and individuality of each student and to develop him finally it behooves students to study. Many University Students do part-time-job. They are juggling part-time jobs and hours of homework every night; sometimes they're so exhausted that they're nearly asleep in early-morning classes. Recently Part-time jobs, homework, school activities and friends often are prioritized higher than is sleep. Many Students working part-time to pay for his school expenses. Currently, the major issue among college students is tuition. Some students began protesting against tuition fee rise by refusing to attend classes in other University. Tuition has raised a lot. College tuitions hovered between 5 and percent. So we have to a part-time-job for student fees. Korea's University is going mad I think. Student's fee is very Expensive Just I think.
