I have never had a part-time job in my life, but I have had a full-time job after I completed my A level examinations last year. My full-time job was in a private hospital in Singapore, and I had to assist the doctor and register patients coming into the clinic. I was based in the Women's Centre, and it as definitely an eye-opening experience, especially when I was allowed to shadow the doctors in their consultation rooms. What fascinated me most were the pregnant ladies who came for their regular consultations with their gynaecologists. These women and their husbands seemed so happy looking at their unborn children using the ultrasound apparatus. Unknowingly, I felt happy for them too. However, the doctors had to be the bearer of bad news sometimes, such as telling the mothers that they had miscarried. This broke my heart, and my heart went out to the women who had to undergo such mental trauma. I saw many of them breaking down immediately, while there were others who tried to remain strong despite the pain they were feeling. Some of the doctors were very good at comforting their patients, while others were remained ignorant of their patients' feelings. Seeing such scenes almost on a daily basis inspired me even more to become a doctor. Since I was young, I have always wanted to be a paediatrician, but this full-time job over 6 months has got me thinking about going into the O&G line, and be able to share the joys of giving birth with the new mothers.
