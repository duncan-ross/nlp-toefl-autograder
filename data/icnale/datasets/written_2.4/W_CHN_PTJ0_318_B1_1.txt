I think that for college students, part time job does play a important role in college life. And this can be concluded from three parts. The first one is experience. University is quite different from high school. I think the two main points are studying freely and being closer to society. In this reason, we need find more ways to approach to the society. Part time job can just take on this task. We can see that when we take part time job, no matter you wash dishes or do as a tutor, you are working like a society member in fact. You work in other workers'way, get paid like other workers. From the beginning to the end, you can receive the experience of worker different from the life you get used in school. If you have the work experience before you graduate, you can overcome the work barrier easily comparing to those who don't. Ability is another award from part time job. There is no doubt that we almost lose the ability to make conversation with others effectively since we just focus on study in high school. As a result, we should exercise this ability as soon as possible. Part time job can also provide this chance for you to improve your skill to talk with others. For instance, you can not avoid talking with your boss, your partner and you consumer. In this case, you can exercise talking ability without difficult. Last but not least, part time job is fun. You can image the huge happiness you will get when you are get paid the first time. No matter what you do, from the library assistant to dormitory protector, you will make a lot of true friends because of working together. I think it is really fun when you make one and one new friend and fight with them. It may be hard, but the happiness is bigger, isn't it?
