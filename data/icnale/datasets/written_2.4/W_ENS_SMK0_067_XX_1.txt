Smoking should definitely be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Many of the United States have banned smoking some years ago, and I think that there are probably a few other countries in the world that have already done so as well. This seems like an obvious thing to do because it is simply not acceptable to allow smokers in restaurants to harm other people. When it comes down to it, at the end of the day that's really all that smoking is. It is just hurting yourself, and it is just hurting other people. There are many other ways to gain whatever benefits smokers feel they have such as relaxation or exercise which can induce a similar pleasant state of mind. Also, smoking is detrimental to all the things in the restaurants. The actual building itself can be harmed by the cigarette smoke; for example, the white walls will begin to turn yellow after some time. The fact that this happens to me is quite revolting, and I would assume that other people probably feel the same way, so it would make sense to ban smoking at restaurants because it will make them cleaner and longer lived. This will save money in construction costs and many other ways, so actually, banning smoking at restaurants would be a profitable move.
