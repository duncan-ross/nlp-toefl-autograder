 Nowadays, it is a common phenomenon for college students to have part time jobs when they are getting education in the university. Views may vary from person to person as it has pros and cons and people may lay different emphasis on various aspects. From my perspective, I highly recommend it for it has the following advantages. First and foremost, college students have grown into an adult who must shoulder the responsibility and face the challenges in their occupations in the future. To some extent, part time jobs offer the best opportunity to learn the rules of the society and strengthen their mind when facing all sorts of setbacks what they have never confronted in their study. Moreover, they can taste the hardship of making money and then treasure every penny they get. Last but not least, their university life is enriched by the combination of study and work. Therefore, they will try every mean to keep the balance of them and make every minutes count. An outstanding student can perfectly master their time and study effectively while doing part time jobs. All in all, doing part time jobs is a step to the success of student's further career. Otherwise, because of the lack of experience and preparations of mind, one can hardly go down the path without fear.
