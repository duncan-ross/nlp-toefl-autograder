 I support that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because it does harm to all the people. The reasons lie in several aspects. Smoking in the restaurant is very impolite because the restaurant is a public occasion; many people are eating there every day. If you smoke, it will have bad effects on others. People will hate you and think of you as enemy. To leave a good impression on others, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is harmful to others. Besides, it is also affect your health because smoking can result in many diseases, such as cancer. When my grandpa was young, he smoked very heavily. Gradually, his health was threatened. This year he died because of lung cancer. The effects of smoking on others are more terrible. To protect all people's health, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant will impact the quality of air. If you smoke, the restaurant will be very dirty and nobody is willing to come. The restaurant will lose much money. Worse still, you will feel very uncomfortable. In a word, smoking in the restaurant should be banned. It is high time that we took actions.
