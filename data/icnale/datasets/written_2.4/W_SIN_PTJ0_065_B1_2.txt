A part time job is great for students still studying in high schools or even college, as this reduces their dependence on their parents as well as achieving financial independence. This also has the benefit of reducing the financial burden of the parents, or even help supplement the family income. By working part time, students can also feel financial freedom, and even learn how to budget early on in life. However, some people may recklessly spend their new found income, and continue to do so in increasing amounts later on in life. This may lead to debt when the person starts overspending or taking on credit loans. Besides earning extra income, a part time job is also useful to gain working experience. This will allow the student gain an upper hand when looking for a full time, permanent job. Another positive side effect of working part time could be the new social connections one could make whilst working. By networking this early in life, many opportunities could arise for the part timer, and sometimes even go on to open up a career path for him or her. However, there are also downsides to working part time. Working part time greatly decreases the amount of spare time one could have for relaxation and play. If overworked, one could neglect their other important parts of their lives like bonding with their friends and family. Over time, this could lead to the person not having a fulfilling, balanced life, causing depression in severe cases. All in all, I still believe that every student should get part time jobs, so as to broaden their horizons and also to make extra cash for future needs or even for indulgence. However, one should also not neglect their social life while working.
