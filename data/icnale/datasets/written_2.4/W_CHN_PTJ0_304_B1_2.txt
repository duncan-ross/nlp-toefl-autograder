 Nowadays, an increasing number of college students take their part-time jobs in their spare time. It is generally acknowledged that there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs. It offers them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school. In addition, it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Besides, part-time experiences may have great help to their future careers. Moreover, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of society. Judging from the evidence offered, we might safely draw the conclusion that taking a part-time job brings about several benefits to college students. But what is worth noting is that the college students cannot put too much time and energy in doing part-time jobs but neglect their study. For one thing, the main job of college students is to study, not to work. If they have part-time jobs, they may have to reduce their time for sleep, rest, study and activities. Working several hours a day consumes a lot of time and energy and may affect their studies. As a result, they may find it hard to adjust to what the college expects of them as well as their employers expect, finally they may fall behind or fail in their studies. For another, students may be cheated or hurt by their employers, because they lack of enough experience. Weighing the advantages and disadvantages, I think that college students should step out of campus and take some part-time jobs. Undoubtedly, it opens them a window to know the society. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and their study. To conclude, if the schedule permits, doing part-time jobs in spare time is a good choice for college students.
