As everybody knows, smoking is a bad habit that doesn't have any advantages. Smoking may conduct heart-disease or lung cancer or some other disease. But why there are still some people like smoking? Smoking is a habit; it is not easy to give up it. There comes a topic that should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My answer is I don't think so. Of course smoking is bad, but we should take the people who like smoking into consideration. It is unfair for them can't smoke at all the restaurant if cigarettes are still sold. But should smoking be allowed at all the restaurant? The answer must be no for it is unfair for the people who don't smoke. Then what should we do? In my opinion, all the restaurants should be departed into two parts---smoking area and non-smoking area. It can not only fulfillment the people who smoke but also not bother the other people who don't smoke. So I think it is a wonderful idea. Of course, I wish all the people like smoking can give up smoking some day and all the cigarettes will disappear in the future. On that day, the question we are talking about will not exist any more.
