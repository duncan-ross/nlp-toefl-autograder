Smoking in public space should be ban! I was a smoker. I know smoking in the restaurant. But I never see that burn cigar in the restaurant or public place. If really they do in restaurant that was very rude behavior. I never burn cigar in public space or restaurant. It was social knowledge. I taught like this. I want to ban burning cigar in the restaurant. When burn cigar, cigar makes many things. For example, not good smell and many biochemistry essentials. That make lung cancel or skin trouble. None smoker smelled smoke, so I think that smoking must ban in the restaurant or public space. In this way, public space or restaurant many children come to eat or enjoy their time with their parents. Smoke is violence to young children. Maybe some trouble grows up and makes skin trouble. For instance atopic trouble. What a terrible situation or disease. As you can see like this situation, Smoking smell or ash is very harmful especially to young children or people. I want to hope to smoker please do not use cigar in the public space or restaurant. When you burn your cigar, you make harmful biochemistry essential or violence disease. Please remember that fact.
