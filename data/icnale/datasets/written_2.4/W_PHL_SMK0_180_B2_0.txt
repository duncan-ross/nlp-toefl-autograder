I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Some points that the only reason that this topic is being tackled is due to the health problems that smoking causes to the non-smokers but it will be unfair to the smokers if this rule happens. First off, most if not all restaurants in the country have portions in their restaurants designated as for smokers, hence giving a place for these smokers to smoke and not affect the non-smokers. Once this rule is applied to the country, there might be an economic disaster waiting to happen because cigarette is one big portion of the country's economy. In Metro Manila alone, I believe there are two cigarette factories and if this rule happens, it will ruin the lives of the workers in these factories hence bringing less investment in our country. It will create a disastrous effect in the economy of the country because just this year, the MMDA has imposed a no smoking rule to public places. It has shut down a lot of smoking spots that lessened the buying rate of cigarettes to its consumers. Adding this other rule would drastically change the minds of its consumers and makers that it might force the makers to pull back its investments here in our country, greatly damaging the economy of the country. It won't guarantee the success of the project to lessen air pollution because it is not the cigarettes that really pollute the air but the gas from cars and factories. We may all now that cigarettes do damage the lungs especially the second hand smokers but taking out smoking in restaurants doesn't guarantee that these smokers will stop. Hence I disagree that smoking should be completely banned to all restaurants in the country.
