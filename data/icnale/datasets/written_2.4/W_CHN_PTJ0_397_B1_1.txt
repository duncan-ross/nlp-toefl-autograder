From my point of view, it's essential for us college students to have part-time jobs. As is shown in some surveys, the percentage of university students doing part-time jobs cam be as high as 70 percent in some schools located in the prosperous district, especially those around the CBD. Alleged to a new survey I have recently read, many students have the desire to do part-time jobs from the bottom of heart. As above, we can see part-time job is fairly important, just as the meaning of water to fishes. Why are part-time jobs so popular in some way? There are some reasons probably explaining the puzzle. Among college students, nearly all are adults. Deep in their heart is a sense of independence, which means to support themselves as possible as they can. This is the most crucial fountain of the motive for us university students to have part-time jobs. Furthermore, it's part-time jobs that improve our comprehensive abilities and add to our social experience. Meanwhile, through social practice just like part-time jobs, not only can we make some extra money to support our daily life and lighten parental load, but widen out horizons and strengthen our relationship webs, which are very precious sources and will assuredly help us someday somewhere. What's more, part-time jobs covering some of our leisure time, we can shorten our time spent on boring things such as popular games, soap operas or chats. Part-time jobs make our life full in some degree. All in all, as college students, as adults, it's time that we went into the real society and did something. Part-time job can serve as a media or bridge for us, so why not seize the time and opportunity. Remember, time is flying, so is opportunity. Seize your time to have a try and you may be astounded.
