I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons. It takes a long time for us to realize the importance of having a part-time job for college students. In fact, having a part-time job has a lot of advantages. First of all, finding a part-time job is a good way to improve students' practical abilities. Take a friend of mine for example, he took a part-time job as a food deliver during the summer vacation time. He told me that he had been more patient after he took that job and he thought that he has improved his skills in society. In addition, finding a part-time job can make your life diverse. You will feel a sense of alive and you will find that life is more interesting. But today's students don't like part-time job. They think it is a kind of waste of time. What's more, some of students say that they can't near the cruelty of society. In fact, disadvantages exist. But all in all, having a part-time job is a kind of practice for college students. It can be training before we enter the real society and it can help us improving our skills.
