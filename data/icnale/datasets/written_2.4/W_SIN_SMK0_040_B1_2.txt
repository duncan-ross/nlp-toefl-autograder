Yes, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. To frequent smokers or addicts, they could see this as an unreasonable demand given all the other restrictions that have already been placed on them. However, to ban smoking at all restaurants would bring greater benefits to the community and society as a whole and hence, it should be implemented. Smoking has negative effects on one's health as well as those who breathe in their second-hand smoke. Statistics have shown that smoking is one of the main reasons for the high level of lung cancer. However, rather than for personal health, banning smoking from all restaurants would be for the benefit of the majority who would have to breathe in second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke has been shown to be more harmful than smoking itself. As such, banning smoking at all restaurants would actually bring about more health benefits to the society as a whole and also bring down the possibility of people getting lung cancer. In addition, it is necessary that smoking be banned in restaurants, especially those that are often patronised by families. It is to set a good example to young children and teenagers that smoking should not be allowed. It is an unhealthy act that not only harms one's health but also the environment that we live in. Last, it reduces the risk of having a fire. If the cigarette is not put out, it could actually leave behind a risk for a possible fire to start as a restaurant would have all the gas cylinders as well as furniture that could catch fire easily.
