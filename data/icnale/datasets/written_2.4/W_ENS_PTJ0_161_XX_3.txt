I agree and think that it would do college students a tremendous amount of good if they did, even though they might not truly want to work. They need to get work experience anyway which in turn makes them more employable and they also get a new range of practical skill sets that they can adapt to their college tasks and put them to use immediately. When I was in college and working, my organizational and creative skills improved dramatically after only a few weeks working and I was easily able to transfer these to my college work and I still use those same skills today. I am also a little old fashioned in that I believe we have to earn things in life without relying on charity or people just giving us what we want. We have more respect for ourselves, more confidence and in my case I become far more self-reliant than I have ever was previously. I was better prepared to enter the workplace and knew that I could make a difference and provide real service to my company. Sometimes we become more successful by doing the things that others won't do and I learned that in my first part-time job.
