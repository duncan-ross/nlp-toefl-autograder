Smoking must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's not should be banned, it must be completely banned. As you know, there are so many smokers live in our world. And also there are few non-smokers live here. But you see, there is no place for non-smokers. Smokers always smoke almost everywhere, they smoke in bus stop, terminal, toilet, school. . . It's difficult to find non-smoking place. Why always minority has to endure by majority? It's not fair. You know, we always heard about that secondhand smoke is not good. But if smokers smoke inside, it's worse than smoke outside. Especially, in restaurant? Uh-oh, never. There are pregnant women in restaurant. It's the worst thing to fetus. I know, I maybe a little extremist but it am about ethic problem. Well, maybe it's just the matter about one cigarette, however; more think about it. What about if your child is deformity, and you are not a smoker and your spouse also, and it's not your fault? Who could recompense this matter? No one. Your fault is just eaten with your spouse or alone in the restaurant which is allowed smoking. So, what do you think? I think that's why I insist smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.
