 In the context of Singapore, smoking is still considered a taboo because of the negative side effects it brings --- health problems and second-hand smoke. Non-smokers typically resent the presence of unpleasant smell of smoke possibly containing carcinogens. Smoking in enclosed areas such as restaurants destroys the ambience of the restaurant and dining becomes a chore. In order to not exclude smokers, some restaurants have allocated designated open-air corners so that smokers can still smoke and dine at the restaurant without polluting the air within the air-conditioned place. Bearing this concept in mind, smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. However, we must note that the concept of having a non-smoking area is only possible if there is space for one. Smoking in enclosed restaurants will probably deter the non-smoking majority from dining there. Therefore, smoking should be banned for restaurants without smoking corners. On the other hand, smoking can be completely banned at all restaurants as a scheme the government can consider in order to reducing the number of smokers in the country. With reduced areas for smoking, smokers will find it more constrained and difficult to smoke as and when they like. In a totally utopian point of view, perhaps completely banning smoking at all restaurants could mark the start of a smoke-free country. (220 words)
