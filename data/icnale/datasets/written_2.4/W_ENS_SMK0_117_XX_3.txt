I agree very strongly with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The recent trend worldwide is for smoking in public places to be banned - and there are good reasons for this. Chief among these is that through second-hand smoke, smoking is dangerous for everyone - not just smokers. This is especially a concern for restaurant workers. It is unfair to expect people to have to work in this kind of environment, but without a ban, restaurant employers will continue to demand their employees work in smoke-filled restaurants and employees will have no choice but to accept or face losing their jobs. Smoking in restaurants is not just bad for restaurant employees, it is also a massive inconvenience for non-smoking patrons of the restaurant too. Whether there is a smoking area or not makes little to no difference, because smoke travels. People go to restaurants expecting to enjoy good food, but instead find their enjoyment is spoiled because they can only smell smoke - not the food. Of course, at first, restaurant owners would be likely to oppose a ban. Just like in other countries where a ban has been brought in, it can be expected that they will argue that their sales will suffer. But, like in other countries, they would soon see the benefits of a smoke-free environment. Their employees would be healthier and happier and non-smokers would come to restaurants in droves. Smokers too, would soon realize that going outside or to a special smoking room is a small price to pay to enjoy smoke-free food. In short, a smoking ban really would be the best for everyone.
