 If there is a survey about The worst inventions in the world, I guess cigarette can be in the Top ten. We all know the harm of smoking, but there are still a great number of people keep a strong will to smoke. Some of them smoke in public places, which means, they are not only do the harm to themselves, but also others around them. As many countries have published the law to forbid smoking in public places, I think it reflects the most people's will. A person who's smoking besides can be really annoying, and uncomfortable. For those who are sick or have some disease, smoke of cigarette can be very harmful. Smoking is also a risk of making a fire, it makes it very hard to prevent the causes of fire. Also, smoking causes a lot of rubbish. I have smoked the second-hand cigarette from my father for twenty years, so I'm sincerely agree with that smoking should be forbidden in public places. When a person who is addicted to smoke wants to smoke, nothing can stop him. He won't care how others dislike him, what effects he may make, or whether smoking there is forbidden or not. He can smoke in elevators, restaurants, schools or any place. So I think without a law which forbid smoking in public places, such activities can't be stopped. In a word, smoking in public places should be forbidden. And I think there should be a law to make sure the ban can work. This can be better for everyone, and leave us a good surroundings.
