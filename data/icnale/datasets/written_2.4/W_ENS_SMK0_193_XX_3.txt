I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan because it quite clearly is and always has been a health risk to all concerned. Bans are working very effectively in several other countries now and I think that Japan can only benefit by following suit. Although Japan has a large number of smokers who may not be so eager to comply with any bans, I feel that if they were educated as to the dangers that they were presenting to others and not just themselves would go a long way to winning many over I support to the ban. Even so, if they refuse to budge and persist in attempting to block or hinder a restaurant ban, then I think that the Japanese government should enforce the bans with strong financial penalties for the restaurant owners and that those who abuse the bans as well. In this way, I feel that this would send strong messages to smokers and restaurants that the government intends to stand behind the ban and enforce it to the full letter of the law. If this does not act as a sufficient deterrent then perhaps prison time may also be considered as a stronger form of prosecution for would be offenders.
