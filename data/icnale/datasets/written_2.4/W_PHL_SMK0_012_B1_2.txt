We all know that smoking is not only bad for our health, but it's also unhealthy for the people around us. Smoking inside restaurants and even in cafeterias in the country should be banned for they do not only damage the smoker's health but they also affect the other people in the environment. Also, eating in an area where people are smoking sometimes affect our appetite tremendously. Instead of savoring our food, we hastily take it all in because the surrounding isn't appropriate. With this, people may not go to the same restaurant anymore, causing the restaurant to lose a few of their valuable customers. Also, smoking affects our taste buds. We won't enjoy the food that we eat properly because of this. The nutrients of the food may also be gone after this. Most people would argue that smoking shouldn't be banned but rather they should be lessen and in time it will just go away, but I don't think the same. I think that it will never go away if we don't make an action that is in iron hands. It would make a whole lot of difference in people's lives if they are given the chance to eat at a restaurant with a great ambiance and a smoke-free environment.
