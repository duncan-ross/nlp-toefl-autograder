Being a student having a part time job is quite difficult for us. For me it is important for a student to have a part time job because it helps in earning money especially if the student has a financial problem for their education and somehow to supplement family income. They can also improve their time-management skills. A part time job can provide also both training and experience. By working, the students learn about their responsibilities and can also reinforce what they are learning in school. Having an experience in working is a good accomplishment for a student while studying, because like what I have said it is a difficult thing to do for a student having a part time job and at the same time studying. And also it helps the student realize how hard it is to earn money like what their parents are doing. By realizing this, they will start to be thrifty and not to spend their money in buying things that are not important and having no vices. Our parents are going to be very proud of us. For me, making my parents proud will motivate me to study hard and do my job well.
