Speaking of getting part-time job, I keep the neutral thought of it. It can be helpful or harmful, but it depends on how we take jobs. At first, part- time job helps us to be trained well and gains experience. We can get used to outside-world as soon as possible in the near future. Then, we can earn a little money through having a job. It releases the stress of finance support from family. Third, it helps us to know the importance of deposit money. On the whole, part- time job seems to be attractive. On the other hand, it can't be helpful at all. If our part-time job takes too much time and we have little time on studying. It may decrease the grades of our study performance. Then, taking too much time on working would make us feel tired the next day and would fall asleep on classes. It is hard for us to keep up with others in class if our grades decreased for taking too much job. All of above are my opinion on whether part-time job does good for college students. I think there is no certain answer to the issue. Most important at all, before we decide to take part-time job, think twice. To estimate the necessity and benefit at first, If it won't get our study performance bad, it would be a good thing to do.
