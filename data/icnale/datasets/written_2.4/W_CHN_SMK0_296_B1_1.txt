When I go to university or travel to somewhere, I used to choose bullet trains or planes. Not for their high speed but for they being non-smoking vehicles. Even now I could not understand the reason of smoking. Some says that cigarette can excite them and provide energy and others said smoking make them mature enough. Maybe I do not possess any right to blame people smoking because smoking is the liberty of them, but I can blame people who smoking in public areas. Statistics indicates that second hand smoking do more harm than smoking which is quite harmful. Smoking in public areas is a much worse behavior than talking loudly in public place. The latter is just disturbing others while the former is hurting others. What is the most unbearable is that people sometimes smoking in place where I can not avoid the smoke, such as in vehicles, in the meeting room, in the party and so on. Smoking people can not imagine the indignation and upset when non-smoking people smell the smoke and the atmosphere is destroyed. People should consider others feeling and try to learn to think at the position of others. I am really sympathetic to those who are addicted to cigarette while I argue against strongly to smoking in public place.
