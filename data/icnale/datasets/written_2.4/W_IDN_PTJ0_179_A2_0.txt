In this time of tough job market, we need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to field of study, will give an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that have had some real-world, adult experiences and that can handle yourself outside of campus. Aside from making more employable after college, having a part-time job will help financially. A part-time job can help pay for living expenses, including food, books, things, and clothes. This way, not overwhelmed with monthly payments when find self working a much lower paying job than you had hoped for right after college. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of my parents' shoulders if they are helping me with my expenses. Parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner begin this process, the easier it becomes and the faster become 100% independent financially. Therefore I agree that it is important for a college student to have a part time job.
