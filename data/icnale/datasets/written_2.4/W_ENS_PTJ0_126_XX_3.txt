I believe that it is important for students to gain a sense of taking responsibility for their lives, including financially. Regardless of whether their college fees are being funded by their parents, scholarships or by some other means, I feel that it would benefit students greatly, if they were to contribute financially in some way. Whether that is by buying their own books, financing daily living expenses or just paying for their leisure activities, I think that this would assist students with gaining a deeper understanding of the value of money, encourage savings and provide insights towards effective financial planning. Other benefits to be gained would include; additional job experience which, if they were fortunate enough to get a part-time job in their chosen career field, be looked favorably upon by future, prospective employers. The additional job experience would also contribute to their professional development by instilling a responsible work ethic in that they have an obligation to turn up on time and perform and complete tasks at an acceptable, business level. Finally, they would also gain a sense of pride and accomplishment in knowing that they were playing an active role in shaping their lives and not relying on just getting a free ride. For many students, they are in college with a view towards graduating with skills and abilities that will enable them to both, pursue their chosen career paths and or become gainfully employed. The benefits of having a part-time job as described in this essay, would assist them greatly in their future endeavors.
