I agree, but only in the sense that it would really be good for those who have had no real job or work experience before and to get one before they graduate and of course it is a must for the students that need an extra financial resource. On a reality check level, it's a good thing and might also serve to knock the chip off the shoulders of one or two students who could do with a good dose of attitude correctional therapy. For the students that must have a job, it goes without saying that they usually have a better mental approach to working and college. They are more thorough with their work and studies and certainly better organised than most of the others. Partly because they have to be, and partly because they have a clearer understanding of what they need to do and have solid schedule in place to keep them on track. A part-time job can be a blessing or a curse, depending upon each student's emotional maturity levels, outcomes, purpose and actions. Quite often the only difference between those who combine work and college successfully and those who don't is mind set. If the get that part right then students are well on their way and quite likely to achieve their goals.
