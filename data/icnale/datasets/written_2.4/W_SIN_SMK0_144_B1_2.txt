 Smoking, this topic reminds me of a video I had came across a few months back. The health promotion board in Thailand had done up a video to remind us the danger of smoking, interestingly they get the children to involve in this project. Those children were asked to approach smoking adults for lighters to light up the cigarette they holding on, with no second thoughts all the adults rejected their request and even encourage them to quit smoking to avoid future health consequences. So what do you think is the message that this video is trying to send across to us? These adults can remind the children about the danger of smoking, why can't they remind it to themselves and why continue setting the wrong example for our children? They are simply living in self denial, coaxing themselves that smoking causes no harm or they are old enough to care less about their health because we humans eventually die one day but why do they even bother to care about those children. If you're a smoker and you are reading this, please ask yourself this question, "Do you want your kid to smoke?", if no, quit now for your own good and for our future generation.
