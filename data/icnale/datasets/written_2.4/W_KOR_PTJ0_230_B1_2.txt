Recently, lots of students who attend to college have a part-time job. Some of having a part-time job are doing this for their pocket money, and others are doing this which just make use of their spare time. Although I think that it is a difficult thing students to study and do a part-time job at the same time, it is needed experience of students. First, as doing a part-time job, college students can learn social communications. Most of the part-time job we doing are a private tutoring and working in a store such as café, restaurant and so on. That is, we can have opportunity of meeting people other than friends. Second, we can get some independence from parents in the financial aspect. Until now, we often have tendency to depend on our parents about money. However, if we do our part-time job, then we earn a little money. Third, as we doing our part-time job, we can get to know difficulty about earning money so we have more diligence than doing not that. In conclusion, the part-time job has so many advantages for students in the educational, economic aspects for these three reasons. Also, I have two part-time jobs and learn many things from them. Needless to say, the students must study hard for their future. However, the part-time job makes students learn the ways of living in the world. Thus, I strongly think that part-time job is a important thing to students.
