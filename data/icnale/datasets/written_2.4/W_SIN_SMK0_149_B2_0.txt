One of the main contributors to one of the most common and lethal cancer, which is lung cancer, is smoking of cigarettes. In Singapore, in order to reduce the number of lives taken away by lung cancer, smoking has been prohibited in certain public places such as hospitals and bus stops. However, the areas where smoking is prohibited can be potentially expanded to private institutions and places such as restaurants for a wider outreach. As such, it is suggested that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants within the country. Currently, most restaurants partially practice the "Smoking is prohibited" rule in certain parts of their restaurants. However, a smoking corner can usually be found at a restaurant, in a form of a patio or an outlined cornered space. Hence, it may be wiser to completely prohibit smoking throughout the restaurant, reason being that young children may also be at the same restaurant. Although there may be special areas for smokers to puff, young kids are not banned from entering these areas, making them very susceptible to inhaling second-hand smoke. By exposing children to smoke, it increases the chances of health related problems and other potential diseases at a young age. Hence, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the nation, as not only does it pave the way for a larger scale of outreach and impact in terms of reduction of smoking in private establishments, it also reduces the potential harm which children could be exposed to if the children are present in the restaurant.
