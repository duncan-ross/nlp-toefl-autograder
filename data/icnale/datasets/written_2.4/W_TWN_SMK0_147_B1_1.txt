I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several reasons to prove it as below I mentioned. First of all, keep up with the world's current, there are many country set the law that people can't smoke in the public area, of course including restaurant. And the health tax of the cigarette is high than before. Take me for example, my father used to smoke every day, so the expense he spend on buying cigarette, I can buy many things. Second, smoking is harmful to our body. There are some medical reports indicate that smoking will hurt people's lung. It harm to people not only on smoking person, but on people who inhale second-hand smoke. Last but not least, smoking in the restaurant affects atmosphere of eating food. Maybe the food is delicious and smells good. But after inhaling second-hand smoke, and these food's flavor may cover by smoke. Some restaurant would set a smoking area to customers who need to smoke. However, I think this is useless way to separate two kind customers. Though they set specific area, I still can smell the cigarette's smell. To sum up, smoking had many drawbacks, it is not only spend money, but also harm to our body. In this topic, the smoker smoke in the restaurant will affect other customer's mood, what's worse, they may let other people to inhale second-hand smoke and harm to body. Therefore, I do agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
