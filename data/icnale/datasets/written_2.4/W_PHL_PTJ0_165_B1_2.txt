Being a college student means being independent and responsible in life. There are things that you need to start considering particularly your money or allowance. There are college students who are being supported by their parents financially but that is not the case because as a college student we must support our own needs or wants and start looking and have a part-time job. There maybe college students who don't want to work because they are still young or they are being shy but what they don't know is that having a part-time job is not just a source of extra allowance but it will also prepare you in the future after you graduate. If we have part-time job buying things we want won't be that hard anymore or we don't have to ask our parents to buy us some things. Also having a part-time job you'll learn how to budget and manage your allowance because it is your hard earned money. No matter if our parents gave us allowance it is best if we still have a part-time job because we cannot say if it is enough but if we have one we can still support whatever our needs in case we our short in budget. Not only that, because by means of part-time job we learn little by little how to be independent. That is how important part-time job is to college students.
