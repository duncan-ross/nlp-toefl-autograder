I think it is important to have a part-time job. Most of the high school students are not allowed to work, but college students are allowed to do. A lot of students around me are working. Mainly, they work for their living. Most of them still depend on money that their parents send. So, they want to release their parent's burden. Also, college students have many opportunities to eat out and go shopping, therefore they want to have money that they can use freely. As this, there are many reasons for students to work. In fact, there are many good things to have a part-time job. First, through a job, they can have a lot of experiences. For example, I experienced difficulties to communicate with customers and to stand still for six hours without taking a break. I felt it was too hard to earn money. I thanked my father for his hard every day working. Second, by saving their salary, they can do more things than ever did. They can go abroad or buy what they want. Finally, they come to know the responsibility that is needed in society. Their experiences will be a key for their future. Therefore I truly think it is essential for college students to have a part-time job.
