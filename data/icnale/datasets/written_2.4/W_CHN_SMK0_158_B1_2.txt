 It is a common phenomenon that smoking in the restaurants in the country is very popular, which we can notice everywhere. Should it be completely banned? Certainly, I believe. It is widely known that more and more people have joined the group of smokers. While the whole society is making efforts to stop them from smoking. From my point of view, in the first place, smoking does harm to one's health, which also affect the people who breathe it nearby, which is even worse. Especially in public places, restaurants, many people around the smokers, they are really victims in fact. Secondly, the behavior of smoking cigarettes, which is generally accepted that it is a bad habit, a waste of money and, more importantly, waste your time. It may have a bad influence on the people especially the young in the restaurant. Thirdly, the pollution to the environment is inevitable, and it may easily cause air pollution even a fire while you are careless to throw it on the dangerous place. I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, which is better for everyone in the public, and as well as the environment.
