 Smoking is harmful to your health. Smoking is harmful to health, smoking is not only harmful to smokers themselves, but only harmful to others who are not smoking, and second hand smoking is more dangerous. Just imagine that, you and your dear friends were having delicious food in a closed, well decorated, and have good atmosphere restaurant, you were happy. But suddenly you smelled something bad, something is poisonous, you would find it destroy everything, like atmosphere and tasty cakes, not to speak of your happiness. As I have mentioned above, smoking can do harm to every person around the cigarette, even there was a few surveys said that the one who is not smoke but only smell it can be more dangerous. Smoking is one behavior that harms others but bring no profit to itself either. Public places like museums, swimming pools, cinemas and some big restaurants say that NO SMOKING, because there are too many people, and I think there is just not any reason for smokers smoking in public places especially in the restaurants, all kinds of restaurants. Eating is one of the most important things in human's life, and for that reason we should have our breakfast, lunch and supper with a good mood, we must forbid smokers smoking at our eating time. So Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
