I do strongly agree, because the restaurant is the public place there for everyone can use service there. The most of people hates smoke smell if there are smokers in the restaurant and they are smoking and the bad smell will bother other people also, they will not enjoy with their meal then get upset. The big problem is we did not smoke but we have to get toxin which we did not produce but other smoker did it. Everyone knows that smoking does not benefit to heath and people who are around us. Imagine that while we are enjoying with the meal and there is someone is smoking and the smell is very bad I think that we will go to bad mood for surly. If the restaurant allow the some customers smoking than the others customer who are not smoking will not go that place because it is dirty means that it dirty full of smoking smell and makes the atmosphere of the restaurant looking bad. It is not a good thing if you are smoking because the children will copy that bad behavior and that that will be the problem. There are a lot of champagnes that try to help smoker to give smoking up if the restaurant agree to ban smoking that will help them to try to give smoking up in order to get into that restaurant and everyone will be happy while the meal.
