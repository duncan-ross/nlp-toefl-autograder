I think it is necessary for us to prohibit from smoking in the restaurant. In the restaurant we should enjoy having lunch and conversation and so on. I think it is needless to smoke at this place. Generally speaking, a smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer. I can't find the advantage to smoke. And to smoke in the public place such as a restaurant also influences for nonsmoker. It is difficult to shut off the smoke completely. For nonsmoker there is no such troublesome thing like this. If we suffer from disease because of other's smoke, can we allow that we are made to do so? Of course I can't allow them. Recently, people that smoke tobacco have been given a card. The card called TASPO. When we buy a tobacco, we have to show the card. I think this means recognizing the danger of the smoke in the society. If tobacco doesn't affect our health, the card is not invented. Restaurant is used a lot of people. But there are not people who take a trouble to smoke. So there is no necessity to provide smoker's room at the place of a meal. That's why I agree the statement prohibiting from smoking at the restaurant.
