I don't agree because I think that this is more to do with being a private, informal arrangement between restaurant owners and people who patronise their restaurants. The owners either allow smoking on the premises or they do not. If patrons find a smoking restaurant offensive then it is a simple decision not to go to smoking restaurants. I am not sure if the Japanese Government has a say in this side of things under Japanese law and I am not a lawyer. Like most governments though, I suppose that they could either re-write or override and laws really since they are the government. I don't smoke but I have friends that do and they are usually quite considerate about where they blow their smoke. Not that I am making excuses and I neither condemn them or condone their smoking because it is their lives after all and provided they do not infringe on mine or anyone else's health than I guess that they are free to do as they like. So long as they are obeying the local laws of the land wherever they may happen to reside than I think that it is a case of live and let live.
