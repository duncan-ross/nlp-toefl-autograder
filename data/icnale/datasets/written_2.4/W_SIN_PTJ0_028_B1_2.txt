How important it is for college students to have a part-time job depends very much on the circumstance he is in. If the student requires the job to support himself and even his family, it would likely be important for him to hold a part-time job. If on the other hand, the student has no need to work to support himself financially, a part-time job is optional and not of great importance. The notion of financial independence is dependent on the individual's own values. If the student deems it important for him to earn his own money, a part-time job would naturally be important for him. Vice versa, it is unimportant for one who does not see meaning in having a job to work. It is arguable that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to inculcate the value of independence. However, independence need not necessarily be gained from a job; the student would also be likely to gain financial independence after graduation when he works. Financial gains, however, is not the only merit to a job. The worth of a part-time job can be judged by the lessons and experiences one would learn through it. In this respect, it is actually worth encouraging college students to work, especially if the nature of the job is related to his area of study and intended career. However, a part-time job is not essential, nor of great importance to a college student.
