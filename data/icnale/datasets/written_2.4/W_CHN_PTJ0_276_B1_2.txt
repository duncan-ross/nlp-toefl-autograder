Shakespeare has ever said, to be or not to be, that is a question. When facing this topic, I want to make a little change, to have a part-time job or not, that is a problem. This topic is hot discussed by people nowadays. People's opinions vary sharply. As far as I am concerned, there are three major views. The majority of people especially the parents think it is of great importance for those young adults to get a part-time job, which they think will make college students have a better understanding to the society. Most students in China have few opportunity to touch the society, resulting in the problem of high score but low level of ability. So these people encourage the college students to find a part-time job. However, part of people hold the completely opposite opinion. They think have a part time job will have side effect on those students. firstly, taking a part-time job will occupy too much time. Secondly, college students are too young to get involved in this complex society. they will be cheated, which is dangerous. Thirdly, these young adults may have less interest in study. On top of the two viewpoints, I subscribe to another opinion. I believe there is no standard answer. Whether it is important or necessary depends on ourselves. As we students' conditions are different from each other, when we think about whether we should go to take a part-time job, we should list the advantages or disadvantages according to our situation. Whether you choose work now or later, once you make your own decision, try to suggest you that you have make a correct decision and persist in doing it to obtain what you originally thought that you will harvest.
