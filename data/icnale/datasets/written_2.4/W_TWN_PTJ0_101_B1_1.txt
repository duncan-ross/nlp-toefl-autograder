I don't this students have part time job is important. Because a part time job may decrease the time they study further more they may be tired when they in class or can't be focus on the courses. Beside, I think the time we can be a student is valuable, for a student can have a lot of learning resources, and cheap learning opportunities, most important of all, students are allowed to make mistakes. Therefore the students can try to do anything they want; by this way they will have the chance to inspire their mind. The students also will have more creativity. As the reason above, I think for the most of the students' opening mind and the development of the creative thinking, students should treasure the time when being a student. However if the students really need the money, I think I will support them. For if they have no money or they have difficulty on their basic living, therefore I think they won't have time to think how to improve their study. A part time job except can make money it still can learn some experience about the job or how to cooperate with other people. Those experiences are also very valuable, though they sacrifice some of their student time learning in school, I think they just transform their learning model. Under the condition that they don't give up their learning attitude, they do part time job is for the reason they want to keep learning, they just learn in different places.
