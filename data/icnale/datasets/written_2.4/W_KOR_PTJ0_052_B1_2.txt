To work and study 1. You will have enough money to gain higher education and, thus, achieve your dream. 2. You will gain a very important experience, working with people, which you will not be able to gain in a college/university. 3. You will have an opportunity to hold a good post in company you work for as a part-time employee. 4. You will learn to manage your time effectively. 5. You will understand what it means to be independent from your parents or anyone. And, of course, you will learn what real life is, and what to expect after graduation. Most students cannot even imagine what they will face in their real life. Not to work and study 1. Sometimes people forget to study, and their part-time job absorbs them completely. You should remember that your study is the most important. 2. Of course, you will have less free time than other students. But this can be good as well you will be earning money when your fellow students will stupidly spend their parents' money. 3. You will not be able to join all those societies. Do you really need all of them? But you will be able to focus on those activities you really need. Of course, you will have more points which depend on some features of your life, but these points need to be thought over for you to make the right decision.
