Today the rate of smokers in the whole world are increase than before. We can find the smokers almost in every public place, including in restaurant. But I think there must be a rule in every restaurant that banned people for smoking. As we know, almost every restaurant use Air Conditioner so the room is kept. If somebody is smoking in restaurant, the smoke will keep stay in the room and be inhaled by the other people in that room. Of course it will give a bad impact in people healthy especially for the secondhand smokers because the smoke from the cigarette is containing many kind of chemical substance that can be poison for human body. Beside it, the smoke also can disturb the comfortable of another costumers in restaurant. People will not feel comfy when they are eating and smelling the smoke of cigarette. The clothes that they are wearing also will smelt of the smoke of cigarette. If people feel not comfy, they will think twice to spend their money and time in that restaurant, and sure it is not good for the restaurant owner. So, if every restaurant owner want their customers stay eat at their restaurant, they should make the rule that ban the smokers to smoke at their restaurant.
