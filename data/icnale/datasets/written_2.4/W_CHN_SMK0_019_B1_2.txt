I am one of the angry peoples who couldn't enjoy their meals when someone is smoking at the restaurant. So if someone asks me Do you think smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants? I will absolutely say Yes! As it is known to us, smoking is bad for us. Some people like smoking very much and can't live without cigarettes even though it writes Smoking is bad for your health on every cigarette case. I have no right to command you to get rid of smoking and you have also no right to destroy my health and even my life. We should respect and understand each other. Please smoke in private instead of in public! There are more reasons for this as follows: Firstly, restaurants are the place of eating and drinking rather than smoking. If you usually smoke at the restaurant, the other customers will be interrupted and don't feel happy. In the long run, it will contribute to the decrease of the restaurant's sale. Secondly, smoking is sometimes dangerous and may cause a fire disaster. If someone throw the cigarette on the xylem floor or near the curtain, it is easy to cause a fire and lead to a tragedy. Thirdly, your smoking at a restaurant will give your friends and partners a bad impression. Everyone wants to be polite and friendly in the front of his or her friends. Smoking at the restaurant will destroy your appearance. From what has been mentioned above, we can come to the conclusion that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. It is good for the smokers' impression, the others' health and also the safety of the public!
