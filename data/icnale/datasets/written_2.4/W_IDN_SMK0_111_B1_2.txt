Nowadays, the increasing of smoker amount is becoming our vital problem. Even smoking can cause a lot of disadvantages, they still won't stop smoking. As everybody has known, by smoking, it can cause a lot of healthy problems, like cancer, the change of your teeth color, impotent, and much more. It also can affect the passive smoker ones. Only by breathing the smoke, we have the same chance like an active smoker to have a healthy problem. Then what we can do as a passive smoker to prevent it? What we can only do is hoping the government will make a rule that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. It can help us so we can breathe the fresh air even though only in restaurant. At least, we can have a meal without smoke around the restaurant atmosphere. In some cases, smokers are still around. If that happens, we might ask the smoker not to smoke at that time or we go to another place that has no smoker in it. To conclude this essay, I restate that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. It is because not every people smoke and not every people like being around the smoker.
