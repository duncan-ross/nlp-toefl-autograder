Should smoking be completely banned at all restaurants? Smokers will say no. Nonsmokers will say of course! Although the government has published some laws to ban smoking in public places and some restaurants, there are still amount of restaurants ignore these laws. Most people know that cigarettes include a lot of harmful chemical compositions. These compositions are not only harmful for smokers but also nonsmokers. The smoke compounding with the air filling the place which the smokers smoke will harm pregnant women, children and so on. Doctors suggest that smoking will enhance the rate of getting cardiac disease, high temperature and lung cancer etc. Furthermore, it can also have a bad effect on babies' and children's brain development. As for me, I hate the smell of the cigarettes. I believe that there are a lot of people like me don't like the smell. Especially in restaurants! People go to a restaurant to have a meal. In many times, they want to celebrates something or want a good temperature during a meal. Nobody wants to smell that. Thus, from these aspects, I would say smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, even in many public places such as movie theater and school, in the country.
