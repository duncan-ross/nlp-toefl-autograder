I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As everyone knows, smoking is bad for people's health. A cigarette contains many chemicals, many of which are poisonous, and it can cause cancer so we don't encourage people to smoke even forbid it in some he specific place such as schools or public places. Although whether he smoke or not is his free will, we have no right to interfere his behavior; however, a person smokes, he will make external cost. No one likes secondhand smoking. It is said that both smoking and secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer, breast cancer; however secondhand smoking is more deadly so we have to say no to secondhand smoke bravely. People should respect each other so smokers should respect others who don't smoke and hate secondhand smoke. According to this reason, smokers have better to prohibit in the place where people gather, and the restaurants is the place that people eat in so if someone smoke in the restaurants, it will destroy its atmosphere. Particularly, if a person smoke in the indoor restaurant, the air in it must be extremely bad. That will affect that customers' mood. I agree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.
