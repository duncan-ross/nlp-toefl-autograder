Smoking is a personal habit, which must not violate the others' rights for clean air. Especially in restaurants people want to enjoy their meals in relaxed atmosphere and spend good time. While non-smoking customers are having their meals, the smoking customers should think of others' right to enjoy their time and meals as more important ones than smokers' rights in this case. Because only when one does not violate the others own rights, he can claim his own right. In many coffee shops in Korea, there are many special cells for smoking people, which have tables and chairs. The coffee shops want to protect non-smokers' rights to be separated from the smokers and also satisfy smoking customers at the same time. However, whenever the smoking customers enter and leave the cells, the smoke comes out of the cells and the people outside of the cells can smell the foul scent. It still limit non-smokers' rights for clean air. So I hope the restaurant not to choose the same policy as the coffee shops now have. I want the restaurant have strict policy about smoking in their restaurants in order to protect non-smokers' rights.
