I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known that smoking is harmful to our bodies. When smokers light the cigarette at the restaurants, not only do they harm themselves, it also affects people around them, who become second hand smokers unknowingly. It is unfair to these non-smokers as they take in second hand smoke which is a lot more toxic than first hand smoke. By banning smoking at all the restaurants, it provides a clean environment for people to dine in. Over time, the country will be well known for their goal to promote a smoke-free milieu, just like how Singapore is known as the "clean and green country" and this may boost tourism and investment opportunities and hence, create economic growth. Furthermore, it will increase societal awareness that smoking is detrimental to one's health and hence discourage people from smoking. Over the years, the government has been highlighting the negative effects of smoking, from posting gruesome pictures on the cigarette boxes to advertising in newspapers and on the television. Hence, these strict laws can persuade smokers to have second thoughts before lighting the cigarette and encourage them to quit smoking.
