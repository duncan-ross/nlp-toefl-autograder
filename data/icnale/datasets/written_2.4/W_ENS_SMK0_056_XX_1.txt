Smoking can cause many health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema. Accordingly, it should not be allowed in restaurants especially ones where there are many children present. I recently read a study in which it was shown that many smokers simply decided to quit after smoking was banned in restaurants, and I think this situation would hold true for Japan as well, so it may be beneficial for the health of their people as a whole if they would ban smoking in their restaurants. That study also showed that heart disease was reduced by 5% in the five years after smoking was banned at the restaurants in that state. With this direct an obvious link between banning smoking in restaurants in increased levels of health in the populace, I don't see how there can be any other outcome than that smoking will eventually be banned in restaurants. So why don't nations and governments take the plunge and go ahead and get it over with because there's just no way that smoking will be allowed in restaurants forever. Having smoking and nonsmoking areas does not adequately address the problem, and the only way to fully address the problem is to just ban smoking altogether.
