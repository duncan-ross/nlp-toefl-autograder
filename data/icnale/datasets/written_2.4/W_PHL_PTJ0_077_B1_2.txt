As a college student, I think, part-time jobs are very important because of several reasons. First, part-time jobs provide lenient working hours for people who are often busy during the morning like college students. Part-time jobs are often 4-5 hours depending on the part-timer's schedule. It is a very flexible working hour wherein one can go to work during his or her convenient time. For example, a college student who goes to university from 7:30 am up to 4:30 pm and who does not have much to do on his or her schedule beyond 4:30 pm can apply for a part-time job of 5 pm onwards. The college student can choose a schedule of work that best suits his/her and does not, in anyway, be too inconvenient for her especially when he/she goes to the university. College students like me could gain salaries that are of great help, especially with our expenses while we are studying. We could use our hard-earned money for our allowances, buying books, and even for paying our tuition fees which could also be beneficial to our parents who spend a lot paying for our education. Another good thing about part-time job is that it gives us students experience in the field of work. We could choose a part-time job that is related to our field of study which could give us an idea of what kind of job we could do after we graduate. Experience is the best teacher as they say and gaining this experience from part-time job would be of great help. It is beneficial and it is of importance to develop university students.
