I agree because students aside from a minority, who do engage in part-time positions while at college generally tend to perform and function better than many of their counterparts. I believe this can be attributed to the extra discipline and responsibility that is required to engage in work at study at the same time. Added to this is the extra skill that must be learned in order to be successful in both endeavours and you may end up with a reasonably well rounded student. That's just my opinion of course but I do believe that I have seen enough test cases to support my opinion and if one were to survey any group f colleges and conduct some preliminary research, I also feel that it would also prove my theory to some extent. Not everyone is successful though however the drop off rate is considerably low compared to the number of students who take on part-time work. Generally speaking I feel that it is till important for all students to work part-time because if they don't try then they will never know what the outcome would have been and also because of the opportunity to learn additional skills to supplement there college studies.
