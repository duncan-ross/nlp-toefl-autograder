One day, they will regret it later because not only will you possibly die, but along with that they will get sick and wont be very pretty. Nails will turn brown, lips will turn black, etc. Why did they still smoke even they know that smoking is very bad for their health? Because millions of people are addicted to smoking, and thousands more become addicted every year. he reason why people get addicted to any type of tobacco product is because all tobacco products have nicotine in them, which is the addictive ingredient (American Thoracic Society).
