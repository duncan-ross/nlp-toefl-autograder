As college students, should we expect our parents to pay for all of our tuition and board expenses, or should we begin to learn about the real world and the important topic of financial responsibility? I tend to lean towards the latter as I feel that students often spend too long holding on to their childhood and refusing to grow up. My dad is always telling me how I should have to contribute towards my bills, car expenses, books and other expenses. He says when he was in college he worked more than 30 hours per week at a part-time job and still graduated early. He feels that he set the bar pretty high and I should be able to at least keep up with him. Honestly I have to say that I agree, but sometimes it gets tiring to hear him say the same thing over and over again. Most of my friends have part-time jobs and they seem to do well when it comes to balancing their schedules and managing their time well. I think their only a few students were so busy with school that they cannot find any time to invest in a part-time job, and so there's really no excuse for being a bum.
