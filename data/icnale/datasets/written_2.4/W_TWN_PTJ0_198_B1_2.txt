In my opinion, it is not only important but necessary for a college student to have a part-time job. Since we are not the kids who lack the abilities and qualification to work, it is the right time we lighten our parents' burden. In the past few years, our parents have worked so hard to equip us with knowledge and skills. Now, we are old enough to depend on ourselves. We should get those knowledge and skills to be used. More or less money we receive is not the point. The thing that matters is our getting to be more like adults. However, some may misunderstand the true meaning of getting a part-time job. We all heard of some news of girls using sex for money. I think a part-time job should be helpful. For example, a student major in Laws can be an assistant for a lawyer. Being a waiter in a restaurant may seem like a good idea for someone who would like to open a restaurant as well. What these part-time give you should not just the cash. Instead, work experience related to what you have studied matters more. It helps a lot when we try to impress the interviewer. There is another reason why getting a part-time job. Through that, we can earn a sense of accomplishment and get to know that it is hard to earn the money. Further, we will treasure every cent and make good use of it. In a word, getting a part-time job is important for a college student.
