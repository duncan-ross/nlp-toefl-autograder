Certainly, smoking is not only an unhealthy habit that has detrimental effects on the smoker; it also comes with many negative externalities that harm the people around him, such as when they inspire second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is in fact more harmful that first-hand smoke, and scientific research has shown that it is a key underlying cause of various diseases such as lung cancer, respiratory failures and high blood pressure. The smoke also negatively impacts the environment when it enters the atmosphere and causes air pollution, or even global warming. This is essentially why many governments have enacted legislation that bans and fines smoking in many public places, such as air-conditioned malls, in view of protecting the general public's welfare and the environment. This is to make smokers take into account the negative externalities that they bring upon non-smokers and the environment. While it certainly benefits me and other non-smokers if the state bans smoking in all restaurants in the country, I feel that the right should still be given to the restaurant owners. At the same time, the choice of patronizing a restaurant that allows smoking falls on the customer. If the restaurant experiences a fall in revenue due to a loss of non-smoker customers, they would probably decide to implement the ban.
