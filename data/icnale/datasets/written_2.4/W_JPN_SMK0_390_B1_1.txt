I'm of the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think so because I have ??? reasons. The first reason is that smoking does harm to not only smoking person but also the people around him. He is free, to be sure, to do something he wants to do. But, he doesn't have a right that he does harm to other people. Moreover, they have a right that they are healthy to live a long time. Furthermore, smoking does harm to them worse than him. I think that this action is very selfish. The second reason is that smoking has a bad influence on smoking person's health and the cigarettes are too expensive. Moreover, the cigarette's price keeps on increasing because the government will decide to add to cigarette's tax. The smoking persons pay a lot of money and are done harm to by the cigarettes. I don't think that is a very good idea. The third reason is that the most people around the smoking person feel unpleasant. If many people feel unpleasant when they are walking, they feel so when they are eating. People shouldn't do something other people feel so as possible as they could. Therefore Japanese's government should ban from smoking in restaurants.
