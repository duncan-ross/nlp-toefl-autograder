Smoking, everyone will know that is carcinogenic. Even more frequently to reduce the shock of your life with a bad breath, black teeth, liver cancer, lung cancer and another diseases. so everyone would see ads on TV now that you know me? You to hurt me burn At that time everyone will hate you a lot of sense. However smoking is not bad for health. Should turn out to play sports. Will make your life better, however it should not be smoking in restaurants because it might hurt someone you love with absorption the smoke of cigarettes. I suggest that the government should fine or punish someone who don't follow rules that we set. Many restaurants stick the signs in front of the restaurants that 'No Smoking' it said that if you smoke, you will be fined for 2000 baht. I think it should be more to stop people to smoke in the restaurant. The fine should increase, and they may go to jail for a night. So they will know how bad. If they don't love their health they can smoke but other around they love their heath so don't hurt people. They should respect people right and don't do such this bad manner in the restaurant.
