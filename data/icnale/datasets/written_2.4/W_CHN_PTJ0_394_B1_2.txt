 Nowadays taking a part-time job is popular among college students, some people just try it without having a consideration about whether they really need to so. For me, I think take a part-time job can be better for someone, but it is not necessary for every college students. Part-time job can always be attractive to those college students. First of all they can get salary, which means that they start the first step to be independent. Second, they think they can get much experience and so called skills. And, it can also be a way to spend spare time. Usually part-times faced to students are just waiters or waitress, write or tape some documents, help promote some products. Could it help us that much just like someone imagined? Maybe money attracts many students. For those who are not very rich it can obviously be helpful. But such works may be not supervised or even dangerous, maybe what you take can't match what you have done. Students get paid for times or hours, with not much money, sometimes even get no money, just some useless things or meals. Do we really need or care about the money? If no, than it is unnecessary. As for experience and skills, I don't think each part-time job can give us much. Some works doesn't have much meaning. Everyone can do these works. No experience, no technique, it doesn't matter, you can learn what to do in a few minutes, even there's no need to learn. How much can we learn from such easy works? Maybe not much as supposed. So, part-time job can help college students in some aspects, but it is not necessary for us. Before taking a part-time job, we should think carefully.
