Nowadays, it is universally acknowledged that smoking really does harm to our health. The sign of No Smoking can be seen everywhere in public places, such as vehicles, hospitals, of course restaurants and so on. So I'm for the idea that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in one country. For one thing, assuming that a restaurant is crowded with a number of smokers, how can the others around have a meal in such an atmosphere. Probably, the smoke can result in the disgust of other customers, who are considered to belong to the so-called indirect smokers. If they have been in a situation like that for a long time, their health will be ruined sooner or later, what's worse, there even exists a possibility for them to get a cancer. For another, there are so many things easily to cause a fire especially in a restaurant that we should focus more attention on smoking. In case that people casually throw away smoked cigarettes in a restaurant, I can't imagine how severe the consequence will be. It's high time that we took some efficient measures to prevent people from smoking in public. Taking our health and safety into consideration, we may as well avoid contacting with smokers too frequently.
