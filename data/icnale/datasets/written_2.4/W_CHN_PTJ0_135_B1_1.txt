Nowadays, we turn lazier and lazier with our life's being more and more well-off. Perhaps you are very unhappy to hear this, but it's the truth.. Especially in our parents' protective wings, we lack the passion of doing hard works. Before we went to college, our parents had designed the future life for us. So we are used to accepting their arrangements and don't want to pay too much. Unlikely to our parents, they did many hard labors when they were youngsters. Therefore, I think it's reasonable that many people called this generation to be the flowers in warm house. Thus, I don't like this opinion. To get rid of this saying, I advise that all college students do part-time job. It is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, many college students have been addicted to their parents' concern for a long time so as to lose their self-existence ability. Taking a part-time job can force them learning how to be independent. Secondly, it will make them treasure money and don't waste money. Thirdly, it can help them form working experience so that they will be easier to find a decent job after they graduate from college. It is acknowledged that almost every company has demand in employee's working experience when they employ a stuff. Forthly, it can strongthern their mental ability in bearing failure. You know, to a person never meet any difficulity, once he suffers from a few obstales, maybe he will break down. Concludely, in my perspective, it has necessity that we should stumilate college students' motivation in doing part-time job. In modern society, inevitably, a person who can only study in books wouldn't be accepted by the public.
