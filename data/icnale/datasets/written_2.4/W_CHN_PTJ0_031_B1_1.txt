Nowadays, more and more college students choose to get a part-time job. Some students take a part-time job to enrich their college life. Some other students have a part-time job just because they want to get some money. Is it important for college students to have a part-time job?Personally, I think taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich our college life. We can learn a lot by doing this. And the working experience in turn will have great influence on us. Besides, we can also become independent by taking a part time job because we can earn money from doing part-time job. At the same time, we can reduce some family burden from our parents. But on the other hand, taking a part-time job may have bad effects on our study. Some students spend too much time doing part-time job and they don't have enough time for their study. So it is not very good for them. After all, study is the most important thing for us students. Having a part-time job has its advantages and disadvantages. And in my opinion, we can take a part-time job if it has little influence on our studying. So if you can keep the balance between your part-time job and your study, try to find a part-time job now.
