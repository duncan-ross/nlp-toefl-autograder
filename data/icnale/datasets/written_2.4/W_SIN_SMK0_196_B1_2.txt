I agree with this statement. Smoking in restaurants will definitely have an effect on the environment of that restaurant. This in turn can affect the restaurant's customer satisfaction, especially families with kids or non-smokers. This is because second-hand smoke can also be detrimental to health. Moreover, most coffee shops and bus-stops in Singapore already banned smoking. This is to discourage smoking and also to help prevent non-smokers from coming into contact with second-hand smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, it would help to achieve this aim even further. On the other hand, by banning smoking at all restaurants in the country may result in restaurants losing customers who smoke as they now would not have the freedom to smoke in the compound and may turn to coffee shops, that allow smoking, to dine instead. Currently in Singapore, there are an increasing proportion of non-smokers relative to smokers thus the focus should be put on non-smokers. Although banning smoking in restaurants will make them lose their smoking customers, this policy would be able to attract non-smokers, which is a larger number in Singapore, to dine at restaurants. Banning smoking would do more good than harm as smoking causes more harm to the human body in the long term than the temporary mental enjoyment during smoking. Therefore in conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
