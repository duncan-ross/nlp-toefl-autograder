I disagree that is should be banned by any government anywhere. This is a personal choice situation between smokers, non-smokers and the restaurants. The government has no business being involved in any restaurant bans. While it is understood that there is no question that smoking causes disease and numerous deaths in Japan and other countries each year, unless the government own the restaurants. Then it is clearly a private issue in which the government should not be involved. As to the ban, I would say that if non-smokers don't link sharing restaurants with smokers then the best thing to do is not go to smoking restaurants. Smokers have just as much right to be on private property smoking if the owner of the property allows them to and if they are not breaking any laws. If restaurants wish to ban smoking on their property and convert to a non-smoking restaurant then that is the right to do so and they should not have this dictated to them by any government. By the same token, if we allow governments to intervene in the private sector whenever they like, then the government would then be stepping out of government mode and becoming a business entity which it should never do.
