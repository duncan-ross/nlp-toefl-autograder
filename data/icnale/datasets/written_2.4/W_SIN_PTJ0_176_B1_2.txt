I agree with this statement in that these college students can benefit tremendously from their working experience in the part-time jobs. One direct benefit would be a better resume that would be more appealing to their prospective employers and hence heightening their chances of landing a job ultimately upon graduation. Also, it has also been increasingly recognised that one requires one than just academic excellence to survive the stiff competition in the job market, and having some working experience would surely set one apart from the competitors. Similarly, the experience and soft skills that one can get from these jobs first hand is not something that they can easily acquire in a classroom setting. All these benefits that one can get from a part-time job all the more explains why having more working experience should be encouraged among these college students. Despite all these undisputable advantages and learning experiences one can gain from his or her part-time job, I believe that we should ultimately leave it to the individuals to decide for themselves. For instance, if one is not as confident in multi-tasking, he or she might prefer to have a part-time job only in the vacation period so as to not jeopardise his or her studies. Similarly, a student who excels in time management could possibly afford to work part-time during the semester.
