Smoking is banned at some restaurants in Taiwan because the smell from cigarette may bother others who enjoy their meal. Whether smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants or not has been discussed for a long time, and I disagree that smoking is banned completely. Taiwanese residents are allowed to smoke at some restaurants, such as restaurants related to sports, and people can view the live game at this kind of restaurant. People at this restaurant can smoke when enjoy their meal, or watch the live Major League game. In fact, the smell from cigarette has become the symbol of our culture. Seeing Cheng-Min Wang strikes out the batter, the audience will not only feel excited but smell the smell. From the proceeding reason, this interesting culture might be transformed into a boring one when smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are places where people can smoke at almost all of the restaurants in Taiwan. According to my father, who has smoked for beyond 20 years, he states that he will feel painful if he does not smoke in one day; therefore, it is cruel that people is unable to smoke at restaurant because smoking people cannot stand the impulse to smoke. In conclusion, it is incorrect that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In some restaurants in Taiwan, smoking has become residents' habits, even become the culture in the area. And people cannot stand the impulse to smoke although smoking is banned at all the restaurants. All in all, I disagree with this idea.
