Although I've been living in the US for almost 15 years, when I was in university in college in the UK, it was not so common for college students to have a part-time job. Education assistance in the UK and the U. S. are very different, and I would assume that the Japanese educational system is very different as well. Of course, a part-time job can facilitate a student in becoming more responsible and otherwise be a more contributing member of the college or university, ball when I was in school no one had time to do anything other than study. This may also vary depending on the students program of study, and I would further assumed that there are probably students like we eat with almost no time to work, and on the opposite side, there are students with a lot of time to work. As a result of this, perhaps it is up to the student to decide if it is appropriate for them to have a part-time job or not. For some students, it could be very important, their time might be spent better investing that time in other pursuits. At least for my own experience, it is not so important for college students to have a part-time job.
