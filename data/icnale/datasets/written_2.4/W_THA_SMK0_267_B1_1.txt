I think I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is very danger in a lot of case. Smoker will think that they are only person who receive the effects of smoking, but they are wrong. They can hurting themselves and other people by smoking. People who stay around them such as their family, their friends, and people who they don't know would receive the effects like them too. Because there are smokers and non smokers in every places that some people have to breathe the smoke from smokers. These case is well-known as Secondhand Smoke. This is a very serious problem that happen in every countries all around the world. Smoking is not good for everybody's health because of many reasons. For example, it smoke can damage important genes that control about the growth which a direct causes cancer. Moreover, it can also cause lung diseases, kills brain cells, and it also have the effects about beauty such as woman's skin. Pollution is a most important reason too. Smoking is a cause and form of pollution because there is a lot of toxic gases from smoking that can damage the environment such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Because of these reason, smoking will have the effects to everybody. If it have smoking in the restaurant, it will make the restaurant bad. It must have bad smell from smoking that cause the bad atmosphere in the restaurant. No one wants to sit down and see smoke floating around their food and all the other people in the restaurant. Many people will not eat in a restaurant where they allow smoking. The restaurant will lose of customers, and it also lose of credits.
