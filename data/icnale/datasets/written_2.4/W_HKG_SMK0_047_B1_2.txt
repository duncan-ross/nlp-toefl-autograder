The recent research shows that the consequence of smoking is become more serious. The situation of smoking in Hong Kong is reaching the alarming stage now. Therefore, whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants become the talk of the town. Personally, I strongly believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. I have numerous reasons why I hold this view and I would like to express the most important ones here. To commence with, there is perhaps nothing more important than keeping the health of customers. During a cigarette is ignited, there will be second-hand smoke released from it. The second-hand smoke even cause greater adverse effects to the others. How can the smokers force others to breath in the toxic gas? Although the smoker may argue that others may leave the restaurants so that they don't have to breath in the toxic gas, others have to finish their meal before finished their meal. Therefore, it is a must to stop second-hand smoke in the restaurant. What's more, it is advisable to stop smoking in order to increase the profit of the restaurant. If the customers are allowed to smoke in a restaurant, the smokers will go to these restaurants to have their meal. However, other non-smokers will not go to these restaurants due to there will be a lot of second-hand smoke there. The second-hand smoke will not only affect the taste of the food but also affect the health of the other customers. As the number of non-smokers is much more than the smokers, the restaurant will lose the market of non-smoker and lose the profit. All in all, it is no doubt that there are many benefits for banning smoking in all restaurants. Therefore, I think the government should legislate to ban smoking in restaurant now.
