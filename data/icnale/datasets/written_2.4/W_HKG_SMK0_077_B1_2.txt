Have you ever experienced that the one sitting next to you is smoking while you are having your meal? If you are a non-smoker, how will you feel? Whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants has been long a controversial issue and I utterly support the statement. One of the reasons is that passive smoking is detrimental to others. If someone smokes in a restaurant, the people around he or she will even suffer more. The people around the smokers will take in the secondhand smoke which gives rise to a lot of respiratory diseases to human bodies, even some deathly diseases, say, lung cancer. Another reason is that smoking harms the natural habitat. It causes air pollution which is the main factor for the formation of acid rain. Acid rain corrodes marble sculpture. It is also harmful to marine life and the growth of plants. Somebody may claim that the ban is in fact taking away the rights of smokers. But as long as smoking causes detrimental effects to not only the one self, but also the others and the natural environment, it is an extremely selfish behavior. It is concluded that smoking in restaurants is causing no benefit but harms, therefore smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
