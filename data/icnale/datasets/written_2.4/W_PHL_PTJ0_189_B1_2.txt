Literate people can read and write but normal people cannot read and write two different things at the same time. There is such thing called multi-tasking, though. It is the ability to do two or more things at the same time. Everyone has done that but to be able to do one's best, one has to focus on doing one thing at a time. For instance, when singing and dancing, one must learn to either sing the song or dance to the beat first before being able to do the same at the same time really well. If not, it may take time before the performer masters his or her job. This is because the person will be confused if he or she hasn't mastered at least one of the routine prior to the joint performance. This concept is same with the concept of working students. They will not be able to do their best in the academic aspect since their time and attention is divided. Studying alone is a lot different and has more advantages as opposed studying while working. As of now, a lot of students prefer to work while studying. We cannot blame them for choosing to do so because they have a reason for that: lack of money. On the bright side, it may still be added to their credentials and this will be an advantage as they apply for a job. Personally, I have high respect for students who work for part time jobs. What they're doing requires a lot of patience, hard work and sacrifice. The experience they have earns them the values they gain and honor they deserve.
