I agree with this opinion. Because I think it is important for university students to learn social system and social manner and so on. Having a part – time job teaches them importance of moneys and working. But in college, students can't learn such things. For example, my part – time job is a home tutor and teacher in tutoring school. I teach children Mathematics and English and so on. And I mix with them, taking with them. The part – time job is very fun and, and I think that I can't experience such things in university. Of course, it is the most important for them to study. But college student will start working in society after they graduated from university. So they should have an experience in advance. Furthermore, most of them have a lot of free time. For example, I heard that some students don't have classes in Friday. So I think they had better have a part – time job in that time. I enjoy my part – time job. And I experience a lot of important things that I can't be taught in university's classes. So I think it is very important for university student to have a part – time job.
