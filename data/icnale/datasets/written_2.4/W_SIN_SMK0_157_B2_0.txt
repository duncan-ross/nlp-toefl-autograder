The premise behind this statement is completely logical. Smoking not only harms the health of the individual, but the production of second-hand smoke also imposes high negative external costs onto the society. However, detractors of this premise would proclaim that this restricts our freedom of choice and by extension, our individual rights in society. From a restaurant owner point-of-view, the ban would act as a hindrance to his profit-maximising objective as he is unable to tap into a larger clientele base. This is because those who enjoy the pleasures of both food and smoking will seek alternate avenues and may boycott restaurants as a result. In order to negotiate this impasse, smoking should be banned inside all restaurants but, if possible, a separate space should be created for those who desire to smoke. The creation of a smoking zone acts as a compromise between all parties. There is segregation between the non-smoker consumer and the smoker consumer and the former will not experience the detriments of second-hand smoke, hence protecting the welfare of the non-smoker consumer. The smoker consumer is able to exercise his freedom of choice by choosing to smoke, as long as it is within the designated area. As a result, the restaurant owner is able to protect his profit margin as both parties are appeased. However, if one decides to approach this problem on a macro-level, the ban of smoking at all restaurants is not an effective policy. Instead, authorities should work on educating smokers and potential cigarette consumers on the threats smoking pose to them and strive to decrease the number of smokers in society.
