Actually, looking for a job is very hard. Many people do everything to get money for fulfill needed. From children until adults. In fact, now college students spent time to looking for money, they do that a part time job for fulfill they needed. Part time job is the job that do not full time or not like the other worker always do. Usually follower part time job are student of senior high school and college students. Usually they do that after going to school. Many kind of purpose them to have a part time job. First, for experience. Secondly, for fulfill family needed, because that parents cant work. Third, from themselves want have a part time job, etc. I think I agree with above statement because part time job can make the college students have other creativity, college students usually get knowledge just in campus. College student will have more experience. They can help parent's economic and help cost of sister and brother. If college student often to busier it will be become too easy to do work hard. The important they should know choose what the more important to do and do not important less. College student can make more discipline, can't waste the time, because time is important. They can have a lot of new friends from they campus and in the place of part time job. But important thing that they do are drink vitamin and eat healthy food for their work and school affairs are not neglected. Usually the person who did part time is more adult than person who not do that. The parents should protect the children who do the part time job, because they need a spirit from people they love.
