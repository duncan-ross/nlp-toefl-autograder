Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. Smoking is very harmful not only to themselves but to everyone. And it is also very hazardous to the restaurant because it is lighted and it can cause fire. Although I'm not against people from smoking but in public places they should be considerate to the majority who does not smoke. There are young kids, pregnant woman, old people around and smoke is very unhealthy especially to these people. Children are especially curious and it might make them wanting to try smoking. Everyone knows smoking is bad, but they still smoke. Some of the reason being that they see people smoking and therefore can't resist the urge to smoke. If no one smokes in the restaurant, they are not tempted to smoke. Even if they were to smoke in a restaurant with no one else smoking, they will feel being a hindrance to everyone else, and will stop smoking. Smokes from cigarette might trigger the smoke alarm and cause false alarm that the restaurant is on fire. Moreover, smoke particles might land on other diners dish and caused many complicated inconvenience. In other words, smoking must be banned in restaurants as it cause disturbance and inconvenience to restaurant diners. It will also affect the restaurant standards if they allow people to smoke in the restaurant.
