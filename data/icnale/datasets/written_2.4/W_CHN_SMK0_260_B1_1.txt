 In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public places. No mattter what reason you may possess, no matter how willing you are for smoking at that moment you are in the public place, as a result, you can not smoking there. On one hand, smoking in public places is an unmoral behaviour. As we all know, there are usually many people in public places. And I suppose there are lots of people hate somebody who smokes in public places, not only for the places not belong to his or her only, but also for the healthy environment. The smoking activies actully seriously injure the smokers' organs especially for that lung, says the statistics from the WHO, there is more than one third people died in lung cancer simply caused by that smoking. Not only the people who smokes suffer this disease, but also the people who breathe the bad air--the smoke, will face the danger of catching the lung disease. What is more, the smoke coming from the cigarettes is bad for the environment. And it is linked to the greenhouse effect to some degree. We all need a better place to live in, so forbidding smoking in public places is a way of protecting our environment. In the end, I still say that smoking absolutely should be banned in public places without doubt, not only for the smokers' health, but the publics', and to be more, for a more confortable life, a cleaner sky, an enjoyable air. a more beautiful earth.
