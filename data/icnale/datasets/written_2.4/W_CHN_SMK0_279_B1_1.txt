Can you imagine someone smoking just beside you while you are enjoying your pleasant meal with your family or your friends? I guess it might not be comfortable for people. Obviously, we come to a restaurant because we want better food as well as a better eating environment, but smoking in the restaurant certainly is ruining the pleasure. So as far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, from either a personal or a public perspective, it is widely accepted that smoking is ruining our pleasure at the restaurant. In some western restaurants in which smoking is forbidden, the eating environment is much better and people can enjoy both their meal and their conversations better. But things get worse in the restaurants where there are people smoking. There are smokes surround you while you are having your dinner, you will smell a strange smell besides your food and if you are chatting, you and your friends will both feel uncomfortable. More over, the smokes around you are not only taking your happiness away but also damaging your health. It becomes a even bigger problem if you are not the one who is smoking. So, I think smoking should be banned. Apart from the point mentioned above, it might not be neglected that banning smoking is also doing help to restaurants owners. If smoking is forbidden, the restaurants will have a better environment that will attract more customers. Thus, it can increase the restaurants' income the same time it makes people think it is a place worth going again. In conclusion, since banning smoking is advantageous to both the customers and the owners of the restaurants in making the restaurants' environment better, I do strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
