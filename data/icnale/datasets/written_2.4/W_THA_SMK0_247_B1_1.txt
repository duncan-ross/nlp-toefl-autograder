I agree with this statement extremely, because smoking can harm other people who can not smoke. The restaurant is a place to have food, be relaxed, and also get fresh air, so a person who needs to smoke should not go there. I think every country has a rule to stop this behavior, but some people who can not stop smoking could not do it. The restaurant should have the rule about PLEASE DO NOT SMOKE HERE in every corner. Although, there are more people against this rule but it is the rule that every people should strongly do it as normal. The restaurant is a public place where people are willing to go there. If a person who need to have a cigarette he/she should go out of that restaurant and smoke at his/her own house. Smoking is the bad behavior that can cause any problem to the person who smoke and not smoke. Please beware that it is not the medicine to cure your problem when you can not think or do more work at the urgent situation. The smoking people should think a lot how smoking can cause the problem to other person beside you. It might cause other people to dead.
