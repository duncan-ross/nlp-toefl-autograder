I agree with the speech "Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. " Smoking is dangerous for people, because Smoking can make many disease for everyone that breath with smoker For example, lung Cancer. In many restaurant country we can find Smoker living with No-smoker who don't' need smell. In addition to Smoking in a restaurants in country widespread. if No legal can restrict Smoker, people will ill form disease many times. Nowadays, we see that Government legislate ban Advertisement of cigarette. And have post many message on the cigarette pack. For example Smoking will make lung cancer, increase chance of dying many times, danger for pregnant, make bad breath, etc. But the rate of smoking surge because Cigarette Company Advertise by passing indirect way. Nevertheless Government will gain tax of selling cigarette Government should intend to cope with people, we can make many way for example help warn Smoker that "Don't Smoking because you wil danger for me" and Government may increase rate of tax for selling cigarette. This method can reduce many Smokers but, can't total banned cigarette. I think Government should launch the law for Banning Smoking in the restaurants, This is the best way!
