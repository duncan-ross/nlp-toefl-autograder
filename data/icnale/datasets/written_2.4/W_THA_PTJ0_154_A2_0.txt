Today, money is important that people working part-time most popular will be the students who want to earn extra money, because today is rare and is the main factor in everyday life. The cost of living. Studies have cost so much extra revenue for the school by working part time as a cost of purchase. Their own clothes without asking for a constituency of parents, I think that part-time job is to encourage students are encouraged to do. In addition to the payment as an expense but also as a training experience before going to work with the real company so that they know the system to work. Although they have to start to learn the system in the work place again but by working experience when was college students will help them to learn faster than others. Because they already experienced that. They can apply knowledge from school plus knowledge from workplace into their real job so that they can be a good employee who work very quality and may got promotion easily than others because doing job very good. So to have part time job is good to prepare themselves to get ready to do the real work, it is good to do and worth to do so.
