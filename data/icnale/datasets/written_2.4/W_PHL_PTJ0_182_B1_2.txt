What are part time jobs? What is its significance in a society? Is it permanent? Is it helpful to the society? I 'm going to answer these questions that bother me about part time job. In my own idea based on what I learned, part time jobs are jobs which are not permanent but part time only, meaning people who do part time jobs will only work for duration of time and after that they will need to renew their contract or find a new part time job. Carpentry is an example of a part time job where in carpenters can only work up to the contract is finished. The significance of part time jobs is very important especially for those people who can't find a permanent job. Part time jobs are very helpful in a society composed of many skilled workers but lacking in different jobs or occupations. It can be useful for students who lack of money for their tuition because their parents can't sustain their studying needs. It can help for working students because they can earn money from it and continue to study in their desired profession or discipline. Even though it is not permanent, it has a big impact on our society today to have educated people. Even being a working student is hard I think it is worth it especially for those who really need to continue their studies.
