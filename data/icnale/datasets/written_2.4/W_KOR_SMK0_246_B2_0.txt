On the issue whether we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurant or not, I insist that there is no reason to accept this idea. Let me begin by saying that smoking is a personnel habit. All people are to be deserved when it comes to having their habit. Some people argue that smoking should be banned because of the rights of non-smokers. Their main point is smokers should not smoke in the restaurant because non-smokers do not like to be exposed to smoking. Then, how about rights of smokers? Should we assume that the rights of smokers as nothing? By this reason, if we can think alternatives which can preserve the rights both smokers and non-smokers, we should take that way. When we take a deep consideration on this topic, we can find alternatives. For instance, we can divide the space of the restaurant into 2. If we are to separate the space into 2 by using a barrier blocking the air circulate between 2, we can make it happen. Once we finish making this space, we can call the space alternative; one of which is for non-smokers, the other of which is for smokers. So far, we have seen that there is an alternative by constructing the space for both of them. Therefore, there is no reason to deny this ideal which is good for all.
