As a college student, I slightly agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because we are grown up and if we have a part-time job we can spend our time preciously not just only waste it for the useless reasons such as hanging out, shopping, playing games, going to the cinema or over sleeping etc. Having a part time job means that not only you earn some money by your own but also you will learn many interesting experiences from your job and of course, it will be good for our future when we apply for our jobs after we graduated because we have experiences. And for the money that we earn by our own, we will be proud of ourselves. But it is not necessary that all of the college students have to have a part-time job. We can spend our time wisely on our campus life. For instant, studying, doing campus activities, playing sports, arts or music, etc. See that we can get the experiences even we do not have a part-time job and we can spend our time improving our skills, making friends and learn something new etc. To sum up, I think it is good to have a part-time job but it is not a must-do thing.
