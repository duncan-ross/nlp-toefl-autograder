Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I perfectly agree. Today's tuition is so expensive more than you think. The prices are fast increase now. So what should we do? Do we borrow money to parents? It is limitative action. We must earn money ourselves. May be we can't pay school expenses. Cause they're too expensive. But I think we can earn our allowance. A month allowance that one person use is about 30, 0000won. It's a quite a lot of money. And it's also you can get to money from part-time job. Just spend your 5 times than you can get it. Many people say if I have a part time job, I won't have time to myself! yes. It is important to have time to myself. However, you think a little bit differently. If you have a part-time job, you will learn many things. First of all, you know that culture of society. You can learn how to serve the people, and manners. You meet a lot of people. Some are kind, generous, others are rude, no manners. You may be embarrassed to the latter. But it's the chance, you get over the difficulties. So have a part-time job is important.
