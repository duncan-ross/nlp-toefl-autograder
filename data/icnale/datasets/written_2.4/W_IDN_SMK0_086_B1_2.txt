Smoking is unhealthy for our body. Not only for the smokers, but also people who smell the smokes. Smoking causes people becoming addict. Smoking can also kill people slowly. Smoking has been banned in public areas such as toilets, town parks, shopping malls, restaurants, airports and bus terminals. Smoking has been tried by not only adult people, but also teenagers. I agree with the statement which says Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Why? Because restaurants are places that many people come to eat. People do not eat smokes, they eat food. Smokes can cause lung cancer which is a silent killer. Babies can get lung cancer if they smell smokes for a long time. In my opinion, smoking in public areas such as restaurant can cause people angry. The people feel uncomfortable because of smokes. Even the restaurant has ACs to clean the air, the ACs cannot clean smokes. Mostly, smokers do not care people around them. Several restaurants have places for smoking areas but it is not used. The smokers do not use the places to smoke. In conclusion, smoking must be banned before it is too late. Not only causing lung cancer, but also causing people becoming addict.
