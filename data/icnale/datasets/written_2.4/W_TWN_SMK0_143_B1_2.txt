I agree with those anti-smokers that people should not smoke at all; however, we can never forbid people to smoke. As long as cigarettes exist, smokers exist. Restaurant owners have the right to welcome smokers or non-smokers. So, if restaurant owners also hope non-smokers come and consume, they would separate two areas for both sides and make sure non-smoking room reach to smoke-free. On the other hand, the authorities, instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants, they should make law and set rules for all restaurant owners; specifically tell the owners how these two areas separated and what kind of space proportion is legal. For those restaurants that can't fit the standard, they can fine the owners or forbid the restaurants having smoking consumers. If the restaurant owners do not set up two areas for the two groups, then smokers should respect the fact that most people don't like smoke. Studies have shown how damage smoke does to human beings. As a matter of fact, the reason our country banned smoking in every public area, including all the restaurants, because they try to limit free space for smokers. This policy can make smokers feel extremely inconvenient smoking outside, so that those who want to quit may have stronger motivation. However, we have tons of ways to encourage smokers to quit, or we can also use proper law and policy to make both sides breath free. Then what's the need for the government to forbid all the smokers smoking in the restaurants?
