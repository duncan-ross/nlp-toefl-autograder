 Nowadays, more and more college students are used to taking part-time jobs. On this phenomenon, different people have different ideas and there are quite a lot of scientists supporting it. However, as a college student myself, I don't think taking part-time jobs can bring us positive effects. Many people believe that college students have more free time than anyone else, to strengthen themselves, they should take some part-time jobs or even get a real job. But is this true? Why do we go to college, just to find millions of jobs? Obviously, the answer is no. We are students, we come here to acknowledge more useful knowledge, and only in this way could we get a good job in the future. However, part-time jobs often distract students' attention from their studies: some students show a sharp decline in their studies because they don't have enough time and energy to pour into their majors, and few of them even cut classes. Is it good for us? Maybe we take part-time jobs to relieve our parents' burden, but if we cannot find a job after graduation because of the bad exam results, will our parents be happy? So, please don't contact with society too early. To sum up, as a student, we should put our main effort in our studies and try our best to get knowledge, this is our job now. So, please say no to part-time jobs.
