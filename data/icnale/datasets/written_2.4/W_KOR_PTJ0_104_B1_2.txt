To help the youth choose what they are interested in and will ultimately benefits to their jobs in the future, allowing them to work in the real world should be encouraged. Making money on their own in their early age provides educational lessons and merits ranging from gaining confidence, understanding of how market processes, realizing the difficulty of earning money and thus the necessity of saving. Getting paid for what they worked for can be a new kind of rewards of students especially those whose grades are always low. They will think even though they are not good at studying, they can be excellent at other fields being rewarded for what they put their effort. Understanding of hardness of making money and how it comes to them, the youth will learn economy and right consumption.
