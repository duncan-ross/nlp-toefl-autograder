In today's world, a part-time job is starting to become common even before college such as in high school or in some rare cases even before that. This goes to show the kids are getting more responsible overall, and so it would make sense to say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as well. In today's world, the fact that so many young kids have part-time jobs should be a motivation for those that do not to keep up with their peers. Next, college students these days probably have more personal and tuition expenses than those in the generation of our parents, and so we should help our parents out at least in spirit by getting a part-time job to show them that we are investing in our own educations as well. There are also many people who claim that having a part-time job takes valuable time that a student should spend studying away from them. In some ways I agree with this, but I think that most kids today are good enough at multitasking to handle balancing a variety of activities and uses of their time. Things in the world keep getting faster and faster, and if we do not change to keep up with them, we will fall behind.
