Cigarette is one of the things that cause harm to our body. The effect of it is destroy the lung then it normally that will quickly tired. Nowadays, people died because of smoking and majority of them were death from cancer. Most people smoking because of many reasons, some think it cool and some think it good smell, but it cause harmful more than advantage. It is not worth to risk life with the good smell or feel cool in a little period of time. Smoking cigarette is not destroy only smoker but it will destroy people around them too because when smoking the smoke that was spread out in the air cause it poisonous. In addition, people who receive this poisonous air will get harmer more than the one who smoke. It not only destroys the user life but also people all around them. I strongly disagree to allow smoking. Not only in all restaurants but should be all public areas. There should be campaign or policies to stop this bad tradition or behavior. Personally, smoking is not cool at all, and not even gives good smell. On the other hand, it releases very bad smell and destroy the air pollution. People should stop smoking but should do other things which will help the country to keep moving forward.
