I almost agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons that I thought. The first reason is that I think that we cannot completely escape from smoke of tobacco. These days, at the most restaurants, we can choose two area that no smoking area or smoking area. This is called bunen, to divide smoke. However, if we happen to sit a seat near from smoking area, we almost breathe in the smoking area. And at the café restaurant, there are many people who are smoking to relax. But the other people cannot relax. The second reason is that workers cannot be escape from smoke. At a restaurant, workers don't only go to no smoking area, but go to no smoking area and smoking area. This makes workers bad health and I think that I don't want to work such a restaurant. I think the most important problem is that tobacco emit bad chemical substances such as nicotine, tar etc. If tobaccos don't emit bad substances, but only good smell, smoker and the other people can eat meals in one room. So we should invent tobaccos that emit only good smells. This is why I almost agree with the idea about smoking, but if new healthy tobacco is invented, we should introduce it for smoker.
