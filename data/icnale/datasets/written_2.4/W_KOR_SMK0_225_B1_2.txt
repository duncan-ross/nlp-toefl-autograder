There are still remained restaurants which permit smoke in the hall area, but most restaurants are changing. It is not only because of legal issue. As all of us already know, nobody wants to smell it even though they are smokers. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can think about the health at first. Smoking affects not only the smoker but also the people around the smoker, so it is not smoker's own problem. People have their rights to say no in this situation. However, if it is happened in certain restaurant, it can be more seriously. Smelling the smog is not so pleasant for non-smokers or even smokers sometimes. It is very disgusting and can never be welcomed at all. Smokers should know this and they should care others when they smoke. Therefore, it is necessary to make a law to control this problem. Every people should keep their health even though it's indirect one. When smokers smoke, they should care others too. Even if banning smoking in the public area is trend these days, it sometimes happens. We should make the law to keep everyone's health from the damage of smoking. Because of these reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country at least.
