You bet it is. Problem is that there aren't that many part-time jobs to be had where I live. Mind you, it would still be good for the kids who need a few quid. If they can get on the job training, that's great. There are nothing like hands on training to get them ready for a real work. The problem is you see that it's their expectations of what they think they are going to do and what they end up doing that wouldn't always click. If they had some training beforehand then they'd know what it's all about or at least have some idea. Do them good I believe and they could get some basic skills alternatively. That's very important to have too because you've got to know the basics. Some of the working hours might be a bit tricky to fit in with their classes but if they think about it a bit and come up with a plan and follow the plan because you've got to stick to it then they should be fine, no worries at all. Also want to be careful that some of these bosses don't try to take advantage of them you know like using them for slave labour and the like.
