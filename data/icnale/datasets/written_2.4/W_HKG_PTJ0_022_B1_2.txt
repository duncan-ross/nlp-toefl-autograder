There are many opportunities for university students to earn money. Having a part-time job is one of the ways. Although it can help students to earn money real quick, is it really important for university students to get a part-time job? I will say that it's not. There are two reasons underlying my claim. First, university students are supposed to be full-time students so that students should anticipate most of their time in studies and put studying in their highest priority. Thus, the workload is always demanding throughout their studies. However, part-time jobs occupy a lot of time, say 20 to 30 hours a week. Students may not have enough time to finish the work given in their university studies. As a result, they may resort to skip lessons or even copying from the others in order to finish the work. This will adversely affect the students' study behaviour. Therefore, getting part-time jobs is not important, or even it's not good for students. Second, some university students may not get enough experience in working outside. Before working in the real industry, there are some programs that equip university students to be able to work outside such as industrial training, internship program, and so on. These programs provide assistance at all times if you encounter any problems on your work. However, if students do not participate in such programs, they may find it difficult to adapt into part-time jobs since they have to do most of the work by themselves and have full responsibility for their work. They would become stressful as they are struggled to fulfill the requirements in the part-time jobs. Therefore, part-time jobs are not a good way to get working experience and hence it's not important for students.
