College student have a job to study and learn about the subject that they choose in their faculty as a majority. Although, some of them have entrepreneur or high spirit to work so that many college student have a part time job. Part time job that can done by college student, such as a course teacher. They works to help parents or they want to buy something but they don't have money. There are some reasons why they do part time job. They works to help parents because their parents because their parents don't have enough money to full fill whatever they want. When college student have an urgent condition that should be use money. It's really difficult for parents in poor condition. I agree that college student to have a part time job, to full fill their activities or saving money. Not all of the parents in rich condition so that why we as college student must be creative person to solve the problem. After that we can get experience to our future about socialization to other people. Another effect from a worker as a teacher to help us to remember past subject that we learned past. After finish our education, we are struggling to get a job. We are as engineer usually work in an industry or on a factory, we use our attitude, knowledge to get a job which is comfortable with us.
