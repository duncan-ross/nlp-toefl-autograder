I agree this statement. Because restaurant is place where people eat food. Smoker can smoke other place except restaurants. So, smoking in restaurant is should be banned. I don't smoke now sure. And, I won't smoke. Smoking is very bud for our body sure. But, it is good taste for us. So, we can't patient smoke. And, I claim that smoking should be banned in all public places. Sure, people who are smoking have power that they can smoke. But, people who are not smoking have also power that they can avoid bud smoke. Setting boundary line is difficult. All people wished that they want to be comfortable. Smoker must patient their dream that they can smoke everywhere for that. And, smoking is very bud for our body I said again. So, all people should stop smoking. If nothing smoke in the world, everyone is comfortable. But it is only dream. So, smoker should have manner in the least. I and people who are not smoking wish that public place contain restaurants is all banned smoking. It never is that we are all comfortable. But more people is careful, more people is comfortable. We should act for public. We should act for other people
