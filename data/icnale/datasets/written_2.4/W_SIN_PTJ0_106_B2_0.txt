I am of the opinion that while it may be financially beneficial for college students to hold a part-time job, it is not of paramount importance that they should be employed. As a science student, my schedule is usually packed with lectures and tutorials during the semester. What little free time that is available to me will usually be spent with my family and my friends. Having started my final-year project about three months ago, my leisure time has dwindled to a bare minimal, such that even a simple dinner with my family is now a luxury that I hardly get to enjoy. Given the demanding schedule of college students, or at least that of a final-year science student, I feel that it would be difficult for college students to hold a part-time job. A part-time job requires a certain level of commitment and the lack of time is something that makes it extremely difficult for me to hold a part-time job. While the additional income would no doubt come in handy, I feel that the job of a college student is to learn as much as he or she can during the course of study and to channel his or her energy mainly to the pursuit of a degree. This itself may be viewed as a form of commitment. From this perspective, part-time jobs may be viewed as a form of distraction.
