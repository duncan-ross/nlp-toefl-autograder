 I think it is essential that smoking should be banned in public places. My supporting ideas are as followed. First of all, smoking is harmful to our health. The more we smoking, the poorer health we will get. Smoking, in a way, is just like taking drugs. So, the less we smoke, the better we will be. Smoking damages our lung. It adds more possibilities to us to get lung cancer which will finally lead to death. So it's more sensible for us to keep away from cigarettes. Secondly, parents are children's first teacher. If parents become keen on smoking, it will have bad effect on children and their future. They will get more possibility to abandon themselves to smoking when they grown up. Lastly, smoking in public places not only damages your own body, but also destroy other people's who around you. Scientists point out that people who smoke second-hand cigarettes get more chance to get a cancer. So all people's health are under threaten, including those who don't smoke. Why do they have to pay for that? They are innocent and have no responsibility. In order to be fair to all people, smoking should be banned in restaurant. So I think not only in restaurants, smoking should be forbidden in all public places.
