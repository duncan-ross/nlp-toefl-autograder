I think, a past time job is good experience for student because it is knowledge out side a class. This place you can find experience, new friends, new information, wages etc. You can find a place is want some student to do a past time job. A lot of place is can find some student because employer wants students have money and student does not ask money from mother or father. If you do a past time job during study you have a discipline and you will on time but a past time job is not good is you will have enough sleep, enough to learn and you will not be understand in the lesson a result is you will have low grade and it make you feel bad and you are not went to school or university but if you can make it. You are a good student and if you have high grade you are the best everybody is shocked in yourself. I think we are to do a past time job during learning but you must be time management yourself and take care in study very much. As much you can to do past times job during study.
