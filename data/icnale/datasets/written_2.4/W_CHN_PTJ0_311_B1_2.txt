Recently, we had a discussion on whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job in our class. And different students have different views. Some students didn't think it is important. They said that, as a college student, the most important thing is still study, and a part-time job would influence study, doing the job is the things we should do after graduation. But the most students thought that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. They hold the views as follows. Firstly, as a college student, the most important thing is not study, but how to study. The university is different from the senior and middle school. The aim of study has changed. We study not only to get the diploma, but also to gain more knowledge, seize the opportunity to go abroad, or devote oneself to the job better. And a part-time job experience is extremely helpful to your future job. It can help you pass all kinds of face-to-face tests. Secondly, a part-time job can enrich our life. Now, the college students are always staying at university. They spend much of their time to have classes, do their school work, and play computer games. The part-time job is a good thing which is different from what they usually do. Moreover, it can increase their social experience, and they can learn a lot from the employee. As college students who probably will take part in job after graduation. The experience can help them to adapt the work quickly. More importantly, working together with the employees, they can learn how to the actual job and how to get on well with the colleagues. And all of these are very important. All in all, doing a part-time job is very important for college students.
