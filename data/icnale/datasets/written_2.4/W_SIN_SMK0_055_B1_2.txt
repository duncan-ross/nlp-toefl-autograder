Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is a bad habit, it causes many forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. It has also bad effects on the other parts of the body leading to other killer diseases like heart attack and stroke due to clotting arteries and thinning of the arterioles. And COPD at the later stages of life requiring a ventilator to breathe. Resturants are however welcoming this as customers are always right and they would like a place where they can eat and drink without any restictions. They would pay regardless how others sees them. However there are some reasons why the restaurants should ban so as to up their standards. The ash from cigarettes can fly onto someone else food and this causes a commotion where people would not want to visit again. The smoke produced lingers and spoils the next customer's mood as they cannot enjoy the food. Burn marks on tables and chairs means the restaurant needs to change it's furniture frequently and any burning ash could cause a fire and more financial loss to the restaurant. In conclusion, Restaurants should play part by preventing smokers to smoke inside and hope that by doing so it would give a moment of thought for smokers to quit so as to enjoy the time spent with their friends.
