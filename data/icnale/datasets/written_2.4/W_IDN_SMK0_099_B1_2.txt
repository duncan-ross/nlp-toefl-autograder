In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people, especially in the restaurant, it is not good if a meal to inhale cigarette smoke. Besides annoying people who were eating, also can damage the health of yourself and others who breathe it. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette, or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and last but not the least carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. Even the advocates of smoking in public areas disapprove of the practice when it comes to their offsprings. Witnessing the elders smoking kindles similar desire in a youngster thereby giving birth to a new generation of smokers. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy platform for the youth it is not only our duty but need of the day to condemn such practices if not completely then at least socially.
