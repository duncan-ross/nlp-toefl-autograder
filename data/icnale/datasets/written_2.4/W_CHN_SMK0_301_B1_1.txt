 In my eyes, there is no doubt that smoking should be forbidden in public places. Because I think smoking is to public places what a back spot is to a piece of white paper. As we all know, smoking is harmful to the health of not only smoker but also other people around. Public places are used to work, study and entertainment for people. So it should be a good environment and in a good atmosphere. However the smoke form smokers can break the atmosphere so that others cannot work on or study on. When others smell the smoke, they may also want to smoke or not feel well. In a word, the smoke has a bad effect on others in public places. What's worse, sometimes it is very dangerous to smoke in some public places. For example, it is possible that smoking causes fire at a gas station. Smoking in public places reflects smokers' low quality. It will give others a bad impress ion just because there is one people smoking in a public place. In a word, without question, smoking should be forbidden in public places.
