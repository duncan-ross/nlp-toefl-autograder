For College Students, the most important thing is learning, so it is not necessary to have a part-time job, because if the college student has a part-time job, he/she will have less time for learning. Some will argue that part-time job can make one be independent or reliable and can make one get more working experiences. However, college students also can grow up in extracurricular activities, such as contest, camp, meeting, etc. And college students is going to be graduated soon and have to work for all life, which will make the opportunities for learning fewer and fewer, so college students should cherish the time of learning during college time, not focus on part-time job. But, the above-mentioned point is only suitable for those students who do not have to worry about their bread, always getting pocket money from their parents. When it comes to the poor students who have to earn money by self or will not be able to afford the school fees or other expenses, it is important to have a part-time job. However, in this case, the students should not spend too much time on working, ignoring learning. There must be a balance between learning and part-time jobs.
