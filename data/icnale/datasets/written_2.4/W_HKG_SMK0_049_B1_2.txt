Should we ban smoking at all restaurants? No, of course. First of all, we all know that smoking is unhealthy. But why so many people like taking cigarettes? Because they are in addiction. If we ban smoking in everywhere, no people can take cigarettes. The air quality can be improved. Moreover, less students will simulate the others to start taking cigarettes. However, people may forget to consider one fundamental flaw in the argument. Certainly, no one can deny that official forum, there is no conclusive corroboration to support the argument. Most bars are ignore this suggestion. What is more, people disgust this suggestion. This suggest are not effective. Finally, we should consider one alarming adverse effect of the scheme. The government does not allow people to bring more than 19 cigarettes back to Hong Kong. This suggestion will lead the existence of illegal cigarettes are more serious than ever. Also, customer should leave the restaurant when they need to take cigarettes. It is very troublesome. Therefore, we should have second thoughts about the argument smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. This is NOT the best policy. It is beyond dispute that recent debates have aroused much public attention to the matter of the suggestion. Personally, I agree that the idea of smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants brings more harm than good. It is my opinion that the suggestion is a destructive view.
