What is a part time job? It is a job which can be done by everyone with spending less time. The part time job does not give much money. Everyone can do part time jobs. The jobs are used for gaining experience. There are a lot of part time jobs, such as cleaner, office boy, deliver, shopkeeper and so many others. I agree with the statement because finding a real job is hard now. Finding the real job is not easy as we thought because the real job needs specific requirements such as experience and degrees, but the most important is the experience. Experience can be gotten by working. The minimum for experience is a year. Many companies refuse fresh graduated students because of lack experience. To solve the problem, college students should do a part time job. They do the part time jobs when they have time to do the jobs. Mostly, they do not want to take the part time jobs because the jobs are wasting time. They prefer spending time for shopping or watching movie at theater than working. At least, the part time job is important for college students before they take real time jobs. By having part time job, they not only earn money, but also get experience.
