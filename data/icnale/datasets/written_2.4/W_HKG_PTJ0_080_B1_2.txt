I agree that it is important for university students to have a part time job. One of the reasons for that is to broaden their horizons and gain other learning exposure apart from studying. Normally, university students have received 13-15 years of education before they enter the university. New-coming university students might have difficulty to gain access of other learning experience, such as job experience and social communication experience during their studying period in elementary or high school. However, with flexible learning environment in universities, students can take their initiatives to learn and experience apart from academic subjects And having part-time job is one of the ways for undergraduates to equip themselves with other experience. Therefore, in students' point of view, having part-time job is essential to attain all-round development in universities. Not only having part-time job can help students gain other learning exposure, but can help students bridge the gap from purely receiving education to actively participating in the society. The transition of the two phases is seemingly apparent and important with the increase in undergraduates in tertiary education. However, career guidance in high school education curriculum is often neglected because of tight academic schedules. In order to make a successful transition, having part-time job is crucial in the university study path. Through taking part-time jobs, students can find their potentials and working concentrations, which are useful information in preparing the career planning right after the graduation. Hence, it is important for students to take part time job. To conclude, taking part-time job in university study path is important as students can learn other experience and equip themselves with different skills to have all-round development. Besides, part-time job can help students to bridge the social gap so that they can make preparation in career planning in the future.
