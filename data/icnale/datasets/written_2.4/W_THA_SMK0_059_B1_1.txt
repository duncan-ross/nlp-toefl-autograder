Nowadays, many people start smoke more than the past especially in developed countries for example Japan, China and United State. Some people think that it should be banned in public while others disagree with it. On the on hand, some people might think that smoking should be prohibited in public places such as shopping malls, theatres, parks, and night clubs. As a result, smoking gives many disadvantages, for instance healthy problem, social disadvantage, or family disadvantage, not only for smokers but also people near them. Totally, smokers get less toxic from smoking than others near them. So it is the main reason that smoking should be prohibited in public places. On the other hand, some people might think that it will be limited smokers' freedoms under democracy. So it will be against constitution about human rights, if smoking has been banned in public at all. They think it should have some smoking areas for smokers where will not annoyed others in public places and smokers can smoking there. In conclusion, I personally think that it should not be banned in public places at all because it will be limited smokers' freedoms. At the same time, smokers should respect to others' freedoms as others respect theirs.
