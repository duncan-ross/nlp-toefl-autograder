About time I say. If smokers aren't prepared to consider the health of those around them regardless of their own health, then the Japanese Government needs to put their foot down and declare a nation wide restaurant ban on smoking. Fair is fair after all and if smokers want to smoke then that's fine but this business about being free to blow their smoke wherever and whenever they like, has got to stop. It's bad enough that smokers congregate around entrances to buildings and train stations puffing their smoke for all to inhale, without having to put up with it when eating out. It has been proven that smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the world and still, smokers don't seem to care. So why should innocent people have to be put at risk because of smoker's apathy? Governments are in place to serve the people and Japan is no exception and I feel that Japan is obligated to provide adequate legislation to ensure that the innocent people are not put at risk unnecessarily. If left to their own devices, restaurant owners will just side with whomever the most money comes from and do not always have the best interests of their clients at heart.
