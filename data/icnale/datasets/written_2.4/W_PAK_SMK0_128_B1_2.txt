Now a days we see a lot in the newspapers and over the t. v. channels about smoking. Everyone is saying to quit smoking. But no considerable improvement in this regard. And the number of smokers is continuously increasing every year. We need to create more awareness about smoking and warn the people about the unhealthy effects of smoking. The cigarettes contain injurious chemicals like opium, tobacco and nicotine. And these chemicals can cause the diseases like lungs cancer, chronic lungs disease, stroke, coronary heart diseases etc. And due to these diseases every one smoker out of the 5 dies each year. The people in the age range of 20-40 are more toward smoking. Males and female are almost equally involved in smoking when we look at whole world. But here in Pakistan women are less towards smoking as compared to men. Because here the women don't have much freedom as compared to Europe. On each day 1000 kids under the age of 18 will start smoking. And 1800 adults will start smoking each day. Its not all about riches but also the poors which are hardly able to manage their two time meal also waste a lot of money towards this act. In our youngsters smoking is a fashion. And media is promoting this fashion through films. Smoking not only effects the smoker but also the person who is escorting the smoker. These are called second hand smokers and are more liable to disease. Although its difficult to discard an addiction but we have to do this for our lives because nothing is more important than we are. Almost 70 pc people want to quit smoking and 40pc will try to quit but the successful persons will be only 7 pc. So its time to make improvement and to quit smoking to save our next generations.
