There have been lots of arguments about whether college students should have a part-time job in recent days. Different people have different opinions. I share the feeling that it is beneficial for college students to get a part-time or extracurricular job. My thoughts are divided into three points. Firstly, there is no doubt that getting a part-time job can make up our daily fees. Even though our wages are not enough, we can also use what we earned to pay for bills. That is to say, we will be proud enough to announce to our parents that less money is Ok and we have grown up. Secondly, it is really rewarding after seeing our struggles are given such cheerful values in return, which makes up and builds up much confidence and perseverance. Armed with them, we will become braver to face the unpredicted challenges. Enriching our social experience also belongs to the benefits of holding a part-time job. It is universally acknowledged that our society is becoming more and more complicated and filled with heated competitions. Before stepping up to the society, if we own more experiences, we will enter into and adapt to our society quicker and have more chances to manage our future. Of course, doing a part-time job maybe will consume our time. But using a little free time can get enormous benefits, why not take it?
