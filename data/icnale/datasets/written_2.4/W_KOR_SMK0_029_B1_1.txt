Even though some people don't worry about smoking at a public place at all, I think smoking should be absolutely banned at a public place. The biggest reason is that lots of smokers would better stop to smoke at a public place because cigarette smoke causes displeasure for someone at restaurants or other place. Even for me, when I went to school to take a class, I was not very feel good due to smoker's cigarette smoke in daejeon university campus. Besides, I believe smoking is harmful for people who smoke and don't smoke. According to a research, cigarette is not good for people health. We know this fact very well, however many smokers don't stop to smoke on their own. Finally, I personally hope a lot of smokers don't stop to smoke as soon as possible. Moreover, smoking rates increase more and more. Therefore, smoking is quite serious problem in modern society. Also, a lot of smokers don't stop to smoke due to cigarette's toxic. In my opinion, I wish many smokers don't smoke somewhere. I think cigarette is not welcome by nonsmokers somewhere. For these reasons, I believe that it is should be banned to smoke at restaurants.
