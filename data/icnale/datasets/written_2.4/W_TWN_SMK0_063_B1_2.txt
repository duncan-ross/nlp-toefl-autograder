I strongly approve that guests should all be forbidden smoking in restaurants. Because I think via the measure it not only respect the other visitors but also make the restaurant acquire a more comfortable environment. So I definitely agree that smoking should be banned in the restaurants. Although Smoking is a harmful behavior for people, but there still have many people love this behavior. I feel smoking really a bad thing, so I hate smoking. Of course I will not allow persons smoke in a restaurant where I eat. After all restaurants are public places, smoking shouldn't exist in the place. Smokers not only harm themselves but also affect other people that don't smoke. It's really a selfish behavior, and it's also an offensive behavior. I hope related government department must face up the big problem, I think legislators must legislate. Thus we who don't smoke will be even happy in a restaurant or other public places. Meanwhile I also hope those smokers can thrice before they smoke. When they smoke, what do their family and friends think who don't smoke? Now that smoke is generally acknowledged a very bad thing, why don't just try to quit it? Instead of banning smoking in restaurants, smokers can quit smoking. If everyone has more empathy, then I think the world will be wonderful!
