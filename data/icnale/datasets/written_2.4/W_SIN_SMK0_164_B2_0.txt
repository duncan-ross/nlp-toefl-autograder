I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, breathing in second hand smoke while eating results in a bad dining experience. The smell of smoke is a major distraction for most people as it not only affects the taste of our food, but also prevents us from enjoying conversations with friends over a meal. Secondly, smoking is bad for our health. It causes lung problems and scientific evidence has proven that second hand smoke have more harmful effects than being a direct smoker. Thus, smoking should be banned at restaurants to protect the health of others. In addition, the ban can protect the health of the employees of restaurants. Many of the waiters and waitresses have no choice but to work in such conditions. Long term exposure to second hand smoke will have dire consequences on their health. Thirdly, the ban will encourage people to quit smoking. People will not be able to smoke while eating and this will help curb their addiction especially in the long term. In conclusion, while the ban may result in a drop in profits for restaurants, I believe that the benefits of the ban outweigh the cons.
