 It is not compulsory for college students to take a part-time job but I think if possible, the school should encourages its students to actively search for internship opportunities and prepare themselves for their career. It is true that study is the basic task of a college student, but there is certain knowledge and skills that can only be learned better through the real working experiences. All these skills will prepare the students better for their future career. If the part-time job is related to the field of study of the students, then the hands-on experience will reinforce the knowledge learned in the textbook. So with proper time management, the college students should be encouraged to take a part-time job. However, the scope and time requirement of the part-time job have to be taken into consideration when the students choose their part-time jobs. The purpose of doing part-time job is to help students gain working experience; if by doing part-time job, students are not able to manage their academy well, then doing part-time job perhaps is not the best choice for the students at this moment. It is best that the college supports this working scheme by actively sourcing suitable employers and companies to provide jobs for students. Not only the students will gain from the working experience, the school would also be more socially involved as an education institution.
