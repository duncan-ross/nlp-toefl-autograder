I always heard this word spoken by older friend. And I think part time job is a positive activity for youth. We do job on free time, give more benefit than just sleep or maybe playing game. We can have fun, meet a lot of people, do social activity and give more challenge. And the special thing is, we can get some money. I am a college student as a polytechnic student. In my opinion part time job is a not best choice because we study in full day time. But I agree that do a part time job is a best way to spend our time. We can choose part time job depend on our hobby, for example. If we interest with music, we can choose job basic on music, like music shop keeper, or maybe we can be a lecture for music school, that's so interest isn't it ? We must aware that part time job can disturb our main activity. Our parent give us a priority to study. So make them proud with our study result, part time job is side act. In a big city like Surabaya, where I live now as a women we must more careful and more selective. We must choose the best one, depending on our free time, work job, situation and payment that we get. Remember, our basic activity is study. So be smart gals to choice right way to your live.
