 As we all know, there is a normal phenomenon that customers smoke in the restaurants. Some people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because smoking in restaurants has the bad effect on environment and people's health. Others believe smoking can be allowed in some special situation. Personally, I agree with the former opinion. The main reasons lie in the following facts. On the one hand, smoking in restaurants has influence in the environment. Restaurant is a place where people have meals and rest. If a lot of customers smoke in restaurants, there will be air pollution. Others who do not smoke will have a bad mood when they are eating. On the other hand, smoking in restaurants is harmful to people's health. It is obvious that when people are smoking they can absorb the polluted air. Because of this reason, people will get different diseases, such as cancer. People cannot survive longer time. So smoking in restaurants poses a great threat on people's health. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country so as to avoid the downside. And I think everyone should take responsibility for themselves.
