I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is a chance for us to find what we really want in our life. Although the money is important, but the precious things in part-time job are the lessons we get in the working period. For me, I will choose a part-time job which not only provide a chance to make money but also provide an experience in my college life. Through the experiences, we can prove that we have the ability to earn money by our own, learn how to socialize with people, get out off our little world, look deeply inside what the real world is and listen to the sound in our hearts. Finally, knowing the real self, and talk to ourselves and face it. Finding the things which we want to do in the future. Maybe through the part-time job experience, we will know the way which we should go in the next step of our life-keeping study, working, creating things or just go for a trip to feel the big world. The value of the part-time job is not only the money we get but also the thing we go through.
