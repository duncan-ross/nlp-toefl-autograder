Traditionally, university student will most often focus on their study first before turning to other activities to fill up the time. Lately, more and more students are eager to have a part-time job as soon as they made it into college. This, to certain extent, will affect their academic records which is a huge issues for the students. So, should university students take any part time jobs? First of all, university is the final step before you make your jump into the society. And in the society, academic excellence will only contribute a tiny bit to your chance of getting a prospective job. With so many applicants fulfilling this criteria, your ability to show other attributes will provide a significant edge over the other candidates. One of those qualities should be previous working experience. After all, education is only theoretical modeled, but when you are asked to showcase your knowledge through solving daily problems or completing relevant tasks, it is an entirely different matter. Also, when you have worked before, the time needed to adapt will be much fewer than novice. Secondly, some of the students' family may not be that well off, so the students will need to support themselves. And there doesn't seem to a lot of means on offer to fund your study than getting a part time job. So, getting a part time job will be critical here. Whether or not it's for experience or money, I would say university students should be allowed to have part time job.
