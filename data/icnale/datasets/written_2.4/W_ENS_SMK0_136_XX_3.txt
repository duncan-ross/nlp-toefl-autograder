Most reasonable people would agree just as I do. I know that any non-smoker who has ever been in a restaurant, enjoying their meal when suddenly, just as they were about to eat a mouthful of food, got a face full of smoke instead, would also agree. This is one of the most common complaints received by restaurant owners from their non-smoking patrons. Yes, we all know about individual rights to smoke and not smoke, at least as consenting adults anyway. How about the rights of others though, like say, thousands of non-smokers who like to dine out? While I have never heard of anybody dying because of not smoking, I have most certainly heard of many deaths and illnesses related to smoking. In itself, that should be enough reason for Japan to ban smoking in restaurants and all public places without argument or debate. Yes, we know that Japan has a nation full of chain smokers and so I say, so what? If smokers can't take care of themselves then the least the Japanese Government can do or for that matter, any government is to minimize the danger to others. Stand up and be counted and lead the way, regardless of how high the vote count is for smokers and against non-smokers or vice versa. Do it for the good of the people or for one of the very reasons that all taxpayers pay governments for and that is to protect the citizens.
