As we all know that when we went to the university, we college students have more free time. Shall we have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. On the one hand, part-time job gives us more opportunity to understand the society. The reason why we stay in the school is that we are preparing for the job in the future. The experiences we gain from the part-time job will become our priceless wealth. When me ask a job, the interviewer usually ask us whether have experience. Without experience, we still cannot be able to take over a job successfully. On another hand, part-time job helps us become more independent. Sooner or later, we will depend on ourselves when our parents past away. During the period of part-time job, we will know how hard it is to make money. In addition, we can widen the sight and make friends with others. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden our horizon of mind and make our life more meaningful. In general, as a college student, we should try our best to have a part-time job. You should know that when you have a part-time job, you can obtain many things which can not gain from the school.
