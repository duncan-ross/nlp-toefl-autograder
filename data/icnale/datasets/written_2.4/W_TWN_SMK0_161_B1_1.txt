Once you smoke, you might not get rid of this bad habbit. Through smoking more and more, the risk of suffering from cancer is getting larger and larger. Some researchs tell us that smoking is one of the reasons of dead. For pregnants, smoking can not only affect their own body but also damage their babys. Beside damage smokers' own health, the most suffering are those who are near them. Think of this situation, one day you go to a restaurant and have a delicious meal. Everything seems wonderful for you. However, people who beside your site is smoking. How does the meal taste?The smells of cigarette is awful to many people. So I strongly agree that restaurant must be smoke-free. The authority of concerned should do the best to ban smoking at the restaurants. By the way, I think that maybe there could be some specific regions in the restaurants or other sides where people can smoke. For smokers, it is also their duty that they should try their best to quit smoking. After all, it is not a good behavior to have a cigarette and affect other people's health.
