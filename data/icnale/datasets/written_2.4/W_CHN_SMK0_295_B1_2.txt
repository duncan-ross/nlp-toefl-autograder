Smoking has long been considered to be bad to our health while still there are so many people who can not get rid of it. What's worse, people around the smoker will suffer. So I do approve of the policy that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is our common sense that smoking shortens our longevity. Any one who wants to live happily and healthily in his older ages needs to stop smoking. Banning it in public places warns smokers of cigarettes' health-damaging effects and gives them less chances of smoking. And it ensures them a healthier life. Better still, non-smokers in restaurants can get a relief from the worry that there would be a heavy smoker fill the air with bad-smelling, health-affecting smoke. They will surely have a better time eating in the restaurants. Restaurant owners benefit from the policy too. No smoker there always means less conflict between customers. It also makes restaurants a more welcome place. Cleaning is much more easier when they do not have to deal with the smoke, cigarette ash and snipes. So it is a win-win game for smokers and non-smoker, customers and restaurants. Why not implement this useful policy to our society as soon as possible?
