Smoking should not be banned in restaurants in a country. It is very difficult to ban smoking especially in Indonesia where the most income come from cigarette's taxes. Smoking has become a habit for people. Since it is impossible to ban smoking in restaurants, I will propose an alternative solution for overcoming smoking. First of all, the government can make the law of providing smoking rooms. Restaurants must provide smoking rooms for the smokers. This is important for both the customers and the restaurants. The customers who want a free smoking area will not be disturbed by the smokers and the smoke of the cigarettes itself. It also helps reducing the number of passive smokers. on the side of the restaurants, the customer will still enjoy the service and will not be annoyed also. Thus, it will bring advantages for the customers and the restaurants. Secondly, the government may increase the taxes got from the cigarette companies. By increasing the taxes, the government will have more money to provide smoking rooms in public places. For example, in smoking rooms can be built in the pedestrian area. People are not allowed to smoke in open air, so the government must provide smoking rooms built with the money they get from the taxes. It is the responsibility of the government. Finally, the government can also do seminars of smoking. As I said before, it is impossible to stop people from smoking. However, we can still save our next generation by reminding them that smoking is unhealthy. As a form of reminder, government can conduct conferences or seminars related to the bad effects of smoking. The target of this event is not only children and teenagers. Working people, parents, and even smokers can still be persuaded to avoid and stop smoking.
