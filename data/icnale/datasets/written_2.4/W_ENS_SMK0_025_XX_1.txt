Again, although I think that banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would be good for the health of the Japanese and be an act of goodwill to the nonsmokers, I will take the opposite position and explain why it banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan may have some unintended consequences. First, people should be free to do what they want and not have to worry about if other people are mad at them for doing something they love. Next, for many smokers, having a cigarette after a meal is very satisfying and enhances the experience they have in the restaurant. Also, they can select their cigarettes to complement the tastes of the meal and have a truly gourmet experience. Finally, many restaurants already have nonsmoking areas and smoking areas which can separate nonsmokers from smokers so that both groups are happy and neither group pass to worry about the other. This is really the best solution because it keeps everyone happy and allows everyone to do exactly what they want to do without making any rules that would negatively affect one group. Therefore, there are some reasons why banning smoking at the restaurants in Japan would be a bad idea.
