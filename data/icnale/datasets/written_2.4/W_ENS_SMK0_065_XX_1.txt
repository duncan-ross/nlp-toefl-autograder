I don't think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I also don't think that smoking should be banned all the restaurants in the U. S., but it is becoming increasingly common to see United States restaurants ban smoking. This is not fair to the smokers who would like to enjoy themselves just as much as the nonsmokers. The best way to solve this problem is simply to have a smoking section and a nonsmoking section in every restaurant. This is very easy to accomplish and should not cost the restaurants too much money to put into place. If they can do this, both smokers and non-smokers can have a good time at any restaurants and not have to worry about the other people. Smokers are inconvenienced just as much by not being able to smoke in restaurants as nonsmokers feel they are when smokers smoke in restaurants. Just like everything, there is a balance to be found, and it will not be acceptable to simply go with the opinion of one group for the other. In today's world, it is necessary to take in the opinions of everybody and find solutions that adequately address everyone's concerns.
