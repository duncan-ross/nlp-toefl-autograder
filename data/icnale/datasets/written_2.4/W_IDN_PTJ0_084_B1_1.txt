I agree with this statement, this is one of good choice for student with low economy, because it can help his income, his school fee or daily necesssary. But i think it is not only for low economic student, but also suitable for every student. They can practice how they can feel real of work before they take a part in work society. Based on the reason above, if they want to take a part time job, it is important consider for them to balance between campus activity and part time job. If we can divide between campus activity and part time of job well, so the result will be good. I will give some example for job part time. First, almost of student who take a part time of job is teaching, or private course, it is not heavy but we have to consider it well, for example, we just take a part in spent time, which has 1, 5 hour in one meeting, so it is not too heavy. Beside of it, we can learn from the content. The second example, we can join in shopping centre, surely it is not too heavy to ourself, for example we can become a waitress or shop officer. Finally, if we take a part real at work next time, we will have a confidence, because we feel how become a worker. We can share/work in group well.
