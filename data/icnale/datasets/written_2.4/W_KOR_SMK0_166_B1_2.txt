Although I am not a smoker myself, I understand that many smokers feel we have gone too far in restricting their right to enjoy tobacco. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. First, Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. But Passive smokers do choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public. Second, in many places, there are no non-smoking restaurants. These days It's banned in Korea, in restaurants, pubs and inside in all public places, that more than enough, banning it outside is going way too far. However All people have rights, and we cannot limit them. Because smoking is the own choice of every man, it would be very intolerant behavior if people against smoking will limit them. But there is some decision in such hard situation. In restaurants it should be smoking parts, where smokers can smoke and do not disturb others. Its good way for all people. In summary, smokers may know well that their smoking in public places and restaurants leads to a flood of complaints from nonsmokers. Everyone has the right to be safe and healthy in their restaurants, but this basic right can be infringed by smoking. Because of these, smokers must accept the fact that they do not have the right to pollute the air other people inhale, and that restrictions must be placed on their right to smoke
