I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Personally, I have a great dislike for the smell of smoke. However, even if we look at this issue objectively, it has many reasons to why it should be completely banned. Firstly, the harm of taking in second-hand smoke by unwilling non-smoker is the main reason. Taking in second hand smoke harms the lung of people who are not willing and yet are suffering it. Besides the health issue, the environment that customers wish to enjoy while dining will be destroyed as well. No customer who is a non-smoker will like to bear the "smoky" environment. Furthermore, they are paying for it as a customer. Secondly, being a restaurant, it will be an enclosed area which smoking will result an environment that will be not enjoyable for customer. This is unlike coffee shop which is open area and a smoker's corner can be designated smoker. Even though some restaurants have open areas, I will like to discourage designating a smoker's corner because this method may not be very useful. This is because there is still a possibility that the smoke generated from smoking can enter the enclosed dinning area.
