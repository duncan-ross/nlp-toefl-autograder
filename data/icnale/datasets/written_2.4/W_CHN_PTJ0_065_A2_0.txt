Nowadays, a growing number of college students have part-time jobs. In my perspective, college students have part-time job is necessary. Firstly, college students usually have much free time. So they have opportunities to use that time to do work such as part-time jobs and so on. Then college students have a lot of theoretical knowledge. But they usually are lacking of practicing experience. And having part-time jobs can solve this problem. Secondly, having part-time jobs can let college students make some money. About this money college students can afford a part of their school fee. And they also could buy something they like. Furthermore, it will help them find a job after graduation for college students. Many employers like student mature and have many experiences. Having a part-time job can give you experience and skills. Finally, at present, most of college students are the only child in their families. So it is necessary to let them know the stress about making a living in our society. It is time for college students to know the difficulty of working and making money. So they thank their parents more. In conclusion, as college students, having part-time jobs will bring big revolution for them. I think college students should find a part-time job.
