Smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. I think that rule is good for many people because smoking can make other people sick and the smoking is not good for our body. Now in many restaurant the smokers already banned because they smoke not good to another people. The smoker can smoke but only in the special room and not in public room because that can make people sick and not enjoy the food they buy. Smoking should be banned not only in restaurant but also banned in public facilities such as airport, railway station so all the people can enjoy the public facility without smoke and we help to save the world in to green concept. In another side smoking it's not good for a body because smoking have a lot of poison that can make our body sick. Smoking is linked to lung cancer, heart disease and other diseases. Besides, smoking kills many people every year. So I have to recommend the smoker must be stop smoking in restaurants and all public places or if they want to smoke they can go to smoking room because in that room the smoke and the poison has been naturalize to good air and they will not disturb other people.
