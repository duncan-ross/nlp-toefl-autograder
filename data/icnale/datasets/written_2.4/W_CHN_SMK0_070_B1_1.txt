There is no doubt that the restaurant is one of the most popular public places where smokers are used to smoke. We can notice that most of our Chinese restaurants have smoking smell. Smokers may not mention it, but people who don't smoke think it is disgusting and have no appetite for eating. Allowing for this, I partly support that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. Many reasons could support it. When we are eating, the smoking can easily get into our lungs through our mouths. It is harmful for our lungs. That is to say people who do not smoke can be affected too. That is the reason why we always say smokers also destroy others' lungs when they are smoking. There are still some important reasons. When adults are smoking in restaurants, children would remember this act and imitate it. That means the restaurant is also a place where grows the population of smokers. On the other hand, smokers smoke after meal could damage their digest system and other organs. In summary, smoking is bad for our health, especially during or after meal. I think the government had better to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
