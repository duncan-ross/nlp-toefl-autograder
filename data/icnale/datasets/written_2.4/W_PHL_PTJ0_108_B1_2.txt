Life nowadays is like hunger games – no pain, no gain. Everyone needs to work in order to survive. though some of the teenagers are still depending on their parents, time will come that they need to work, they really need. No matter how rich or poor they are, having a job is essential for averybody especially now that money makes the world go round. Almost every college student's goals are to graduate and to have the job that he deserves. But this does not apply to all. Some college students are doing dove-tailing—students in morning and workers in evening or vice versa. They are doing this to have an extra allowance, to help their family financially and to gain an early experience for their future career. As we consider their everyday life, it is difficult and very stressful but as we look at their reasons for doing this, we may consider them as heroes. I believe that these students/workers are risk-takers. Many things may be sacrificed because of this kind of living. One of those is their social life. Instead of having fun every Friday night, they are in a busy place—working. Also, their family bonding may be lessen. Instead of playing with their siblings or helping their parents in household chores, they are in a busy place—working. At the end of the day, if we think positively, having a part-time job will be an advantage for college students when they are going to apply for their future career.
