I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students often have schedules that afford them a few spare hours every day. Assuming a student has five hours of lessons every day, this leaves a large part of the late afternoon and evening free for them to work part-time. By working, students enable themselves to earn an income to sustain themselves, so they do not have to depend on handouts from their parents. Apart from cultivating their independence, a part-time job might possibly also allow students to have disposable income. If a student is prudent with the extra money that comes from a part-time job, he or she can finance overseas trips or plough this sum of money into investments. Furthermore, students ensure that their time is nicely occupied. Working provides them with the impetus to take stock of their time properly. After all, when a student knows that he/she still has assignments to hand in and projects to complete after his/her work, there is less chance of him/her slacking off on his/her academic commitments. More importantly, part-time work provides a student with life experience--- something that is not easily attainable from merely reading books. The interactions that students glean from their work experience will stand them in good stead when it is time for them to enter the workforce as fulltime employees. While a part-time job might lead to less personal time for a college student, this need not be a bad thing altogether. By managing their time wisely, having a part-time job for college students need not be an onerous commitment. Indeed, many college students around the world can attest to the fact that part-time work can have financial and socio-emotional benefits.
