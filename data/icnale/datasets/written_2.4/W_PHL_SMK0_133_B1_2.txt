WE ARE HUMAN HAVING THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE DOING GOOD? ARE YOU AWARE IN DIFFERENT RULES AND REGULATIONS, ARE YOU SURE YOU FOLLOW IT CORRECTLY? WE ARE HUMAN USING OUR SENSES WE CAN KNOW IF WE ARE DOING CORRECT OR NOT, AND THIS IS THE TOPIC: SMOKING SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BANNED AT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY, I AM DISAGREE, WHY? WE CANNOT PLEASE ALL PEOPLE TO STOP SMOKING IN JUST WINK OF OUR EYES IT TAKES TIME TO FOLLOW THE RULES, THE LEADER AND OFFICIALS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRY MUST SETTLE GOOD RULES AND REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT ALSO TO THE RICH ONES. THE GOVERNMENT MUST TREAT THEIR PEOPLE EQUALLY SO PEOPLE WILL OBEY THEM ALSO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY RESPECT THE DIGNITY EACH OF US. WE ARE HUMAN, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMMIT SINS AND MISTAKES AND WE CANNOT TURN THE NEXT DAY WITH PURITY IN OUR SOUL AND BODY, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK YOURSELF YOU DOn't COMMITTED ANY SINS AND MISTAKES WITHIN THE SPECIFIC DAY MAYBE YOU DOn't HAVE ANY REASONS TO STAY ON EARTH AND MISSIONS IN LIFE, IN SHORT YOU ARE DEATH.
