As we all know, other people are not fortunate enough to sustain their everyday needs. Surviving everyday is tough, we humans really need to work hard in order to live another day in this modern world. We would do anything necessarily to live. As I have said, not all of us are fortunate, we do not have the same statuses in life. Other people need to work twice as hard. Some people who had no other options resorted in committing crimes. That's the real world, life is not easy as we thought about when we were still kids. Obviously, people do jobs to earn money to sustain their own everyday needs. These people may be of different statuses, some, work to sustain their own personal needs. Some are students who need money to go to school. They do part time jobs at different places. Their working hours depend on their schedule in class. These students work also to help their parents in supporting their education. By doing part time jobs, they could lessen the financial allotment of their parents in sending them to school. Maybe this is their way of showing gratitude to their parents. Others are doing part time to make their spare time productive, in a way that they would earn and gain experience at the same time. Part time job has a lot of benefits. Aside from earning money to sustain ourselves, it could also be a way to gain working experience, which would be of use in the future. Today, especially in Architecture, students must attain a two- year field experience in order to take the board exam. Doing part time jobs could be of great help to us students, in this way, we could help our parents and the same time, our own selves.
