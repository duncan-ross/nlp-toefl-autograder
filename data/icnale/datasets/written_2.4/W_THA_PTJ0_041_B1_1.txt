I think that it is so good to have part time job while being a student because college students were experienced from their works. We learn about the system in the organizations. So when we grow up we can apply the experience in our organization. To make friends, and deal with difficult situations, are things we can get from part time job also. We can practice language if we work in restaurants, fast food, brand name shop, foreign organizations. Some friends are rich from working part time job. Nowadays, SME, MLM are very popular, some of people who have this part time job, they don't work but try to find more net work and sell products. Someone may don't like it but I think it's better than doing something illegal. But I don't work, I can't manage time. I have to focus on my study only because if I have a good grade I can have a good job. Also, there are too many books that I have to read, some time I can't read all of them but because no time for that. I want to work some day, but I think if we chose to work part time job, we should handle the study. Study is the first thing our family want us to do and then have to find job. Going step by step may be good for someone. But if you think you have to work, you have to care study too.
