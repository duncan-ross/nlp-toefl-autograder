No one but longs to be a strong and healthy man. So when asked about whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. I partly agree with this idea and think that we can do something to solve the problem because of the reasons listed below. Firstly, a factor should be taken into consideration is that there are so many people crowded together in restaurants; a terrible smell from the cigarette may pollute the air in the restaurant. People who hate smoking have no way to go if they have their dinners in the restaurant when other people smoke. It is unfair for them. Second, we should emphasize the importance of health. Second hand smoking also can have a terrible influence on our body. It may do harm to our immune system. If we have meal in a room full of smoke for long, we may have some health problems too. Viewing from the two reasons above, the runner of the restaurant can form a smoking room for the smokers. The smoking room is separated from the main restaurant. On the one hand, the room can meet the smokers taste. On the other hand, fresh air is guaranteed in the restaurant. A healthier place is provided to the customer.
