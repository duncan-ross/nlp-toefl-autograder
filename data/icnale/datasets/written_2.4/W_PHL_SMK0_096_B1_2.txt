Smoking became a part of humanity, but what does it really do and how does it really benefit or destroys one's life? According to many researchers, smoking doesn't have any benefits in the health of a human. But according to smokers, smoking help them pass through their problems and help them psychologically. In my perspective, smoking is just a tool in destroying one's health, life and planet. One of my uncles, who are a heavy smoker, said that smoking just makes you cool and that is the most absurd thing I heard about smoking in my whole life. He is just addicted to it and he doesn't want to admit it. His body became more vulnerable to sickness, his lips are becoming black, and the worst is the smell of his breath. One time we had some kind of family reunion and we ate in a restaurant. I always enjoy the food in there because it is very delicious and the atmosphere was very comfortable and refreshing until my uncle's smoking habit ruined everything and that's when I realize that smoking isn't banned in that restaurant. My uncle's seat is just right in front of me and every time he smokes, I smelled it and almost taste it while eating. It was the worst experience that I had on eating in that restaurant. Smoking should be banned at the restaurant in the entire country because the smoke could go to other people's lungs while eating and that would be really dangerous to one's health.
