I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Completely seems to indicate the idea of ultimatum which in itself, appears to be too extremist. While smoking is a behaviour that we do not wish to promote as it is detrimental to the health of the smoker and to the people who inhale the smoke and that it is ideal that all places be smoke free, it appears that banning it completely goes against a human's basic rights to smoke. It is an individual's choice and decision to want to smoke and by banning it all, we are imposing a restriction to that choice. Hence, I believe in the freedom of rights. On the other hand, we all have the right to enjoy a smoke free environment. Thus, I argue that smoking should be banned selectively in all restaurants. This means that there should be smoke free areas in the restaurants and areas where smoking is allowed. This way, people can still enjoy a smoke free environment without imposing on the rights of smokers. This is also the current policy in Singapore. While we restrict certain areas from the behaviour of smoking, we do not completely ban smoking. Hence, I disagree to a large extent that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
