During their teenage years, students often find jobs to pass the time during the holidays or for some quick spending money. Others find jobs to supplement their allowance, according them financial freedom to buy into frivolous fads that define the teenage experience. However once college rolls around, I would argue that a part-time job is not only important, it comes highly recommended as an induction into the working world, which they will soon find themselves having to contend with. At this point, I would like to make the distinction between the part-time jobs of teenage-hood and college part time jobs. While the former usually comprises waiting tables or manning a small store, the latter refers to an internship, part-time, or freelance position related to the student's field of study. Perhaps the most critical take away from a college part time job is not the technical knowledge, but the character development comes with a first foray into their chosen industry. While college may provide ample room for idealism and creativity to blossom, it is the pressures of the working world that places students in difficult, uncomfortable or stressful situations. It is through these situations that students are forced to grow and mature rapidly, learning and adapting to a given situation with social skills that will be honed and sharpened as he learns to navigate the minefield of a real-world working environment. When the student returns from a period in the field, his naivete will be tempered with realism; he will bring with him a greater appreciation for employers and subordinates alike. These are the lessons a college degree cannot teach, and they make a part time college job both crucial and worthwhile.
