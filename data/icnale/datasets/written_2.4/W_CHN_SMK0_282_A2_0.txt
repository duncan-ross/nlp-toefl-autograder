As we all know, smoking is a bad habit that is not only harmful to the smoker's health, but also ruins others' appetite around the smoker. So nowadays smoking in public place such as restaurant, bus, store has become a health concern in society. And some cities like Shanghai has made a rule that forbid smoking in public place. And I think this is a wise measure that government should take. Smoking in public place, I think, is impolite behavior. The people around the smoker may feel uncomfortable because they have to smell the smoke all the time. And in a crowded bus or train, some people even may feel dizzy just because someone is smoking around them. So smoker who smokes in public place do not respect the others around him. Smoking can do harm to our health, not only to the smoker himself, but also to the people around him. Nicotine, which the cigarettes contain, can damage our lungs, and then causes some lung diseases, even lung cancer. Now many researches have found that the smokers are much more likely to get lung cancer than those who do not smoke. And the people who usually stay with smokers may risk having lung diseases. So I think forbidding smoking in public place is necessary. Besides, smoking in public space may also have a bad effect on a city's appearance. If in one city, you see many smokers in the streets, restaurants and parks, you may feel that the air of this city is so dirty and it will make people not willing to stay there. Therefore, a beautiful and comfortable city should forbid smoking in public place. This can not only prevent us from every kind of lung diseases, but also make our life better.
