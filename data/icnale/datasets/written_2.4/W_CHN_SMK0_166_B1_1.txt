Should smoking be banned in all public places? I think it is a very serious problem during the smokers. Some support the policy, some against the policy. It is hard to decide which is right or wrong. In my mind, I support the point to ban the smoking in all public place, like restaurants, bus station, and so on. Not for others, but also for the smokers. Various modern researches show that smoking is very harmful to smoker. Smoking causes various diseases for example, when smoking much oxygen is used and less oxygen come to the brain, lungs and heart. This is very dangerous to young people. People should have a good health to do everything. Without a health body, person cannot do something that you like to do. Smoking also has great influence on family. As you know, smoking cost a lot of money. So smoking is not a lightly economic burden. And more terrible things are that smoking will damage DNA, which will change family from physiology and smoking cannot be stopped easily like drugs. According above statements, smoking should be banned because smoking is harmful to health, bad influence on family. Banned smoke can bring us comfortable living environment. Only a comfortable environment, people can live a happy live. So I support the idea to ban the smoking on public.
