Money to spend is a concern for many college students nowadays. This situation has been around since the start of my college life, moreover it has been a shared issue among my peers. There are reasons for college students, just like my friends and I, who are worrying about the money problems. Majority of us felt that are our entertainment lifestyle is the most influential factors to the reason why we need part-time job. There had been many marketing news out in the society to lure students like us buying goods and services. For example, college student getting the latest phone, such as Samsung note, LTE in the market would make you the most "fashionable" guy around. In fact, there are many more things to keep us entertained during our free time. For instance, watching movies and going to places like shopping district and theme park to enjoy various attractions. All of these activities have its cost and it is rather not that cheap to sustain. Therefore, our lifestyles would determine how much money we need and this translated to securing a part-time job to earn that spending-power ability. Nevertheless, it is important for college students who have higher demand for quality entertainment lifestyle to have a stable income. And this could means having our parents to support us or taking up part-time job to sustain our desires. Every collage students has to manage their spending, if there is insufficient money for their lifestyle, and then the needs for part- time job to earn that extra money will be inevitable for them to take.
