It is undeniable that smoking is measurably damaging and addictive. Smoking has been directly linked to lung cancer, making it a particularly deadly element. In addition, secondhand smoke inhaled by nonsmokers has been linked to significant respiratory ailments. This results in the smoker presenting not only a hazard to him or herself, but to those nearby as well. The danger smokers pose to those nonsmokers around them has prompted many governments to ban smoking in public places. Many municipal governments in Japan impose fines for those smoking outside of designated smoking areas such as the large smoking area in front of the east exit of Shinjuku. Smoking while walking, known in Japanese as "aruki-tabako" (walking-tobacco), is particularly of note, as it not only makes nonsmokers nearby uncomfortable, but also exposes them to secondhand smoke. As such, governments across the world have either enacted or are considering complete smoking bans inside enclosed spaces, including bars and restaurants. The reasoning is very clear; even with smoking and nonsmoking sections, nonsmoking patrons are exposed to secondhand smoke. The rights of smokers do not extend to allowing them to cause physical damage to nonsmokers. In this, I agree wholeheartedly. As a smoker, I do not have that right. However, my opinion shifts slightly when it comes to bars. The culture of many bars is that of a beer in one hand and a cigarette in another. It is simply the truth that smoking in many circles is considered cool or sexy. Banning smoking in bars would lead to a diminished bar culture, and reduced income for bar owners. Even if smoking were allowed on verandas, space limitations in places like Tokyo would lead to difficulties in compliance. However, in full-service restaurants, smoking bans should be strongly considered.
