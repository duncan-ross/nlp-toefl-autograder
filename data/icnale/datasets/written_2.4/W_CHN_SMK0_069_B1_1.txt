At the moment, many cities around world ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The new ban causes an intense debate among people. Some people especially the smoker protest the ban very much. They said that smoking is their own business, the ban influence their private right. They should smoke is their choice. Many smokers think smoke after dinner is very happy. So they don't like to stop smoke in the restaurants. Other people support the ban. They think that smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also harm to the other people around them. People want to have a clean place in the restaurant. They hate smell of smoke. Smoke will harm their health if sit very close to the smokers. From my perspective, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. As we all know, there are many poisonous things in cigarettes. Many people find that these things can cause cancer and some other illnesses. When someone smoking it the restaurant, the people around them breathe the poisonous gas too, it can also cause cancer. It is true that smoking is people's own business, but they don't have the right to have effect on other people's health. In short, I support the ban for people's health.
