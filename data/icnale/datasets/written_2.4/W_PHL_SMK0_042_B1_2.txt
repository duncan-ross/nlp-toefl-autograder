A Minute of Heaven and an Hour of Hell The health problem brought by smoking is not a new issue for the most of us. We were flooded with news and reports dealing with the harmful effects of the use of cigarettes. Also there had been innumerable protests and undertakings launched to prohibit smoking on public places. And now, with the calling to ban smoking on restaurants all over the country, I am now ready to take my part. I do agree to ban smoking on all restaurants in the country for the following reasons: First: restaurants are public places and smoking on public places entails hazardous effects not just on the smoker himself but also to the other people on those public places, because even non-smoker might inhale the smoke produce from the use of cigarettes, which as we know, brought several lung diseases. Second: it is very disrespectful and ungentle to smoke while other people are having a good time in their lunch or dinner. Third: restaurant is a place for people to eat and not a place for people to smoke. Banning smoking on restaurants might also lessen the number of people who suffer from lung diseases caused by the different chemicals contained even in a single stick.
