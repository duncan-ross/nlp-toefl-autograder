I really agree with this topic. All restaurants could ban that bad behavior from the people who smoke in the area of the restaurant. The laws for ban smoker should be more strong to control them. There are many solutions we can do such as make a free space for them to smoke outside the restaurant where can avoid the bad pollution from smoking come in to a restaurant and it can help children from seeing all bad doings from adults. The government should be the first hand to solve this problem by ads on television or radio. They must coordinate with all organizations who try to protest this behavior. Using campaign to convince them from smoking in the restaurants, make the laws available in all areas and give them a harder punishment or stronger fine. Show them for negative of smoking to themselves and their family and may be more useful if they had a family already because they would care to their wife and their baby more than themselves. Policemen could manage this problem clearly and make it available in all area that there are people smoke in the restaurant. They could be fine or punish them by laws and everyone should help together to solve the problem by our hands.
