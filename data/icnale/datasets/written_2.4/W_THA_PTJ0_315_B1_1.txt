Being college student is the sign of going to be the adult. You have to study hard to use the knowledge that you get with your future job. In my university, the third year students have to practice working with the company. I think the student who has more experiences shall do better work than the less one, because they know what to do and how to collaborate with other people in his or her workplace. When I was in Grade 9, I used to do a part-time job at Nai-In Bookshop. I worked as a seller. In each day, I had to get up early and went to the bookshop at 7 o'clock. I had to sweep the floor before the bookshop open and tidy up the different kind of books on the shelves. Every Saturday, I had a meeting with the bookshop owner, who said that I didn't know how to work correctly. I felt so sad that why she had to complain me like that. After that meeting, I changed the way I work. I tried to do the other things like covering a book, being a cashier or even pack aging the books into the big boxes and send to the one who ordered. I knew that my working was improved. It'll give you the useful experiences and some money! But Thailand is a little bit different from the Western Country. Thai parents often not allow their children to have a part-time job. I think it is time to change the way we think about part-time job. It doesn't mean you have to be a servant for money but it means you'll get some experiences, money and especially, "credits" for applying your future job!
