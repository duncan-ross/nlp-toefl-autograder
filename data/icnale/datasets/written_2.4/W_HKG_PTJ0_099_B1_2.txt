A successful university student should have achieved the following targets : going out with somebody, studying, having a part-time job, living in dormitory and being a member of any school society. This is what I heard before going into university. It cannot be denied university students have to allocate their time suitably and hence enriching the three- or four-year campus life. Moreover, most university students are already adults, they need to gain some working experiences to, in addition to making money, prepare for their future. Therefore, it is admitted that having a part-time job is important for a university student, which agrees with what the must-do list suggests. My first supporting point concerns about whether university students can properly use their spare time and hence maximize the gains in different facets. Having a part-time job would undoubtedly takes up some time from the students, but this gives them opportunities to learn more about time management. The second reason regards the hyhh experience : acquiring working experience is vital to university students because it offers them chances to practice what they have learnt in school and learn something beyond books. The last reason is attributed to the most realistic stuff—money. University students can no longer be the plants in a greenhouse. Instead, they should make use of their ability to earn for themselves, but should not keep relying on their parents solely. This can also let them experience the hardship of earning. In short, having a part-time job is not merely for money, but it is also good for the growth of a university student. The manifold advantages brought up previously should be strong enough to support the fact that having a part-time job is a must for a university student.
