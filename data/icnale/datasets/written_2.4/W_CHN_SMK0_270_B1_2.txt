Whether smoking should be forbidden in the restaurant has been a focus for a long time. Some restaurants keep the non-smokers apart from the smokers to solve the problem, which I think is a good solution. It seems that the laws that smoking should be forbidden in public places such as restaurant was published several months ago, but it still don't come to effect up to now. As is known to all, smoking is harmful to health. It not only hurts the smokers but also the second-hand smokers. But it is still common to see someone smoking in public places especially in the restaurants. Though smoking is forbidden in public places, most restaurants still allow people smoking. Maybe the restaurant doesn't have the authority to ban the diners from smoking, so some keeps the non-smokers apart from the smokers to protect the non-smokers. To the restaurant, it's a good way to keep the non-smokers from the smokers and at the same time, it keeps its income. From my point of view, it will be a long time before smoking is away from the public. Only when the smokers will be fine seriously or the people's quality has been highly improved, nobody will smoke in the public.
