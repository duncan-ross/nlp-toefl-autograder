Smoking in public shall be absolutely forbidden. Smoking being very bad for human being's health is nearly known as a truth. All of the smokers know it as well. They could hardly get rid of it just because they are used to it. For this, many products had been produced to help smokers to get rid of smoking. But still there are large quantities of smokers. I have been suffering for second smoking for long. My father is a solid smoker. He smoked before I was born. Now it is thirty years for his smoking age. When I was in the army, I bought him two sets of product to help him get rid of smoking. But it failed. So we can see how difficult it is to get rid of it. If we got the habit of smoking for the public smoking, what an awful thing it will be! Beside this, smoking could also lead to fire. Lots of examples told us that smoking in public is a serious reason for public fire. It may cause a great loss of public possession. For example, the big fire in the International Hotel in HaErBin, October Nineteen of 1985, which was caused by smoking, led to the death of ten person. Let alone the forest fire. All in all, smoking in public shall be forbidden absolutely.
