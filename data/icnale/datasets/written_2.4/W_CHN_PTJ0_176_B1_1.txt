In fact, there are many college schools in our country, even some campus are very famous over in China, over the world. It just has a famous name; some schools acquire students to hand on lots of money. As we all know that not all of our families have enough money to pay for our education, including me. So, in my eyes, it is important for us to have a part-time job, especially on campus. Study is the most important thing for us in today's society, and we should put it in the first place. But who think about it that when we have dinners every day, what support us. --the money. What I say is mainly about economic. For example, when we finish our homework or some activities in Students Union at weekends then we can find a part-time job in the school or around our own campus. And this not affects our studies at first. Just look back, when we have the money which we earn by ourselves, we must be so excited at that time and proud of ourselves. In my point, on campus we should work hard and do the best about it. But on the other hand we also find a part-time job so that when we enter into the society we have enough experience to deal with it!
