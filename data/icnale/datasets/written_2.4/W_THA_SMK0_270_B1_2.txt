Smoking is very bad to health. It has only one advantage that is making smoker happy. It causes many diseases such as, lung cancer etc. It not only damages the smoker but all people who are near smoker. I'm the one who is very hate smoking, hate someone smoking near me and I don't think that smoker is good-looking because I'm annoyed its smell. I want government to solve this problem as soon as they can, so I agree to that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because most restaurants have room that air-conditioner is installed, so if someone smoke, All people in that room can smell. I think that if smoking can't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, it should have zone for smoking and if someone smokes in the room that inhibits smoking, he must pay a fine. I also think that in the other public places should have smoking zone because most people are annoyed smoking smell and it also damage anyone that he doesn't know. Finally, In my imagine, I want to see the reducing number of smoker in Thailand because I want all people to have a good life and have a white city.
