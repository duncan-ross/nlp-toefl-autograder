I agree with the question. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to experience before getting a job. For example, if students who are finished university get a job and have to hardly work, they cannot accurately work. That is because they have not enough experiences. In my case, Part time job is important to many university students. Doing part time job help more grow up man. And get a confidence. I spend waste money. So I always no money. Every day I have loan and sad mind. Near my friends, some guy never do part time job. And he provides all money from his parents. He spends money buying something. I lose memories with my friends. I was busy during part time job and I studied many things... I can't play with my friends. That was so sad. But I learned many things. My friends said 'you are very independence. I want to learn your ability.' I was very happy. I think I am growing. I was very shy person. But Through many experience about society I changed very activity person. I really thankful that. I can change. And I want to be a good salesperson.
