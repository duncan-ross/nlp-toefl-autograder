More and more college students have part-time jobs nowadays. Here comes a question whether it is important for us college students to have a part-time job. From my point of view, we students should take part-time jobs. Here are the reasons. Firstly, with the money we earn from the part-time jobs, we can be partly financially independent on parents. As we have become adults, we need to live an independent living step by step. Taking a part-time job gives us a chance to learn how to earn money by our own hands. Such subject helps us set the stage for a completely independent living in the future. Secondly, part-time jobs can improve our ability how to administrate our time. A part-time job isn't an easy work. Taking a part-time job will spend us a lot of time and energy. The main duty of students is to study. So, we must learn how to balance the both sides if we take a part-time job. We have to think of how much time we should spend on the jobs and how much on our study. Step by step, we can find the balance point and know how to administrate our time. Finally, we can have a chance to contact the society by taking part-time jobs. College is consisted of students. It isn't like the real society. By taking a part-time job, we can communicate with the people who have work many years and know more about the lives outside the colleges. So, we can learn more about the society. To sum up, part-time jobs help us get advanced and widen our horizon. Moreover, we can set the stage for our future life by taking part-time jobs.
