Choosing part time job is very important thing to student. I always think this question. Many students get a part time job using their summer vacation or winter vacation. Not only Doing in young age but also experiencing many things in society is good activity. To experience many things, many students invest their valuable time to get a job. However something to think about trying out the more important thing is real valuable. During summer vacation, one student serving beer or hoof too many guys. While he serving beer, he thought Like this 'Ha... Life is hard.' or 'selling hoof get a lot of money, later i want to be an owner pub' This is just to learn. 'Life is hard" later I want to be an owner at pub. In my case, I want to get a job like teaching or using my brain. Also I got a job like this. Last year I taught math to young student. It was very fresh experience to me. I never forget it. Young student loved me and I taught very enthusiastically. Student's parents said 'Thank you.' I said 'you're welcome' It was wonderful experience. This way, getting a job is important Through this experience I learned to meet other parents and how to look at young students. This processing was grown up me. I didn't know how to face to face other parents and young student. But l learned very hard and I recognized how to meet other people. So I think that getting a part time job is exactly helpful in their life. However Question of what is important to choose something.
