Indonesia is one of country which produced tobacco and it's the biggest of the world. That we can export tobacco to other country for example Germany, Dutch and some country in Europe and also one of the biggest a producer of cigarettes from many kind of brand produced. So that Indonesia is the country with the biggest number of smoker from kids to men or women. Mostly of them smoking in the public place like in the restaurant so government must made a rule about ban to smoking in the public place with there'll be a special place to smoker because in the restaurant very much food and drink can bring hazard's cigarette by mouth, smoke of cigarette by noise etc. I agree with that because smoking can make any disease comes like cancer and any other disease so for people who's not smoking that we know as passive smoker have more serious danger. So number of smoker in Indonesia can decrease and not much people get any disease. I think smoking's ban not only in the restaurant but also in the public place another like café, market, streets and any other public service. Besides government must be serious with this problem and give distinct punishment to people not obey the rule. Government also must give attend from cigarette circulation in the markets.
