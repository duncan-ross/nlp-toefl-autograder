I am strongly against smoking, so I agree with this proposition. This is especially so as restaurants are usually confined areas and there is a higher chance that second hand smoke would be inhaled. Studies show that second hand smoke causes more harm than the damage done to the smoker. Smoking is harmful but smokers tend to be overconfident that harm would only fall upon others, and not upon themselves. Restricting places where people can smoke may aid in discouraging the frequency of smoking, as well as discourage non smokers from picking up the habit. However, restricting smoking may harm business, especially for bars or restaurants that caters to the overnight crowd. Food and beverage business is a competitive industry in Singapore, and while the governmental bodies have been encouraging entrepreneurship, this may be a great blow to some businesses and reduce their already marginal profits. Fights may also ensue when owners try to stop customers from smoking. If this proposition is to be past as law, it is important that enforcement could be carried out smoothly and successfully. Hence, I would suggest that the proposition be changed to include only family friendly restaurants, and not all types of restaurants.
