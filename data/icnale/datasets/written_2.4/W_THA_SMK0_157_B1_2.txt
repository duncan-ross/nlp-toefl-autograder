I think smoking should not be allowed in public places. Smoking can harm everyone in the restaurant. According to scientific studies, smoking harms second-hand smoker's body more than the smoker. Unlike smokers, second-hand smokers do not have a choice to breathe the smoke that may cause heart disease, asthma and lung cancer. Smokers should not involve innocent people in their unhealthy choices. Moreover, children have a higher risk of receiving the negative effects of smoking their developing lungs and their small control over their surroundings. Furthermore, cigarette smoke can also cause q cancer to innocent people and other disorders to various types of people. This is based primarily on the fact that second-hand smoke is a health hazard, but it can also be argued that allowing people to smoke in public only perpetuates the habit and encourages others to take it up, thus adding to the health hazard in the long run. The private sector is already addressing the issue on a case-by-case basis, banning smoking in the workplace in many companies. Those who believe there is a problem may create a smoke-free area for customers or workers, or workers can demand that their place of business be entirely smoke free. Still, the government should take further action to protect the public where companies do not, including in shopping areas, workplaces, theaters, restaurants, and anywhere the public gathers. Allowing smoking on the street in fact encourages smoking, and discouraging smoking should be a primary effort for the public and private sectors to reduce the health costs paid by both.
