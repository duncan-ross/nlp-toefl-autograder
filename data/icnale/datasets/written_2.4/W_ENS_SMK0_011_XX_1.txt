Let me start off by saying that I have never actually been to Japan. I don't know anyone that's been to Japan either, but I do have one Japanese friend. One of the things she has always told me is that smoking is very accepted and sometimes even encouraged in Japan. This came as quite a shock to me, because my parents have always strongly discouraged me from smoking or using any kind of tobacco products. She even told me that her father was the one to go up to her younger brother when he was only 14 and asked him if you would like to smoke. I thought that almost everyone was aware of the fact that smoking can kill you. This is a very serious thing in my family because both of my grandfathers died from lung cancer as a result of smoking. When they were young, smoking was much more common in America than it is now, and not every one really knew about the fact that smoking was really bad. In fact, some people thought it was good for you. So, people from past generations cannot be blamed for smoking, but I do think that people from this generation should take advantage of all the research that has been done and keep themselves healthy.
