First I agree it's important to take a part-time job for college students. Because I think that's a good opportunity to acquire work experiences before graduate. And I also think though the experiences I can learn more skill about interaction. Besides I can take part-time job to earn some extra money, so it makes me have more good economic, and I also will not waste those times. So why don't I take a part-time job? Like me, now I have a part-time job at my college's office, I know a lot of friends from there and have fun in this place. I love my workplace and my boss is a nice person, too. So I strongly agree it's an important thing to take a part-time job even more. Actually I feel as college students include me of course, we should not only focus our study, we must think why we study in a college? I believe Colleges not only just give me a graduation certificate but also I must train myself in my four years university, So that I can easily find a job before I graduate. When other students all lounged, I already think my future and my career planning. Only prepare in advance, I will not confuse when I get in trouble. I really hope I can be a well-prepared man.
