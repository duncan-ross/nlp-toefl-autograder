As smoking can cause lung issues and has a stronger effect on the surrounding people, some politicians hold the view that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in this country, which I can hardly approve. I have the following reasons to clarify my point. Firstly, in terms of health, it is undeniable that cigarette is not the only thing that does harm to our body. Should we ban all the fried food just because they are junk food? I think the answer should be no. Secondly, smokers' choices determine smokers' consequences. It's not our business to interfere others' lifestyles compulsorily even though it can kill them gradually. As we cannot ban suicide, we cannot ban smoking. To make us free from the infection, restaurant managers can set smoking rooms to satisfy the smokers without affecting the other customers. And we can put posters to remind the smokers the risks they are taking. But forbid? No. I agree that smoking is the last habit we could form, but since it is a controversial and complicated social issue, we should handle it carefully instead of simply forbidding it completely. We can solve the problem through different kinds of methods gradually.
