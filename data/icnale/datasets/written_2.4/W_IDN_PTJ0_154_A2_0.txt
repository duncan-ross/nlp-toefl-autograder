In my opinion, student to have a part – time job I am agree because in college, student have a many blank time. And to fill it student can find the part – time job. Because part – time job is not disturb the student studying time. Student need not work every day or work long hours. That student can find the part time job as the like. Such as working in Mc Donald, KFC, Wendy, A&W, etc. If the student have a part – time job, student have much experience. After that student can make a his social network. With this the student have a many friend. And when the student finish the college student have many experience and student have many friend. With that student can become be a successful businessman or a business woman. In my experience I have a part- time job. In my part time job I am make a network to sell my product and it is working. In that I can found money and I'm not junk my time for always studying. I need not ask my parents for money every day. In that I have many friend and I have many customers.
