I think part-time work is important for college students. This is because I myself have a part-time job, and I think that it is helping me a lot. Before I came to college, I had no work experience, but now that I've been a college for a while, I have gained enough experience to consider myself ready to enter the business world when I graduate from school next year. I have pursued internships every summer since I was a freshman, and through these internships I have gained quite a variety of skills. My first summer, I worked as an IT assistant at a local computer store, and the next summer, I was part of the university's IT and security team. The following summer, I continued my position at the university, and I believe I will do so the coming summer as well. From all of these experiences, my eye key skills have become very well developed, and IT is a big business these days, so I feel that I have done a good job in getting myself into a position where it will be easy to acquire a full time job after I graduate. So, other students would be benefited by following this kind of idea, and I therefore think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
