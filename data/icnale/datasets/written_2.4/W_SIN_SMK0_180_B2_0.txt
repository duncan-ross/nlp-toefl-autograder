In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. While in Singapore smoking is definitely prohibited in restaurants nationwide, some countries such as Japan have the culture of smoking within eateries. Smoking, while enjoyable as a social activity and as a stress reliever to some, has harmful health effects on people, and not everyone is comfortable about having to breathe in second hand smoke, especially because second hand smoke is even more harmful than the first hand experience of smoking. It is not merely about the health issues that discomfort people, some also feel that the smell of smoke is nauseating and off-putting, so to have to endure smoke while enjoying food will turn that enjoyment into discontentment. Plus, the smoke might even cover the natural smell and taste of the food, and it also alters the atmosphere of the restaurant, which might be the reasons why the customers choose the patronize the store for. Yet, some people smoke not because of habit but for socializing, and by strictly prohibiting smoking in all restaurants they might face difficulty in social interaction, but for the greater good of non smokers, who typically form the majority of any society, smoking should definitely still be banned in all restaurants.
