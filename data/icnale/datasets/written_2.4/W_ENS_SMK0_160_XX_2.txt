In my view, smoking cigarettes should be banned in public places including all restaurants because it has a lethal affect on all those that it come in contact with. We now know that smoking is also hazardous to non-smokers who become passive smokers when they inhale any smoke from a smoker in the nearby vicinity. Many countries have already implemented numerous bans on smoking in certain public spaces as has Japan. I believe that Japan should take the next step and also extend the ban to include restaurants because restaurants are well frequented and a lot of lives are unnecessarily placed at risk when they allow smoking. I would also like to point out glaring contradictions that I have seen in several countries with regards to smoking. I have seen parents who smoke, but who will never smoke near their children however they are quite happy to go off to their local public space and smoke to their heart's content. Of course, not smoking around children, their own or others, is a fine thing, but why not extend their thinking a little further and think about the rest of the community. Surely this will lead to confusing the children as to what is the morally appropriate form of conduct, at home or in public.
