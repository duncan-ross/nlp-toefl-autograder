It's known to us all that smoking can be harmful to our health. However, people never stop doing it. What's more, they even smoke in some public situations. Smoking is banned in libraries, classrooms and so on. Then, how about at the restaurants, should we ban it too? Some people believe it is a different problem from what happens in libraries. The restaurant is a place that people can be relaxed. For some people only smoke can they feel better. On the other hand, cigarettes as well as wine have already become a culture of eating. Due to contribute to the economy, more people wish it can exist. But I can't agree with them. When they smoking for relaxing, do they care about others' feelings. Smoking can destroy environment, people who don't smoke can be struggle in this situation. It will be worse if there are some children. And the culture of eating can't be an excuse that we connive at it. With the human developed, we have given up many bad cultures and customs. So, why should it be different for smoking? Then we turn to talk about economy, we have already banned gamble which can have a larger influence. So it can't be a reason either. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Maybe we should choose some acceptable way to help smokers face these challenges.
