As we all know, smoking is really bad for our health and the environment as well. During the Expo, smoking is banned in public places. And I find most people can obey the principle. Thus making the air is more fresh and showing the Chinese virtue. After the Expo, I think we should stick to the principle that abandoning the smoking in the public. Good principle should remain and this can improve the whole figure of Shanghai. And we can see more and more non-smoking sighs in the public in order to remind people to cling to it. The results of many researches have shown that the second-hand smoking even has worse effect on others especially children and the old. So when we want to smoke in the public, please think of them. They are innocent. If they are your family members, do you want them have second-hand smoking? Of course, absolutely banning the smoking in China or in Shanghai is impossible. People can smoke freely in private place or in the smoking area in the public. Nowadays more and more non-smoking rooms have been set up in the public places. It shows a good tendency that we have realized this kind of problem and have tried some methods to solve the problem step by step. And then I truly believe that we will lead a healthier and happier life.
