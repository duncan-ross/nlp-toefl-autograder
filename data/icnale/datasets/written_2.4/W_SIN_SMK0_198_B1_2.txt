 I disagree with the statement. I believe that everyone in Singapore has a right to do what they want, including smoking in restaurants. Such a phenomenon is uncommon in Singapore and it is a harsh statement. Smoking is harmful to one's health and the government has stepped up measures to curb the problem of inhaling in too much second hand smoke in public places. Furthermore, it would be difficult to enforce the rule of completely banning smoking at all restaurants. There would surely have those that will find ways and means to bend the rules. On the bright side, I observed that customers in the restaurant usually have the habit of going outside the restaurant to have a puff too. Thus the smell of the smoke is un-noticeable in restaurants usually. It would be good if smoking can be banned in restaurants in Singapore, as it would mean a better dining environment for all of the customers in the restaurant itself, and everyone can have a meal with a piece of mind, without worrying about second hand smoke. If there is such a ban I believe that it would quite a long time for its full effects to completely materialise. 200 words
