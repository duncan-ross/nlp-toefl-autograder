Smoking kills. Don't they ever read the government warning even in a pack of a cigar? Smokers just don't listen. Smokers really are examples of a non tremulant and careless people. They don't care about what's happening in their system especially in their lungs. Despite that the government raises the price of tobacco to discourage people from smoking, smokers still continue to be a loyal fan of this habit and often waste their earnings just for cigarettes. Some governments had recently set up a law against smoking in public places, pub's, and some other places like restaurant. Would you rather breathe the smoke that's causing pollution or breathe the fresh air coming in your way? Some people hate to inhale the smoke from a cigar especially when eating a delicious food or sustenance from specialties of other restaurants. Smokers enjoy smoking to relax and have a peace of mind and to a greater degree, when that restaurant has the music that soothes and relates with your mood. Well, aren't they concern about the people around? You wouldn't even enjoy eating. Probably they will move to other spot just to evade the smoke. Besides that, owners will worry about their chairs or tables being burned and damaged by a simple stick of cigar. Indeed, smoking in restaurants must be banned. On the outcome of restricting smokers to use a certain place like a part of the restaurant, smokers will shift to another place causing them to smoke less frequent in restaurants. Having a cleaner, healthier environment especially in a restaurant will have a better cycle of the place and helping to boom the industries.
