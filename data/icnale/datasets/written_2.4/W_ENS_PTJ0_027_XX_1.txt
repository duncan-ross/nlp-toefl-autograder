I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job because it allows them to give back in some small way to the college community while at the same time receiving compensation for their services. Too many people these days think only of what they can take a nothing of what they can give. As John F. Kennedy once said, "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country. " The same idea applies to schools, and student should be active members of the college community in order to be successful community members. Next, a part-time job is a great way for students to take a break from studying. Some students will simply study until their brains hurt, and at that time, if you have a part-time job that is not too mentally taxing, you can go to work and let your brain unwind before you return to your studies. This assumes that the student can find a part-time job that will not take away too much of their time. I think the ideal of numbers of hours a week that a student should work is somewhere around 10 hours. This is not too much of a time commitment and even in the busiest weeks of the semester, the student should be able to find a way to schedule enough time for their school, work, and social activities.
