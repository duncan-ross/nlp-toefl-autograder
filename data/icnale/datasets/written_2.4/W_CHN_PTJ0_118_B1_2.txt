 As far as I'm concerned, it makes great difference for college students to have part-time jobs. In the best condition, you can find a job in which you can apply knowledge to practice. In this way, while you are making money, you are strengthening your knowledge as well. That may help you get high marks in tests and can promote your ability to act. Even if you cannot find such a job, other work such as salesmen or waitresses, are beneficial. They train you to be experienced, that is, through the part-time jobs, you get a glimpse of the real world. You will learn how to get along with various people and how to adjust to the society. This is another essential trait. Since we've already been adults, another reason to have a part-time job is responsibility. As adults, we should pay for our own expenses and weaken the burden of our families. What's more, I think a part-time job can prevent you from being addicted to computers. A part-time job keeps you busy and energetic and it won't leave you too much time for computers. I guess it's time that college students got down to finding a part-time job. Let's go out of the campus and enter the society!
