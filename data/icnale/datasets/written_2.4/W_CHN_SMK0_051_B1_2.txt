Smoking is harmful for us. Though many people know this simple truth, they still smoke in public places, especially restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants. Firstly, everyone knows that cigarettes have bad component which can cause cancer. So we should smoke less or we'd better not smoke cigarette whether we're at restaurants. Secondly, if one person smokes at restaurant, other people around him will be affected and those people may suffer the second hand smoke. In fact, it is unfair to the people who do not smoke. However, not only does the smoker damage his health, he also damages other people's health. In my view, no one should have the "right" to inflict a health hazard on anyone else. And it's necessary to ban smoking completely at all restaurants. Furthermore, if someone really wants to smoke, he can go outside and have a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he can come in. All in all, we should have the right attitude towards smoking. Though some people enjoy the pleasure which is brought by the smoking, we should recognize the harmful aspects of smoking. Smoking in public is not only a hazard for the smokers and every smoker must take responsibility for other people around. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
