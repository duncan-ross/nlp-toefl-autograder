In today's society, more and more college students have part time job after school. In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time. Part time job is essential for students as part time job makes a student more active, gives some experiences and student can earn some pocket money. Part time job is defined when students do some job besides their study so that they can able spend their leisure time properly. For an example, students cannot keep themselves busy all the time. Sometimes they take some time for relaxing or spending leisure period. There are some students who get bored spending more leisure periods. So for them to be alive they start to take a job for spending their leisure. As a result they become more active in their daily life and get more concern about their study too. Sometimes part time job gives a student some experiences. It is true before getting a permanent job or big job every people should have to get experiences about what they will going to be do in future. For an example, students are given some offers for internship before graduating from university. That internship is kind of part time job which give students some experiences for their future job. The one of most profitable for student is pocket money. Students those are doing part time job they can earn some money so sometimes they don't have to ask their parents for giving them some money. If students take a job for part time, continue that job so they can able to achieve profit in different ways. At the end they will become more efficient, more perfect and more profitable in their future life.
