There are two large groups of people in Singapore who may engage in smoking activities. One group consists of people from the older generation who saw smoking as a sign of social and financial status, picked it up and then found it difficult to kick the habit, thereby continuing to smoke. Another group comprises the younger teenagers who thought smoking as a sign of coolness and picked up the habit in the hope of impressing people their age or to make a statement. Unfortunately, these people are those who frequent restaurants as well and this may cause problems in the eateries. In my opinion, smoking is detrimental not only to the perpetrator's health, but also to countless others who may have to linger around them. They destroy the lungs, stain teeth and confer bad breath. It is unmistakably a vice which should be banned from the country totally. Although this may seem a radical action; however, such extreme actions had been carried out successfully before, most notably in the banning of chewing gum from the country. Even though people may still smuggle in chewing gum occasionally, the current situation is probably much better than if it were not banned; it was always a show of intent from the government for the citizens to follow its lead. Hence, smoking should not simply be banned from restaurants, it should be banned from the country totally for the health of current generations and to create a better environment for future generations to live in.
