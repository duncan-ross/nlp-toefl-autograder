I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons for it. First, smoking has smell. Some people including me have a headache when they are near the people who are smoking. People like me loss an appetite. Second, the smoke causes a cancer. Smoking in the place which many people are in like restaurants may cause their cancer. On the other hand, there are some people who disagree to my opinion. Most of them sill be smokers. They can not be without smoking, of course even if they are in a restaurant. They may think that there is no problem if the restaurants are divided into two areas: Smoking area and No Smoking area. Many restaurants have been divided into two areas, but they can not be divided completely. Smoke comes to the No Smoking area. I can understand some smokers' opinion, but the health of no smoker is also important. Of course smoking is bad for smoker's health. If smoking completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers may get rid of smoking. If they give up smoking, they will be better in health. This is good for all people.
