As a part-time nurse, this question really strikes home, because I've been doing it for a long time. I've been working as a part-time nurse ever since I was in college, and it has already been a great experience. It is really satisfying to see how your work can help others, and it is really great to see the smile of a family when one of their loved ones becomes well. Similar to this, I'm sure that there are many perks to other part-time jobs, and different students will find different pleasures from different endeavors. For me, I was lucky enough to find a good husband who brings in most of that income in our household, so I don't really have to worry about having a fulltime job. If I had not met him, I would probably have been much more motivated to finish my degree and find a full time gig so that I could support myself. This goes to show then there are a variety of individuals in the world, and each individual's situation is so unique that it is difficult to make a broad or all expansive judgment that will hold true for everyone. This is another way to say that the student should decide for himself or for herself if a part-time job is a good way to spend their time.
