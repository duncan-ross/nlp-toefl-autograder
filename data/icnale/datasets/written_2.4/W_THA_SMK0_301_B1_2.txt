Smoking, it's not extremely good for the public. It's should be banned for many public places where too many people are there. Because when one smokes, the others who don't smoke may be unsatisfied. The place where the smoking should be banned for the first place is restaurant. There are many restaurants where the smoking can be allowed. In my opinion, there are many reasons that it should not be allowed although that restaurant has the smoking area. When one smokes the cigar, it's sure that it will have too much of smoke in the air. The smoke can be in the air and can through from the smoking area to the inside of the restaurant where too many people are having their food. The smoke of the cigar can be caused of unhealthy, especially for the very little children, anyone who has the problems about the respiratory system, or an old people. They are too little to breathe the smoke and too unhealthy. It isn't good image for the restaurant. When the smoking can be allowed in the restaurant, that restaurant may be missed the clients because of disliking of the personality. He may dislike the smoking of his reason, so he doesn't want com into the restaurant where the smoking be allowed. The smoking isn't good for the public, for example in the because of many reasons, such as unhealthy, image or the reason of the personality and so on. Therefore; it shouldn't be allowed.
