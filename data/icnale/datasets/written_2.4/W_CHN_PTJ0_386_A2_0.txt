I think it's necessary for us college students to have a part-time job. We all know that part-time job is important for students. There are four reasons can account for my ideas. Firstly, we have adequate time to do it. And, to some degree, having a part-time job doesn't cause bad effect on study. On the contrary, it makes us to study more efficiently and quickly. Secondly, we should learn to be more independent gradually, and having a part time job can help us to form this ability. Although, the sum of money itself maybe is not very large, but the meaning it contains are far over it. And, I believe you must be very happy when you get the wage, aren't you? Thirdly, we can enter into and touch the society earlier than the ones who stay in school all day, which is important for us definitely. For we have working experience rather than not experienced. And, experience in job hunt has great significances. All in all, I agree it's necessary for college students to have a part time job.
