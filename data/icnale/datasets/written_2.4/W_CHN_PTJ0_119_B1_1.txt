It is very important for college students to have a part time job. Now in many universities, there are some college students having a part job, such as sticking posters, to do private tutor, or to be the model. Students to have a part time job not only can make some money to change their life but also can gain experience. as a college students in the new century, who hasn't some societal experience, maybe will miss a good job, or miss a change of building a efficient network of relationship, which is the most important in the future. I have a part time job now. When some companies want to make a recruitment meeting, I and my classmates are working for them. For this, I can get a lot of money, and the most valuable, I have knew the recruitment process, so I can prepare from now on. If one overcome the sense of tense, I think his success rate will become high than who doesn't. And I have known several mentors they gave me great help. They help me pass through the confused in the university. I thank them a lot; we have built a hard friendship. So I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.
