Nowadays, smoking people are a lot, but, people who don't smoke or don't like the smell of smoke are more than smoking people. It is harmful for body to smoke. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoke has no benefit for body. Some people just can't stop but to smoke, they smoke no matter where they are. They don't think about people that around them. Maybe some people feel uncomfortable or don't like the smell. Therefore, I think smoke in the public is a bad manner. In some shopping malls, stores or air ports have some space to serve people smoke. This is a good for people who want to smoke. But, I don't think plus this space in restaurants is a great idea. Because we eat meal in the restaurants, I think nobody want to smell smoke when you are eating something. In my opinion, it is necessary that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Having a comfortable environment is everybody's right, and the people who smoke shouldn't annoy the others when they making dinner. Don't smoke in the restaurant is a basic manner, doesn't is?
