I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As kwon to all, smoking is harmful to people. When you smoke, the tobacco burns and give off a lot off smokes that are harmful to your body especially to your lungs. A medical experiment shows that people who smoke a lot get lung cancer and other similar ills more than those who didn't smoke. So everyone should try their best not to smoke. What's worse, the medial experiment shows that one people smokes will do more harm to people beside him/her. Restaurants are public place, if you smoke, others will be affected. It's impolite to smoke in public places. If there are children eating, the smoke given off by tobacco will do more harm to them. Now, many developed countries have set series of lows to forbid people from smoking in public places, e. g. internet café, restaurants, shopping center and so on. Then, why didn't we ask people not to smoke and just forbid them from smoking in restaurants and other public places? Because we must take steps one by one. Otherwise there will suddenly be lots of workers who have no job. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
