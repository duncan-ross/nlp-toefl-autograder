In the case of junior high school and high school students, it is perhaps a good idea for them to work part-time, in order to gain some practical appreciation of the difficulty of earning a living. Young people who have never worked at all, but have simply been given whatever they wanted, tend to be rather spoilt, and to seem unaware of how hard one has to work to be able to buy things. In the case of college students, on the other hand, it is probable that they already have some work experience, and, if they have no financial need to work, because they receive sufficient money from their parents or from a state scholarship, I do not think it is important for them to work part-time. On the contrary, part-time work takes up time that would be better invested in their studies. Of course, if college students do not have enough money to live on, it is essential, rather than "important", for them to earn money. However, in that case, it is wise for them to take the best-paid jobs they can get, and typical part-time student jobs, such as working in shops, bars or restaurants, tend to be poorly paid, and it would therefore be better for them to take temporary jobs, in construction work, for example, during the college vacation.
