Every man has the right to make his future strong. to take such actions that can secure his future. in the cut throat competition of two days world everyone is struggling for the betterment of his or her self. There are so many problems in our country that has become a constant source of worry for our citizens. One of the problems is price hike and insufficient salaries of the people. In Pakistan there is a growing trend of part time job. The point is thinking that from where trend has stared. Now days in Pakistan it become hard to earn bread and butter by single person with such a low salary. Govt. of Pakistan is unaware of that problem. the salaries of people are not so sufficient of support their families. hence for support they go for the second option i. e. part time job. But it becomes so difficult to manage because usually one can give full attention to only one job at a time. It is so heart touching to see the students doing part time job to sport their studies. Govt. should have to take notice of this situation. part time job is not as bad as it seems. It depends on the purpose for which you are doing so. it is totally prohibited for students because they can affect their studies by doing so. But if you are doing that to take experience or to support your nation then well and good. in short part time job has become a kind of necessity for people. They want to give better future to their families and it cannot be possible with low salaries that the Govt. is giving. so they should have adopt a side business or part time job. Perhaps it has its own advantages and disadvantages but they vary from person to person and their purpose of doing so.
