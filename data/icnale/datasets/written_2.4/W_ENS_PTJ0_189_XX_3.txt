I disagree. If students spend a lot of their time working then that is going to cut into the time that they should be spending on their studies. There may also be travel time lost going backwards and forwards and unless the job is relevant to their future careers it will not be useful work experience. Usually, college students are working part-time jobs for the money and this is OK of course. Some students may come from affluent families and might not need the cash. If the latter is the case then it really isn't too important that they have a part-time job. The only time that they need bother with work if at all, is maybe to serve an internship somewhere. College is for study and I believe that is what students should be spending their time on mostly so they have a chance at graduating with solid scores. Being involved with anything else is only going to take them away from their main study goals. Some leisure time is fine because it gives them a chance to unwind a bit and take their mind off things. I worked my way through college and I know how stressful it was for me quite a bit of the time and although I graduated, if I was doing it all again, I would make sure that I had the cash upfront first.
