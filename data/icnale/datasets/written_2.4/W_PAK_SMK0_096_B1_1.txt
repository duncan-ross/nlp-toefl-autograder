I think this topic is very necessary to be discussed. As smoking is becoming a fashion among people, so that now smokers are performing their job very well. Every where and in every place smoking is becoming habit. Usually the restaurants, which are becoming the house of smokers. Yes it should be prohibited. I want to give an example to the smokers so that they may understand that smoking is not just dangerous to their health but it also leaves its effects on others. Now just imagine that for example if you are tired and want some relax, mean want to sleep or any thing by which you feel comfort and then suddenly a crowed of children came to you and asked you to play with them etc. How irritation will be felt by you at that time? Yeah, same happens when you people smoke in the public rooms and especially in Restaurants. People come their to be relaxed and to get some change from their daily routines but the smoke of your cigarettes badly effect them and some who are very sensitive suffered in some throat problems as well. If a man is suffering in just because of some smoke in the air then what will happens to you after smoking one cigarette. So please think on it. And for your kind information, one cigarette decreases 15 minutes of man's life. I am not giving here the comments on this issue that because of cigarette environment is polluted etc. Because these are very basic things and every one should have at least this sense, which is actually our common sense. So at the end I will finish my talk by saying that if you doesn't care of yourself then can you please do care of others, you have to do it. So I am strongly agreed with that smoking should be banned in restaurants.
