How much money do you spend each year in the university? And what do you spend money on besides daily diet? Have you ever thought how hard your parents earn money? Have you ever thought what we should do to help our parents reduce their pressure? I think a part-time job is necessary. So far from we born, our clothes, our toys, our bikes, our computers, our breakfast, lunch, and supper etc., all of these things are given by our parents. They give us everything even themselves and we all know that we should do something to show filial obedience for our parents. But, how? We can do something what we can even it is very small. For example, help our mother do some housework or cook the dinner. And a part-time job is also a nice choice which can reduce their economic pressure. Many college students think that the main job of us is study and we are busy in our activities and study so that we have no time to do a part –time job. As far as I'm concerned, we have time to play games, spend time with our girl(boy)friend. We also have time to do a job. Even a part-time job will not give us much, but we can use the little salary to buy a gift for our parents to tell them that we love them. It's better than saying thank you. These are my opinions.
