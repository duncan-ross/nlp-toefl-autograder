I support the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in a country. While I think this smoking ban is already practiced in Singapore, it may not be so in other countries. I am strongly against smoking in restaurants, as it is my fundamental belief that smoking is not only harmful to health, it also constitutes antisocial behaviour. Many studies have shown that spectators' exposure to second-hand smoke result in harmful bodily effects that equal that of the smoker's. This is especially so for children and babies. Restaurants in Singapore are generally enclosed areas where people mingle in close proximity. Thus, one smoker has the ability to negatively impact all restaurant patrons. Even for restaurants with outdoor seating, smoke tends to linger in the air for a period of time before dissipating. It is only right for smokers to exercise social responsibility and light their cigarettes away from these spaces, where the purpose is to socialise and enjoy a good meal. A ban on smoking in restaurants, as well as other public places such as bus stops, decreases the likelihood of exposure to unwanted second-hand smoke. These restrictions may also compel smokers to stub out the habit eventually, as they realise that society is un-accepting of such behaviour.
