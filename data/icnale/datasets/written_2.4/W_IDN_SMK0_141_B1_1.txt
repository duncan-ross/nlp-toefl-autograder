Majority of people know that cigarette is very dangerous and give many bad influences to their bodies, also passive smoker. In addition, they also aware that smoking will consume much to their money only, furthermore they will get nothing just feeling enjoy for a moment. I also aware about that but personally I disagree if the government will ban smoking in the restaurant. Though, I always feel disturb with the smoker but I assume that government should take other effort to decrease influence of smoking. In the future, if government will ban smoking in the restaurant, we won't be able to think the condition of restaurant, they will be loss or maybe bankrupt because the guests especially men, however women likely to smoker after they eating will not come. Furthermore, we can imagine that there are a few restaurant only and certainly, it is bad fact to the people especially carrier woman and their families who prefer to eat in the restaurant because she has not enough time to cook and busy with other activities. They will confuse to choose place where they will eat. Alternative way to minimize bad impact of smoker who are the guests of certain restaurant, management of restaurant should provide smoking area that is allow the guest smoke. I am quite sure that it will not disturb other guests and restaurant still keep fresh environment. Beside that, in my view, although government will ban smoking in the restaurant, it will not work well and ineffective enough without awareness of the smokers. To conclude government should not ban smoking in the restaurant because it will make the restaurant loss and make the smokers unenjoyable to come.
