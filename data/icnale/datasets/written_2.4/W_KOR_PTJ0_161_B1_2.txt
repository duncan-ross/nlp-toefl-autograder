These days part time job is a part of life to university student. Because nowadays university tuition is very expensive. So lots of people hold protest about tuition. If tuition will be cheaper than now, most of university students can enjoy their university life. But in reality, it is too difficult. So we can just accept about reality. Now I want to talk about my story. I am fresher. But first tuition is about 4, 000, 000 won. It is my parents' monthly pay. It is very huge money. We feel sorry to my parents. So we try to do part time job. If we do it, we think we can reduce burden about tuition. So I tried to find out part time job but these days pay is very cheap. The minimum system said' you need to pay over 4, 300 won but almost shops give 4, 000 won to us for monthly pay. We know all about this but we just need money for tuition. So we just keep working. It's very sad reality. I think it must change soon. I want to reduce the burden about tuition from my parents. And may be lots of students of want to do be. I think story is going little wrong but I want to tell about reality problem and I want to know why I tell about tuition.
