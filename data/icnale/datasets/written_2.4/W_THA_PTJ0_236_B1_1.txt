Very often nowadays, most people think that education is the most important in their life. Many people have to finish Bachelor's degree to be accepted in social life. However, I believe that degree is not an identification of successfulness. This essay aims to outline the advantages and disadvantages of doing a part-time job during study in university. Most people have only one target to go to university, to get their degree. While, there are many reasons for each person. For instance, somebody studies because they seek for knowledge. Someone studies because of their friends or their parents. At the first time, undergraduates have many activities to do in university. In the present, doing a part-time job is very popular. There are three main benefits of doing a part-time job during study in university. Firstly, students should do freelance works because it helps their parents' expenditure. Secondly, undergraduates should have works as freelance because it helps their education fees. Finally, the numbers of university students who have part-time job have increased. They want to gain more experience that they cannot find in the classroom. However, there are three main disadvantages of having a freelance work during study in university. The first, students tend to concentrate on their part-time jobs more than spending time on their lessons. In addition, a freelance work make students exhausted and they will not have enough time to sleep. Moreover, students might not have enough time to do their homework because of their part-time jobs. Eventually, it can be seen that a freelance work can have both positive and negative aspects. I think we should give precedence to education first. Then, we can place important on part-time job secondly. Lastly, we should manage our time in the right way and we should have responsibilities in our positions.
