Smoking is the activity that can make some of the people feel comfort. They think that the stress will be gone by smoking. For some people, they will smoking in everywhere they can, in this case in restaurant. But for other people, it's disturbing. From this case, I will argue that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the whole country. First, it should be banned because the some that is produced from that activity is harmful. Smoke from that activity, if it is inhaled by people, it can be more harmful. The smoke can make their lungs is not healthy again because of that smoke. The smoke can make the air in the restaurant more dangerous. Next, it should be banned because it's the disturbing activity. Some people won't eat foods when they see that near them is smoking person. The smoke, again, can make them won't eat the foods. The effect of that is, for the restaurant, the profit that the restaurant earned will be down. It's because the people don't want to eat in the restaurant that has not healthy air. From that reasons, the smoke is harmful and it's a disturbing activity, I say that the smoking activity should be banned in all restaurants in the whole country. If necessary, they can take some money from the smoking people. For all the smokers, stop smoking from now, because it's not healthy for your lungs and your body.
