Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because smoking indoors affects everyone inside the building, both smokers and non-smokers. Dividing dining rooms into smoking and non-smoking areas does not provide a true shelter from the smoke for non-smokers, nor does designating times when smoking is not allowed, but allowing smoking during other times. The smoke lingers in the air throughout the restaurant and creates an unpleasant odor that certainly affects the customers' dining experience. Restaurateurs should be concerned about this because fragrance is a large part of enjoying food, and having cigarette smoke mixed into the air will have negative effects on non-smokers, who did nothing to add that smoke to the atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers who do not want to be around smoke while they are eating will find a different place to eat given the choice, or may even decline invitations to restaurants where smoking is allowed, which represents a loss of business for restaurateurs. A physical disadvantage to allowing smoking inside of a restaurant is that wallpaper yellows and needs to be replaced more often due to exposure to smoke over time. Add to that the possible loss of business due to non-smokers choosing other restaurants, and it starts to make financial sense to ban smoking inside restaurants. Japan features some restaurants with smoking areas or rooms fully enclosed by walls or glass with special fans sucking the smoky air out of the room, and these seem to work well toward keeping smoke away from the rest of the restaurant. If installing these smoking rooms is cost-effective, there could be a way to allow smoking inside of restaurants, but it may be the only way if non-smokers exercise their right to decide and take their business elsewhere.
