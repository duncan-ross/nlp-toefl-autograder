 As far as I am concerned, smoking is a pretty awful behavior, especially in public places, so I deem that smoking should be forbidden in public places. There are following reasons: Above all, smoking in public places not only does great harm to your own health, but also pollutes the surrounding air so that the other people beside you will be forced to smoke. According to some researches, second hand smoking increases the disease rate, such as lung cancer, heart attack, etc. In other words, if you smoke in public places, both you and people around you will be damaged. Secondly, smoking in public places will influence the image of the city. Imagine that some overseas people come to Shanghai only to find we Chinese smoke in the bus station. What impression of China they will get is obvious. In order to leave a good impression on others, we should not smoke in public places. Last but not least, after you smoke, there will exist some dust which will do harm to people coming into contact with it. In other words, it may affect people from further places. Besides the aspects upside, there exists many other harmful effects, so I feel obliged to forbid smoking in public places.
