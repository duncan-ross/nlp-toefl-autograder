I agree the statement. That is, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are some reasons. First, some of them must earn money as the cost of living themselves. In my case, money for rent is given by my parents' home. But, I must pay almost of the cost of eating by myself. The person whose environment is like me is being everywhere. Second, if they have enough of money, they would be able to buy a lot of things. For example, clothes, books, comics, and so on. We can buy whatever you want. Third, to communicate with other people, enough of money is precious. I sometimes go to a movie theater to see a movie with my friends. Money needs for it. Of course, money is not always needed to communicate with others. But, most of the chance, money is precious. Finally, to work somewhere is good experience. Not only college students but also high school students can work. But, for high school students, it is much more important to study than to work. And, some of college students will get a job after graduation. In that case, the experience of working is important. That's why that I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.
