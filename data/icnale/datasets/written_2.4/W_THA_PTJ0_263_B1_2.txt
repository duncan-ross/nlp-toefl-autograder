College student should have a part - time job. I agree with this topic because the part-time job can make the person to be a responsible person and practice to be a social person. College student like to do the part-time job as the activities. There are many reasons to show why the part-time job is interesting to do. First, Part-time job is like a short-time job to do and it can choose the starting and finishing time, it is convenient to the student who finished their school late. Second, this job can get a few money so, some student want to do the job because they want to help their parents about a learning payment. Third, doing part-time job, it will get more good experience. All the experience that you got in part-time job will help you when you are working. The last reason is make you to be a loyal person. Loyal is the habit that every company required, and you should have when you are working and it will help you a lot to get your job if you be. If the college student want to do a part-time job, they should manage their time rightly.
