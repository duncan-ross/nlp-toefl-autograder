Smoking is seen as an externality. An externality is a spill over effect to the third party who is not involved in the process of exchange between the supplier and the consumer of a good or service. In this case, smoking is seen as a negative externality of consumption. The smoker will produce smoke which will induce others around him to take in the smoke and become second hand smokers. The smoke can cause lung cancer for the second hand smokers and in turn result in death possibly. By smoking in restaurants, which are usually compact places for dining, there will be many second hand smokers since everyone will be sitting within close proximity. Thus, the impact of the smoke is catastrophic. Banning smoking in all restaurants is a major issue. Firstly, it could result in a total loss of welfare for restaurants from an economist's point of view as a total ban of smoking means smokers who enjoy smoking during or after a meal will prefer to choose other places to dine out. This results in loss of business. However, should you allow smoking, customers who are smoke-free will also give the restaurants a miss. This ultimately comes down to a cost-benefit analysis where the government has to consider the political, social and economic impact of implementing such absolute policy. The possible solution would be to implement rules or regulations which require a segregation of smokers from non-smokers such that restaurants can still accommodate all customers. This could win over the hearts of majority too.
