Smoking is a demerit good and therefore I agree that it should be banned in all restaurants island-wide. Smoking in public has been a contentious issue for years and this has led to the government's initiative of banning the activity altogether in various public spaces. Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but to innocent bystanders in the vicinity as well. Research has shown that passive smoking is equally or even more harmful than smoking itself. This is greatly unfair because people who value their health and therefore choose not to smoke, may still suffer the repercussions and ill-effects of smoking just because the air has been polluted by a smoker nearby. By banning smoking in restaurants, non-smoking customers who patronise eateries can have a smoke-free meal as they should rightfully be able to enjoy. Smoking in restaurants should also be banned because it could be a potential fire hazard. Restaurants typically have table cloths and napkins that could easily catch fire should a smoker be careless with his cigarettes for even a split-second. By banning smoking entirely from such places, the dangers of a fire breaking out are reduced. However, it is essential to note that smoking is a habitual activity and smokers simply are unable to stop as an when they are dictated to. If all public spaces ban smoking, smokers would have no choice but to resort to smoking at home which would be detrimental to their family members especially if they have young children at home. Therefore I believe that smoking in public should still be allowed as long as it is done in designated areas. Perhaps restaurants could allocate a smoking area for such purposes.
