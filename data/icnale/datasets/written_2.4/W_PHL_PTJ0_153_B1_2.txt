Due to certain pressures of college life, there have been circumstances that make college students think that it is important to have part time jobs. However, I think otherwise. There is no special need for a college student to have a part time job unless they have no other choice. A reason for this is because they can negotiate with others to gain certain privileges or achieve goals. For instance, if a student wants to be more independent or want to try to become more mature, the individual can always negotiate with his or her parents. He or she should negotiate regarding the limits of his or her freedom and the amount of allowance to be provided such that there is no need to be too dependent on the student's parents. If the need for a part time job arises due to the lack money, the student can always try to budget with he or she has and study and work hard to obtain a scholarship. The individual should only acquire a part time job if he or she is truly left with no other choice. After all, a part time job can put quite the toll on one's studies.
