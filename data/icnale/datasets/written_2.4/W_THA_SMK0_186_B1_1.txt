Cigarettes are made from tobacco grown in everywhere around the world. Most of countries grant the factories to produce cigarettes. A lot of profits both government and enterprise earned each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for smokers and non-smokers will be equal or even worse for their health. Smoking can cause cancer and many other symptoms. Smoke in public places such as public parks, bus stops or in the streets which are in the open areas cause harmful effect to health for both smokers and non-smokers who presents in the areas. If smokers smoke in the closed area such as in the theater, house, restaurant, air plane, etc. It will cause more danger because both smokers and non-smokers will be easily harmed by smoke. Restaurants are the place where people come to enjoy their foods and drinks especially with their families. Smoking could ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to health of all people around them. The air conditioner in restaurants will make it even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes, because there is no air ventilates to get rid of all smoke and it will be in their breath and to all lungs of people. Government, especially ministry of public health must realize about the health of people and establish the law against smoking in the restaurants both non-air condition and air condition to keep people away from smoke of cigarettes. I strongly recommend that smoking should be completely banded at all restaurants in the country.
