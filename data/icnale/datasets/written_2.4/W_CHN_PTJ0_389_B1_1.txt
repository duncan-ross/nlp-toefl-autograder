I agree with the statement that having a part-time job is important to college students. My reasons are as follow. First of all, having a part-time job can teach us a lot through practice. As is known to all, our 4 years in college is a precious period in our life, during which we should not only learn how to study, but also learn about how to do. Compared with the academic activities like holding lectures, discussions or debates which aims to improve our learning skills, the do part has been largely ignored on the campus, though it is agreed that the latter one counts more when we step into society. Under these circumstances, it is the best choice that we take a part-time job outside the school. Second, when we are getting the experience, we also get paid. In some countries, students are already economically independent from their parents when they step into the university, but we are not. With a part-time job, we can get some burdens off our parents by using our own-earned money. Moreover, we can taste the pleasure of earning ahead of those without a part-time job. Third, we can get into another circle of people called the workmates. Unlike schoolmates and roommates you share joy with, workmates are those who work hard with you. You conquer difficulties together, and that would cultivate special feelings which you would probably value in a lifetime. In conclusion, having a part-time job can benefit us a lot without taking up too much time. So it's important and beneficial for students to get one in their college years.
