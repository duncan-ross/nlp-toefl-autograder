I agree with this idea to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country because smoking does not good for health. It is not only destroys the people who smoke but it also destroys the people who stay around. It has bad smell and many poisons in the smoke and you will have a problem with your lung. And if another people have breathe it, they will have a problem with their lung too. For me I really hate smoking and do not like the people who smoke. I want to tell them that "Do not hurt me from your smoke. " And I think that we must to ban it from the university too. Smoking does not important for anyone life, everybody can choose their way. They can choose that they will smoke or not. I think, It does not important to has smoking area in the restaurant because I think when you come into the restaurant you want to eat something, you do not go to the restaurant for smoking. Is it right? And why we have to smoke at the restaurant. It does not have any reason to smoke. So I think it is the best idea to do.
