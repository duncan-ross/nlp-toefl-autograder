I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The benefits of the ban would outweigh the cons very much in my opinion, thus making this an effective ban. Smoking causes harm to those who smokes, and to others round them who are exposed to second-hand smoking. We should not endanger the lives of others when they did not choose to smoke personally. Since restaurants are not our private homes or spaces, we should take into account other people's presence. Hence, to protect them, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only is it a health hazard, it can also be a negative externality due to other external costs imposed upon other non-smokers. We could, for example, talk about the smell which is a turn-off to most non-smokers. Or that cigarettes butts are usually littered at smoking areas, polluting the environment. Furthermore, the smoke in the air can also be considered as air pollution (Okay, I sort of mentioned the smoke as a health hazard already). In other words, I feel strongly that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the betterment of most, if not all, in the society.
