Not until entered college did I start to work on a part-time job. When I was in junior and senior high schools, my father insisted that student should concentrate on study so he protested me to work on my way. However, after I have entered college, I have more free time to do what I want. Moreover, my school is pretty far away from my hometown so that I live in the dormitory. I am free to manage my time and living. In order to fill the free times among my courses, I apply a part time job in the office of English Department. The pay for the job is 95 dollars per hour. It is not much but the work is very easy and the amount of work is light. The direct advantage of working part-time is having extra money. With the money, I can buy more goods I want to such as books, clothes and cosmetics. When I am out with my friends, I don't need to ask money from my parents. After all, money is not the only good point for this job. I also learn how to operate printer and computers more precisely. It is important to set up good relationships with other coworkers in the office and to cooperate with different kinds of people in this job.
