If you are a college student, you are interested in a part-time job. As a college student, you are adult but you depend on your parents financially. That's the why you want to have a part-time job. Although I do not have any experience about part-time job, I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I think a part-time job can help college students experience the social life early. It is not long since students became the adult. So they need to have more experiences for their psychological maturity. A part-time job can be the best experience that helps students adjusts the real world. Second, I think a part-time job can improve student's independence. In Korea, many college students get an allowance form their parents. However, this can be not helpful to both students and parents. Students try to read their parents' mind because parents cover all the expenses that include tuition and allowances. And parents also have a burden because of money. Having a part-time job can be the best solution. And part-time job also help them improve independence. In conclusion, I think a part-time job is important and necessary to college students because of experiencing social life and improving independence. Actually I also do not experience a part-time job. In this winter vacation, I plan to have a part-time job for improving my independence.
