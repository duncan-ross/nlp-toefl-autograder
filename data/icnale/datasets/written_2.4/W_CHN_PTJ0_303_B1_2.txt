Nowadays higher education is more and more popularized. We college students get much more pressure than before. Many students think getting a part-time job to prepare themselves to the complexity of society is very necessary. However I do not think so. In my opinion, it is not very important for us to get a part-time job. Firstly college students' main purpose to enter a college is to study more knowledge. Colleges have a lot of resources which are not accessible to people who have already graduated. College students should treasure the opportunity and focus on their study. Secondly most part-time jobs are very easy and boring, for example tutor, cleaner, seller and so on. Students can not get much useful working experiences but a little money which can't support themselves at all. In fact it's a waste of time. Thirdly if students want to get more social experiences, they can not only join in some communities but also do some social investigations to extend the horizon. They needn't waste large amount of time to do part-time jobs.. All in all college students are burdened with a lot of social responsibilities. Some of them are supposed to be scientists, some of them are supposed to become academicians. part-time jobs are not so important
