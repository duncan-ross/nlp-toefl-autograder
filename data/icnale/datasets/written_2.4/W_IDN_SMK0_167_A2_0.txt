Therefore, smoking should be banned, especially if they are in public places like restaurants. As we know most of the restaurants provide a special room for smoking-called smoking area. This is intended to not disturb other visitors who do not like smoking. Usually these areas are ventilated directly connected to the outside so as not to spread and disrupt other. But better still if the room did not exist anymore because in addition to making room in need of money that not a few also in the presence of a smoking ban then the visitors are indirectly forced to not smoke. Should smoking completely banned in all restaurants in Indonesia because the country is very dangerous for smokers and for those who inhale the cigarette smoke.
