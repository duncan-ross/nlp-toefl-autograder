Before entering college, I never had a chance to do part-time job. I want to do part-time job because it is helpful for us to learn more actually things, but not these knowledge's which were wrote in books, and did not change for many years. Another advantage of part-time job appealing me to is money. When I can make money by myself, but not ask for my parents, I feel very happy. At the same time, with the help of this money, I can do many things I want to do conveniently. Two months after I was a college student, I got a precious chance to take part in a part-time job. It was working in the China Telephone Company. I was very happy and try my best to do all things better. The greatest meaning of this job for me is not money, not practical experience, not a reason to spend my free time, but making more friends. When working together, we were talking about many interesting things. At that time, I was a freshman in college, so most of them were very favorable with me. Whenever I was facing difficulties, they would help me without any condition. Till now, I am working with them. We are just like a family, full of happiness and smile.
