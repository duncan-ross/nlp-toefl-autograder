In the 21st century, modern parents are always spoiling their kids and even as they grow older, they will always be a kid from their parent's point of view. I certainly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. As we are older, we should learn to be more independent and not too often rely on our parents for money nor protection. It is all part and puzzle of growing up that we will have to work sooner or later, thus why not get an experience out of it earlier? There is this phrase whereby "not everything can be learnt in the classroom", hence to learn more things, one should experience it themselves and therefore, working part time job might not be a bad idea after all. Furthermore, college students should learn how to manage their time, stress, studies and work well to be a better manager of themselves. This will encourage them to be young adults and taking up responsible and not running away from hardship so they will be well groomed in the future and not being afraid of hardship and also better understanding of their parents slogging out for their child's future. In conclusion, I agree to the statement.
