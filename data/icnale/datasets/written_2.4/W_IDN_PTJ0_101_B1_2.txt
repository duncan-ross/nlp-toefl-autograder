Most young teenagers and adult teenagers in modern counties have part time jobs nowadays. Some even have more than one. I found three main reasons why part time jobs have become important for young people today. The first reason is to earn money. In modern country, parents generally do not spend a lot of money for their teenager children. They have to earn their own money in order to continue their study and feed themselves. For instance, most students in USA go to college in the morning and work after school. They work as cashier, shop keeper, or an employee at a restaurant. The second reason is to get experience. To be able to get a better job in the future, young people need to be more experienced and skilled. They start their carrier from a low position so that while they graduate, they can be promoted to a higher position, or they can apply for another better job that requires similar skill. For example, an ex-cashier might apply for a job in a bank as a teller, and he will be easily accepted because he has already had the experience on handling money. The last reason why part time jobs are important is to build network. While doing their part time jobs, it is possible for them to meet other people who might be their future business partners, customers, or even future spouses. For example, they who work as a shop keeper have the opportunity to meet other people. And those people might be a potential friend or partner in the future. In conclusion, part time jobs are essential for young people to earn money, to get experiences, and to build network. With a part time job, a student can feed himself, have more experience, and get more friends.
