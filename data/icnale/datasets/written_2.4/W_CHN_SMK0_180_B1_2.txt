Nowadays, the number of smokers is increasing. More and more people have the habit of smoking. They say that it can help them relax themselves. So the phenomenon is becoming more and more common. As a result, more and more people smoke everywhere, even in restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Following are some reasons of my opinion. Firstly, the behavior of smoking in restaurant can not give others the good impression when they meet you for the first time. Maybe, smoking is necessary for some business, but as for me, the image is not good. And when we are in restaurant, the restaurant is a public place for many people. It may have bad influence. Secondly, smoking in restaurant will pollute the clean air. Restaurant is a place for dinner, and inevitably a number of people will feel annoyed by the smoke. Last but not least, non-smokers in the restaurant will breathe the harmful air if smoking is allowed. This affects their rights. From my perspective, it is an offensive behavior of smoking in restaurant. Many restaurants in our country haven't taken measures to ban the smoking. So, we should try our best to carry on the plan to ban smoking at all the restaurant in the country.
