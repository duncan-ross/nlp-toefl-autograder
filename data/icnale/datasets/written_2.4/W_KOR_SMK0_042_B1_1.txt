I agree this statement. Smoking is potential killing. All adult is not smoke. Restaurant is all people are going to spot. Of course, smoking area is existed. But that is banned all smoke. Indirect smoking is smoking. Smell influences to people. Child is too short, adult is without think blow cigar smoke is bad influence. All restaurants are no measures to don't smoker. But restaurants are opposite this statement. That's why sales are fall. But restaurants think that positive efficient. Opposite smoking are many family customers and woman customers. Many people is agreement this statement. Going to eat out, smoke is come to the table; children think awful smell and block the nose. Cigar is favorite food not drug. But public place is banned. That is thinking others. Restaurant is eating a food, not smoke. Not endure smoke, going to the home. Of course you are alone. Some people are smoke confidence. That is wrong idea. Restaurant owner is think that one people smoke is influences all people in the restaurant. Right now employee is suffered from smoke. Employee is suffered from disease finally damage is returning the owner. Most important thing is reduce fire risk. Not smoking in the restaurant is nice and fresh place.
