We always face these scenes that a girl persuading her boyfriend out of smoking in our daily life. It becomes a common sense that we shouldn't't allow the people we care to smoke. So I hold the idea that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in the country. As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health, and we know that a number of persons died at an energetic age because of smoking. Many people want to get rid of the addiction to smoke while they just couldn't control themselves. Then, our government must help. The policy that keeps smoking out of our restaurants will be absolutely welcomed. Also, restaurants are public places where we must take others' rights into consideration. There's no reason forcing others who don't want to smoke especially children to get second-hand smoke. Finally, maybe not many people know the fact that smoking also decreases our desire to eat. That's why smokers always look sick and lack of nutrition. Anyway, we come to restaurant to have a feast and we can't tolerate those delicious food wasted. I think the landlord will be no happier because you consume more and keep a better environment in the restaurant.
