I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for health, and even more so for second-hand smoke. For the benefit of non-smokers, Singapore currently bans smoking in all indoor, air-conditioned establishments, such as restaurants, shopping malls, corporate buildings, etc. Even for the non-air-conditioned areas like the hawker centres, almost the entire premise is banned from smoking, except for a small corner which is designated for smoking. The ban of smoking at all the restaurants in the country will help to alleviate the negative effects of second-hand smoke faced by non-smokers, and discourages the smokers to smoke, as it is made inconvenient for them to do so. The ban might, initially, be faced with objections from smokers, as it will be inconvenient for them to smoke, but in the long run, will be beneficial for themselves as well as the society as a whole. In addition to the ban in all restaurants, campaigns could be carried to advocate the harmful effects of smoking to discourage smoking and helps smokers to stop smoking. In the long run, besides the restaurants, the ban could cover more areas like those covered in Singapore. For the ban to be effective, the penalties and enforcement have to be appropriately carried out as well.
