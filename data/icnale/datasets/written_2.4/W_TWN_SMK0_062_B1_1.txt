Most of countries in the world allow her people smoke in the public, so do my county before. Nowadays, my country bans the people smoking in the public even the restaurants. At first, some people against this law strongly, still now, but some one change their mind. In my opinion: to me, a person doesn't smoke at all, I think it's correct in banning the smoking in the restaurants or in the public. There are some reasons: First, smoking is bad of people's health even the people who don't smoke just stay around. Second, according the reports, smoking people or the people often stay in the space full of smoke, all of them usually died in lung cancer. Third, smoking makes our mouths smell bad and also may cause us can't tasty the flavor from food. Finally, a lot of people now don't smoke. If someone smokes, that person would have difficult to make friends with others. In the end, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Although, this rule may sound too serious and have hard to achieve, this rule would make us live longer and healthier. At all, we all hope we have a beauty life.
