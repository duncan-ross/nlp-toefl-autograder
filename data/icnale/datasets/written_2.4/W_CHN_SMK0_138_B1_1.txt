I am in favor of the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because some reasons listed below. First, no-smoking can show respect for others. Restaurants are public places in which there must be many people who are non-smoking or even hate the smoke of cigarettes. If you don't want to be blamed by others or spoil your image, you'd better get rid of your addictions to cigarettes. Second, the restaurant is a place to enjoy delicacies rather than cigarettes, so it is just not the right place for someone to light his cigarettes. Though I am non-smoking, I don't think it will be more delicious to eat with a cigarette or two. Third, as is known to all, smoking will do harm to our health. In that case, a total ban on smoking in a restaurant is a way to limit the number of cigarettes for heavy smokers, though the number can be limited is very small. In conclusion, restaurants are places where fresh air is needed and the smell of cigarettes will spoil the appetite of most guests. So, it is a reasonable measure to forbid smoking there. So let the government do something from now on to ban it.
