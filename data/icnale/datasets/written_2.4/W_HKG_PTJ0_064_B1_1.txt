Some people said that it is not suitable for secondary school students to have a part time job, but how about university student? I answer is absolutely yes, because part time job can help the students' self-development. A part time job can help students to gain work experiences, which are exceedingly important for university students. Nowadays, employers always ask their employees if they have any work experiences, if they do have, then the chances of getting a better job would increase. A part time job is not just help the students to broaden their working horizons, but also give them chances to learn how to manage their money. University students get salaries from their part time job, so they can decide how to spend their money, consume it or save it into banks? This can be a challenging questions for them, how to use money in a proper way? This is a good chance for university students to work their own strategies out. Some people may say that a part time job can really disturb students' academic performance, but I dare say it is all about time management skills, if a person has a better time management skills, he can absolutely handle a part time job without developing a disastrous academic results. Part time job can benefit students a lot, we should support university students to have part time job.
