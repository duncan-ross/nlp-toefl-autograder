I agree with this topic. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in everywhere because I hate to be a second smoker who receives smoke from the first smoker. That is unfair for people who do not smoke. But it is impossible to banned in everywhere because everyone has a right to do everything in law. Smokers have their rights to smoke in the place that is for smoking. Back to the restaurant, I think smoking in restaurants must be banned because smoke can make people upset and it can decrease the good smell of food. When people go to restaurant, they want to eat good food in good scenery. It is not fair if the good scenery will be damaged by the smoker. I think government should do more than ban because it is not the best way to solve the problem. Some smokers do not care and they break the law without realizing. Government ought to start a campaign for smokers to make them know that where they can smoke and government have to help them if they want to stop smoking. I think if government can stop people from smoking by telling them the disadvantage of smoking.
