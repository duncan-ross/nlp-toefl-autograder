I agree that it's important, but just not very practical these days. I understand that a lot of kids are doing it hard and struggling financially. However I think that they would be better off spending ninety-five percent of their time on studying. The reason that I think that is because jobs are hard enough to get now as it is and there are loads of people down at the local employment centre every week day now who have families to feed. Throwing more competition for them, like groups of students looking for part-time jobs, only makes it harder because a lot of companies will see a chance to get some cheap college labour rather than having to pay adult rates to older individuals. This may sound rather strange coming from a teacher and I understand the student's position, but I also understand the current economy too. If it comes down to prioritizing, then I think that we must keep the wage earners, who have to support their families, in mind first. On the other side of the coin, I know that a lot of students are fairly resilient and tenacious so, I think that they will still fair well. I certainly believe that their grades would improve and in the long run, provide them with better and more rewarding employment.
