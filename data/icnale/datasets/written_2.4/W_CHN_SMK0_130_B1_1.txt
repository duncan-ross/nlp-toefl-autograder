 As we all know, nowadays smoking is banned at some restaurants in the country so that those smokers are no longer allowed to smoke in these public places. In my opinion, smoking is not a healthy behavior. And this new rule is good because that banning smoking improve people' health. Smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. What is worst, when those smokers are able to smoke in these public places, they can also make others sick. But others just could not force smokers to stop smoking until smokers realize their behavior will bring harm to others. However, there are few smokers pay attention to it. Therefore; it is unfair to those nonsmokers to get sick. When banning smoking in public buildings, it will please those nonsmokers. And now with this new rule, smokers have few opportunities to smoke so that it will also improve their health. Also, less smoking in public can do good to our environment. In public places, the harm of smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. However, those smokers say that it takes away some of their right and freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If someone wants to smoke, there are also some private places allowed. Therefore, smokers will choose to smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have their freedom of smoking. In a word, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us.
