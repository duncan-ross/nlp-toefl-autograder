 Nowadays, more and more university students go out to find part time jobs on the weekends. Some people think that students can't do this because students should focus on their studies. However, other people support this behavior, because they think the job can give their good experience to adapt the society. Different people have different ideas. Some people don't agree this because students should pay more attention to their study. If they spend time doing part time jobs, their studies will drop. In addition they can gain living expenses from their parents; they don't have to earn money relying on part time jobs. Thirdly they will have less time to have a rest and feel tired if it takes much time to have a part time job. Other people support that students should find a part time job when they are in the university because they have much free time to do some part time jobs. Students should get much experience in the society. They can go out for part time jobs on the weekends. And the part time jobs can make our life meaningful and beautiful. For example, a student in our class, she often takes part time jobs on the weekends, but she makes full use of time to study at weekdays. In my opinion, students should take part time jobs on the true time. It is good to our future. However students should pay more attention to studying than take part time jobs.
