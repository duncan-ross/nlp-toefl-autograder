Some students say that they have problems at school because of the amount of workload that clashes with their part time job. However, they don't think of dropping their job so that they can have more time to study and achieve better grades. There are students who are paying for their own tuition fees and housing fees because their family cannot support them. For these students, it is a requirement to earn money or else they would not be studying here. However, an interesting thing is that it is usually these students who can maintain good grades while having a job at the same time. The students who do complain are usually the ones who are being supported by their parents. These students get a job to earn some extra cash so that they can satisfy their own materialistic needs. If we look at the students who are being supported by their parents, we would see that most of them don't spend a huge amount of time on studying or their work. Most of their time (and money) will be spent on socializing on Facebook or MSN and devices that can support those functions such as the Iphone4 or the HTC EVO smart-phones. I think that students who are being supported by their parents should not have a part time job because it is not necessary. If they cannot handle their workload at school, then they should give up their part time job to give them more time and less pressure.
