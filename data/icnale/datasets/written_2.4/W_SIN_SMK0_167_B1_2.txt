Smoking itself has been portrayed to us as a negative externality, not just to the smoker himself but also to the people around him and his environment. Despite all the consequences, smoking is nonetheless present, and we have to acknowledge the presence of smokers. If that is so, why ban smoking in all the restaurants? Are we condemning their actions, or are we restricting them in some ways, although we might not have the rights to control them? In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This perspective is also supported by the government for they have since banned smoking in most public places, and having designated smoking areas for smokers. Although it is unfair for smokers to be restricted because no one has a right over them even if they are a minority, but the very fact that their actions causes harm not just to them but the people around them makes it more justified because then, their individual choice of smoking does not just affect themselves. However, we acknowledge the needs of smokers and often smokers include high profile professionals who have high disposable income. Smoking could be an avenue for them to de-stress. Given that the target audience of restaurants include these people who are affluent, it would not be fair to ban smoking at restaurants because the venue might be for a social affair. Smoking amongst business executives and colleagues could also be a social affair. Hence, I feel that the decision to have designated smoking areas is prudent because it takes into account the concerns of both smokers and non-smokers.
