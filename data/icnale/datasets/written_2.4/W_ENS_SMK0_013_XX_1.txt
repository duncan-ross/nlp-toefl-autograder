I don't think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Although I have never been there, smoking has been illegal in my home state in restaurants since I was a kid. I am a smoker, and I feel that I should have the right to smoke anywhere I want to. Smoking is especially satisfying after a good meal, in much the same way as a good cup of coffee a satisfying after a good desert. I don't understand why anyone thinks they have the right to tell me what I can or cannot do in a public place. I think that many smokers will be upset if smoking is banned at all the restaurants because to them it is just as much a part of the experience as a meal itself. Having to go outside just to have a cigarette is a huge pain, and if the nonsmokers really care that much maybe they shouldn't go to restaurants. Most restaurants have a nonsmoking section anyway, so I really don't see the problem. The bottom line is that people should be free to do whatever they want to do as long as that does not affect other people.
