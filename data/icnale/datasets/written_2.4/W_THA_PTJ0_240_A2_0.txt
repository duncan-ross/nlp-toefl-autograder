I am agreeing because a past-time job is the thing is important for students because student can practice ability, can work with other people together and being experience of live. Moreover, they can low piece with your mother and your father a lot. When student doing part time job they will have money. When they want to buy thing their can give money yourself for buy everything such as food, cloth, medicine, and other etc. If you have money you can go around the world such as go to see kangaroo at the Australia, go to see Thachmahan at India, go to buy bag at London, go to breath at Thailand and meet new friend. This is advantage of past-time job. Therefore, a past time job is a lot important for student and it can help your parents for money to used every day. And if you do part-time job you will have a lot of experience so you can practice for your work in the future. So if you want to have money and experience for work you must doing past-time very hard and a lot. I think that thing is you need it do not so far for you.
