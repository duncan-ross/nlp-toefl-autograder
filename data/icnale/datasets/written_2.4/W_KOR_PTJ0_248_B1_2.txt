In many countries, college students have a part-time job and it is relatively common and encouraged in western counties compared to Korea. In fact, some people think that it is not much important than studying and they may be getting distracted from academic learning. However, I do not agree with these opinions for several reasons below. First, college students get independent economically from their parents by earning money themselves. Korean students tend to be very dependent on their parents, especially, in a financial aspect. This is one of the reasons that young people in Korea are lack of managing difficulties in their lifetime by comparison with people in other countries. Even if a part-time job is not high salary, it is more important for college students to raise their independence in broad perspective. Second, it helps college students to get practical abilities that are hard to learn from a school. Academic learning tends not to be really practical to apply for living a life. It is mainly because of the difference between the climates of a school and a workplace. For example, it is not acceptable to make a mistake at work, because if it keeps happening, people get fired in the end. For this reason, students are needed to be more careful and responsible to take care of many rules than just being a student. Consequently, they acquire useful and practical abilities by doing a part-time job, and it also helps them to work more efficiently when they start working after graduation. I'm convinced that having a part-time job is also important for their future, and so we primarily need to make a better working climate for students and encourage them to experience it.
