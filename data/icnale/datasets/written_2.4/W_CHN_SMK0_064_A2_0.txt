According to the scientists, we know that smoking is a factor of lung cancer, but is it necessary to ban smoking in all the restaurants over the country? To be honest, I think so. First of all, smoking may kill smokers gradually. The nicotine must be the murder. Smoking may makes smoker constantly cough and it can't be stopped, both smokers and their families have to tolerate their cough for a long time. If they are not lucky enough to defend themselves from cancer, their family have to face a tough future and take care of them. Then, have the smokers even thought about the people surrounding them? While they smoking, other are forced to have second-hand smoking. Everyone do thing and affect others. They can make people surrounding them fell sick, can't enjoy a meal, especially the children, they haven't grown up, nicotine will make a damage to their young bodies and their brains. Smoking in restaurant may make others sick more quickly. The smoke will spread around the whole restaurant. People have to get touch with the pollution through foods and drink. So, don't smoke in restaurant is everyone's responsibility. But if they don't agree, government should do things to ban smoking in all the restaurants.
