Smoking is a rather harmful and otherwise seemingly stupid habit, but it is very common in the UK. If it is as common in Japan as it is in the UK, I think the Japanese restaurants would be hard pressed to go about completely banning smoking in all of the restaurants. The tobacco industry has a long history and is additionally quite a large business, so it would also be apprehensive to allow any rules that would cut into its profits. From the standpoint of health, however, it is absolutely a good idea to ban smoking in restaurants. I feel especially bad for the little tikes who have to breathe and their mummy's or daddy's cigarette smoke, and there are also more likely to get sick compared to an adult. For the sake of the children, why don't we encourage smokers to be a little bit more thoughtful and their choices of avenues to enjoy a puff, and furthermore, why don't we encourage nonsmokers to seek restaurants where they will not be as likely to encounter cigarette smoke. This way, everybody wins, and the state of affairs does not have to change too much. Solutions like this are often the most popular any ways.
