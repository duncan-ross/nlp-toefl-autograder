Nowadays, with the high pace of the society and the improvement of living standard, people get better education. Universities and colleges take in more and more students. On the one hand, more people have access of further education, but on the other hand, the opportunity of getting a good job largely decreases. It's more common for a college student to have a part-time job than ever, partly because they can make money to support the family, make more friends, and maybe mostly because it can increase their experience and let them adapt to their occupations and the society more quickly after graduation. There exists a wide debate that whether the college students should have a part-time job for the sake of getting possible working experience. The opponents hold the opinion that it will do harm to their study and their future career. On contrast, it is more widely accepted that it is important to do so but not necessarily. If the students does well enough in his studying, and have extra energy, seeking a part-time job can surely help him succeed in the future. But pay attention, the results differs in different situations. If he or she has trouble even in basic studying process, spending so much time in jobs is obviously unnecessary. After all, as a student, no matter in primary school or in college, it is more important to learn. All in all, whether to have a part-time job depends on specific situation. But the significance of a part-time job can hardly be ignored.
