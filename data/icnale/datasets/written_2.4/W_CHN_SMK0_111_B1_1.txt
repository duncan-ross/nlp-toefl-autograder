I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons as follows. On the one hand, smoking itself does harm to people's health. The harmful substance which comes from cigarettes is not only bad for the smoker himself but also for the people around the smoker. A survey indicates that the person who smokes a lot has a higher risk of getting lung cancer which huge amounts of people die of every year. Besides the smoker, the people around the smoker also take in the poisonous gas into their lungs. So their health is threatened. On the other hand, restaurant is a public place. Everyone should take other's feeling into consideration. If someone smokes in a restaurant, the others will be affected. Because the smoke destroys the environment, it will probably affect other's appetite. Everyone is a part of the society, so it's our duty to think for others. So when we are in a public place, we should behave ourselves and be polite. What you do reflects your moral level. In general, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Do you agree with me?
