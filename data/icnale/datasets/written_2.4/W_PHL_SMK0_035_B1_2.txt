Ever since, we people are very informed as to the damages that smoking can cause to our body. Because of these damages, when someone smokes, approximately a minute is lessening from his life. When one smoke, it does not only damage their body but their entire system. In fact, the drawbacks of smoking are much more harmful to the people who can inhale the smoke than to the ones who are actually using the cigarettes. This is why I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants in general. Restaurants are supposed to be kept clean and appealing to the customers because it is where delicious food is served. Just think of how you will feel if say, you are eating and suddenly someone smokes beside you. The food that was once sumptuous to the customers will be less appetizing. Moreover, I think that owners should implement a non-smoking or smoking-free environment in their restaurants for the customers to not be tempted to smoke anymore. Also, they should also be very strict in implementing the rule regarding NO SMOKING so that others will not use it as an excuse to smoke all they want when they are in a restaurant.
