I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is still allowed at many Australian restaurants, and this is one thing that I really hate about my home country. Most of the restaurants here have already banned smoking, and this makes it much more pleasant and enjoyable to have a night out with your friends or with their family because you don't have to worry about the cigarette smoke. I also think that it will enhance the image of the restaurant to ban smoking and makes it seem higher class. If Japan were to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the entire country, I think that that would make Japan look pretty classy too. Also, there are the many negative effects of smoking including lung cancer, decreased lifespan, and many other symptoms. Smoker's cough is also one of the nastiest things to hear, and it also looks quite painful. The less people that have to deal with that, the better. As human beings we should always be trying to improve our culture and our way of life so that our children and our children's children will have a better world in which to live. Continuing to allow smoking in restaurants does not allow us to do anything along these lines.
