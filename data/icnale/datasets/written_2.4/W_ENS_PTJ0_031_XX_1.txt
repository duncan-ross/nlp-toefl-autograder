I love my part-time job. I work as an assistant at the local San Diego zoo, and in my work I get to do all sorts of interesting things with all sorts of interesting animals. For example, last week I learned how to feed the alligators, and at first I was very scared, but my supervisor taught me that if you treat animals with respect they will treat you with respect as well. This was a very interesting lesson that I think not a lot of people have the opportunity to learn, and I think that in the same way I was able to learn something very unique and interesting through my part-time job, there are a lot of other college students who learned a lot of other very interesting and unique things through their part-time jobs as well. It really isn't about the money because you don't get paid very much when you work part time, but the knowledge you can gain will be very valuable in your future, so I think that students are not wasting their time if they find part time jobs. If other students can find a part-time job as rewarding as I find mine, I think that all college students should have part-time jobs.
