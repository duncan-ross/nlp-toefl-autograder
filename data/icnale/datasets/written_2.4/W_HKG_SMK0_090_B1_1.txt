Healthy is one of the most important problem people concern. Smoking is really bad for people life. Although it is not good, there are many people like smoking. Those people who smoke should think if they keep smoking or not. Government set some rules to discipline smoking in Hong Kong. I do not think set some rules is useful to change people smoking behave. People have the right to do anything as they want. It is better to teach their how dangerous smoking is rather than discipline them to smoke. I believe that it is the best way to improve the smoking behave in Hong Kong. Cancer can be due to smoking. Beside, smoking is not only bad to smoker but also bad to the people around them. Therefore, smoking problem is not only the problem of smoker but also danger to their relatives even us. If they keep smoking, our healthy will be affected by them. In my point of view, smoking problem is relative to our life but not only smoker themselves. Therefore, they have to think is smoking necessary for them.
