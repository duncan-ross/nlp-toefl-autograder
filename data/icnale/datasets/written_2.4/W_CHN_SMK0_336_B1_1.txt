It's reported that more and more cities ban public smoking. I can't agree it more actually. When we are on a bus, in a supermarket or even in a bar, we would feel disgusted even if only couples of people are smoking. Flating smoke surrounding me always make me cough and hard to breathe, so I really hate people who smoke on public regardless of the others. As a matter of fact, the harm from a public smoker is far more than making people sick. According to many scientific surveys, people near a smoker will smoke second-handly, which does more harm even than the original smokers! So it's never too early too take actions to ban public smoking. Futher more, the poisonous gas can pollute the whole air, which makes our environment worse. And lastly, smoking is a really bad habit itself, so NO PUBLIC SMOKING may help those smokers keep away cigarette to some degree. Sometimes district rules are much more convincing than tender advice, you know. In a word, every minute counts on the way to put NO PUBLIC SMOKING into practice.
