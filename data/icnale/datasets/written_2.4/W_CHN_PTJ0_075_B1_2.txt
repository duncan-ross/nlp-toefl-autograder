It's important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, we can get some money for our usually life. Maybe that won't be much useful. But our excitement for getting our own money will always be here. Comparing to earning money, the way to gain experience will be more important. As we all know, when we are interviewed in finding jobs after we graduate, a necessarily question will be asked that "whether do you have working experience?" Maybe, some of you will say that in many chances, college students usually do some labor jobs which are far away with their majors and these jobs will do never help to their future jobs. But, in another view, does the experience in the interviewer's mouth only mean the one in their major jobs? I don't think so. As far as I'm concerned, the experience during our students touching the society will also be our wealth. Earlier for us to enter society better will we know the complexity of it and better we will do in our future jobs. For most students, the college life is more relax than our high-school life. The reality tells us that more and more students are addicted to computer games during their college life. If they have a part-time job, the responsibility and the use of their time will help them to get out of these useless activities.
