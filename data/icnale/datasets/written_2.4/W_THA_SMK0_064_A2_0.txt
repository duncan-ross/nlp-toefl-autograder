I agree with smoking should not allow in restaurant. Smoking destroy smoker and people everyone around. If someone smoke, the health will have many bad sides such as a disease, cancer in lungs and still destroy person health who live in same location. I see many people around smoke in public area and in restaurant. They smoke in university too. It no good to smoke. If punishment for smokers, it is good. Smoking still consume expenses unreasonably to make people easy to die. They have a little time to stay. A person who smoke cigarettes is not good personality in other eyes, a person around stare at and think they are not good. They are not good to follow. But many kid like to follow them because kid think it is cool but it is bad idea. So who to smoke cigarettes then should quit to smoke. It is the good idea for them and for person around them. I agree smoking should not allow in everywhere. It is bad smell and no benefit to smoke. But if the restaurant want people to smoke, the restaurant must make a corner for smoker. Tell them to smoke in the corner and away from, anyone don't smoke. It is okay to do.
