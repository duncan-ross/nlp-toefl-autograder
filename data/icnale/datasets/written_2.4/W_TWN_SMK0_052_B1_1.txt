I totally agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons why I agree are: The restaurants are supposed to be places where offer people great environment and services to have dishes. The smokers should stand in other peoples' shoes; the damage smoke is not they want. In the restaurants, there may be a lot of people including woman who pregnant. Smoking is really could be a damage to her and her baby. Besides, smoking could be a serious damage to our health and the people around you. If you are think you are a great father, you support your family and let your family have a smooth life, you have two little cute children, you have a beautiful wife and she is pregnant... etc, but you have a bad habit---smoking!!! Then you should think much deeper. You possibly get lung cancer after years, the damage of cancer make you have to stay on bed and couldn't work... last, you have no money to afford your family to have a normal life. Next, the second-smoke full of your house, your children, pregnant wife, are all influenced by it. And it cause a serious damage to their body... After picturing your future life, do you really want to smoke now? Finally, the restaurants are public places; the smokers should learn to stop smoking in pubic places. Or there are some pubic places have set a special space for smokers, they should follow the rules.
