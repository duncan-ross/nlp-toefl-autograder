Tuition fee in college is seriously high. Not every college student can afford to go to expensive school or even go to universities. Some of them maybe struggle to make money for them to go to college/universities because of the financial state of their family. Even though there are some state universities that offer lesser tuition fee but still they need to have allowance for their expenses. Maybe this is the reason why some college students look for a part-time job. It is important for some college students to have a part-time job that will help them to have income so they can afford going to school every day. This said job is also a training for us. Having a job like this is really not easy especially to those college students; they might be having difficulty in balancing their time because they have to spare time for their jobs and also for their studies. They're doing this thing just to pursue what they really want even if it takes them to work at their young age. There will be times that you can't do your school works because you're very exhausted in your work and vice versa. But the good thing about students having part-time jobs, are they're becoming more responsible than those who aren't. Having a job can enhance our different personality. Our interpersonal skill will be developed and this skill is an important factor when having a job. College students working in a part-time job are experiencing things that ordinary students haven't experienced yet and I salute them for that. Let us not look down to those students who works so that they can afford going to universities because think of it, they help our economy as well as they help themselves to survive their everyday lives.
