College is the time where independence is often sought. Where a sense of freedom and self-sustainment is like a breath of fresh air on a prisoner's face after the granting of his parole. That is why more often than not, college students find part-time jobs to help finance their education. They take on backbreaking jobs not only to get their paycheques but also have a sense of fulfilment. It is often experienced in the Western culture that students fend for themselves after stepping in to college. They are expected to generate money for themselves. Having part-time jobs can also pave the way for the student's professional practices. This can shape the individual into a person who is well-rounded even before he/she steps into the professional world. Thus, having part-time jobs may be helpful to students in a sense that it can be training grounds for the betterment of the individuals. As a freshman in college, I have not yet fully experience the life college has to offer including their string of part-time jobs. I would want to experience working part time just for the heck of it and possibly acquire information that I can apply later on in my professional life.
