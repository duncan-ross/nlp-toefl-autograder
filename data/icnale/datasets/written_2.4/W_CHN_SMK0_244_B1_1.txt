 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Smoking is harmful to human beings, especially in public. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in the country. Smoking at the restaurant may cause the problems below. Of course, the mainly problem is that smoking not only do harm to the man who smokes, but also have a bad effect on the neighbors. When one smokes, the smoke will be filled fully in the whole room, and can hardly be given off. When the others absorb it, they will suffer from the serious damage. What's more? The guests will be disturbed that they can't enjoy the meal happily. The other problem is that smoking may cause a big fire. As we all know, a restaurant should be very dry everywhere, for example carpet. If one smokes and he is careless, it's very easy to start a fire, then the result can't be predicted. Taking all people's safety into account, smoking in the restaurant is a large danger to all, so it should be banned. Small mistakes can lead to a large accident. In order to take care of our body and in case of a fire. , smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.
