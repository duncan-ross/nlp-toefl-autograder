Many students these days take up a part-time job in order to earn some extra pocket money for themselves. Youngsters these days have extremely high expenditure, and a part-time job would allow them to support their high cost of living. This is especially common during the long school holidays. Secondary school students would resort to being waitresses at restaurants, or even help out at IT fairs. Junior College students and undergraduates, on the other hand, are more commonly known to take up tuition assignments. For some undergraduates, taking up a part-time job even becomes a necessity, as the tuition fees for universities are extremely costly. However, it would be less of a necessity for college students as the school fees are still heavily subsidized by the government. There are pros and cons of taking up a part-time job. For instance, taking up tuition assignments is a good source of income with a flexible timing, however, this would also mean having to give up the time that could otherwise be spent on studying or doing projects. Students should weigh the pros and cons of taking up a part-time job. Earning extra income to support their expenses would indeed lessen their parents' burden, however, this should not come at the expense of their grades and studies. Afterall, students being students should still put their studies as top priority. Therefore, it is good that college students take up a part-time job, but it is definitely not as important as the focus they should place on their studies.
