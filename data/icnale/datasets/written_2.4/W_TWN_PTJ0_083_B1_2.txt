I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are a lot of advantages for college students having a part-time job. First, if students had a part-time job, he should face a lot of people that he would not face in the college. It could help them experience how to talk with different people. Second, having a part-time job for students could let them know it is realistic in the society. In the college, if you made a mistake, other people must forgive you. Maybe teachers would help you settle it. But in the society, if you made a mistake, you should settle it by yourself. And maybe your boss would not forgive you as easier as other people when you in the college. Although you should do something for your mistake yourself, it could make you be independent. Also you could learn something by these mistakes. It could make you grow up. Third, if college students had a part-time job, they must experience many kinds of jobs. They experience a job, maybe would find they is not suit it. Then they would change their job, and they could know what kind of job is their rights choose. Finally, I thought having a part-time job is a good thing for college students. But the central of a college student is their learning in the college.
