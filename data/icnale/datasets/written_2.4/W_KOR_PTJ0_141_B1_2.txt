I agree. Because of college students are necessary to experience small social. And they have to have a concept about money. When I was young, "Why are they doing? That's just hard and difficult, also no funny. " I thought. But now I'm 21 years old, college student that studying for my great future. I realized that I need some money for buying something like book, note, clothes, shoes, transportation fee etc. and also an experience about social. It's very important to future. If all of college students no experience about part-time job, they will be terrible at their work in the future. The reason is only this: they have no experience! For example, there are two girls: A and B. The A is very smart in their class and all of tests are A+. But she never do part-time job. After she pass the "S" company which is very hard to enter. However, 5 years passed, she stills the end of her group. The others, the B girl become a good business woman. Cruz she has great ability of the transaction of business. [The origin never news discussion] That's difference point; part-time job's importance when there're college students. Today, studying is not all. We've to accumulate various experiences.
