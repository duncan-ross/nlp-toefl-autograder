Nowadays many people smoke in the world. They smoke almost everywhere, such as houses, offices, restaurants and so on. They don't care about other people who don't smoke. I strongly protest that people smoke in the restaurant. Firstly, the restaurant is a public place. And we all know we can't smoke in these place. Why? Because it is a public place, we should keep in our mind that what we are doing should not disturb others. It is not our private space. To tell the truth, I do hate those who smoke in the restaurant. Secondly, a restaurant is a place for people to have their meal, not a place for smoking. We eat food in it. I am not quite sure whether those who smoke like chimneys eat food or cigarettes. The place should be clean and the air should be fresh. Thirdly, we know cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful things. Smoking is bad for our health. It has proved that many serious diseases like lung cancer and heart diseases are linked with smoking. And what is worse is that if a person don't smoke but sit by the smoker, the danger is higher than the smoker themselves. In the end, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And I suggest that smoking also should be banned in every public places.
