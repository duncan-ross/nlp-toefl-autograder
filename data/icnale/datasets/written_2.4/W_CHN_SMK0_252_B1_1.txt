Suppose you are sitting around a beautifully decorated round marble table with your best friends and you are enjoying delicious food. Suddenly, a blast of smoke came into your nostril. What's your feeling then? Here comes the discuss---should smoking in the public be forbidden? As for me, positively, the answer is yes! When you are in the public place, you are not only represent yourself, but also a person related to all. You may think smoking can refresh yourself and make you cool, you may think you only damage your health, you may think others do not care for your behavior. But there is one thing you have to remember---smoking in the public is not good. The smoke from your lung can easily spread to others' lung, although they do not want that happen. The second hand smoke can be more poisonous. Besides, the bad smell of smoke can also influence one's mood thus he or she could not concentrate on the important things. What's worse, smoking in the public can result in the teenagers' smoking, which may cause worse problems in the long term. I appeal all of us to forbid smoking in the public and make our environment better, make our society more harmonious.
