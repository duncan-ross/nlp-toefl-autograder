For me the importance of having a part time job for college students depends on the situation of the family of the student. Because in the Philippines, bades on what I've watched in news and learned in school and etc. Many Filipinos are experiencing poverty which makes many Filipinos not able to study or go in school. Even they want to study they don't have the opportunity or chance to go in school because of having insufficient money. This problem makes those filipino that wants to study buy not capable of paying the tuition and other requirements realized that it is important for them to have a part time job in order for them to attend school. All of us needs education because this is the only thing that others cannot steal from us. Education is important for us because it teaches us responsibility and because they got to learn that his/her parents wont be with them all their lives to support them or to give them what they want. They got to learn how to earn their own money. It is important for us college students to have a part time job for us to be able to lessen the expenses of our parents and in case we need something and our parents cannot provide us money, we can buy it from our own money that came from our work without asking for the help of our parents.
