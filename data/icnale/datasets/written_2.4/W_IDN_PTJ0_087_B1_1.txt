College student should have part time job or better future. The majority of college students think that part time job is needed in order to face the real life. In the future people have to get a job because they will build a family. They get the money from the job and use the money to take care and effort the housing. Then now most of jobs reguire people's experience in the past and when we had part time job such as teacher, computer programmer or even presenter we will easily do the job. Which we have already done in the past. That is the reason why many factories decide to accept people who had a lot of experience rather than people who had good grade in their certificate. Now we are students but in the future we will become a leader at least in our family. When we are students It is proper if we still depend on our parents in financial but when we graduated, our duty is to take care of our own financial by getting a job. Even we have not married yet, we have to collect some property like house, house's properties, the money for our cost when we get married or even luxurious things like car, motorcycle etc by ourself. In the end, having part time job for collage students are very important for their future.
