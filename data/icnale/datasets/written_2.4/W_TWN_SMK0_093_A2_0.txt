I don't like to smell smoke and I hate people smoke around me. When I know the Government to promote smoking are banned where over three people are there, I was very happy. We also know that smoking will break our healthy, liver will become dark, and maybe it became a cancer and take one's life suddenly. So when I see my family smoking, I give advice to them not to smoking. When I go to restaurant, the restaurant should be post the sign "Not smoking. " If they don't, I don't consider entering and eating their meal never. I found that fewer and fewer people smoking today, my family has no one smoking. I have heard that quit smoke is not a piece of cake, it need very self control, so I feel very happy for my family not only for their mind but also their healthy body and life. Now most of the restaurant ask customers not to smoking in the eating area that is said the policy of our government promote is very success. Every time when I sound someone dead for cancer because smoking, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
