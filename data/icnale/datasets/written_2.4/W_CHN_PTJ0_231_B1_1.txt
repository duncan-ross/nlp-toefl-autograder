 I do agree with the first statement that college students need to have a part-time job in their spare time. Firstly, by doing a part-time job, we can broaden our horizons, which, to some degree, can also fulfill our life. For example, we can acknowledge some basic skills we need to lead a good life. Second, some college students have gained a lot of experience through the process and they have also benefited much from it when doing their current work. If we meet a similar problem in our work, we can deal with it smoothly by using the method we have used when we do our part-time job. Third, as college life is filled with a lot of activities, taking part in this one is a good choice, which not only helps us get close to society but also gives us a brief image of different people. To sum up, by taking part in such kind of activity, we can know something about the current society and acknowledge some skills, and at the same time, know how to deal with problems in our daily life. I believe that what our college students need most. As a consequence, we should advocate college students to take part-time jobs.
