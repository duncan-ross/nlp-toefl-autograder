First of all effect of smoking on human being will be explained. as everyone knows that smoking is harmful for any person. It causes various diseases in which lungs cancer and asthma are included. Secondly people who are drug addicted cannot leave it easily. Our society have very strange attitude towards smoking young boys thought that they look charming while smoking although smoking is harmful for them and they knew its well but looking hand some is more important for them then their health. its not due to illiteracy but due to goofiness more over cigar is a status symbol in our society and sign for elite class. There is no a single benefit of smoking anyone who take one step to it will take 2 steps towards it and gradually lead toward faun alcohol act. Smoking is also haram in Islam because many other bad things start from it and it's the rule of Islam that nips the evil in the bud. so Islam do not give permission for it further more the things which cause harm for humans beings Islam do not permit those things and smoking is one of them. a person who is habitude of smoking mostly have very unbearable smell in his mouth while he talks other people feel bad and avoid to take him again. So gradually he lost his good friends and become alone. this thing made him feel up from life and he lost interest in his dressing food and family and sometime comments suicide smoking always harmful for human beings in any foam it dial not give any benefit to anyone except the owner of tobacco companies so the benefit of a nation more important than a single person so the Govt. of employer should completely banned tobacco companies if any Govt. do so then I think it was blessing of Allah on that country.
