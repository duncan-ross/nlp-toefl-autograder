As is well-known and has often been described, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. From my perspective as a college student, I partially agree with the speaker and there are many instances supporting my view. The chief reason for my view is part-time job may increase our life experiences and knowledge. For instance, I usually find a part-time job in my summer vacation or winter vacation. During these days, I could meet many kinds of people who I never seen before and I could learn some things that I never encountered. On the other hand, I think that part-time jobs could influence students' study if these are excessive. Take an example from my country; many students discontinue their schooling because part-time jobs are so busy that they could not go to school. Finally, to understand the truth of part-time jobs is important for college students or not, it is also necessary to see the student's time management. Therefore, I think that the most important thing for students is schoolwork not jobs. To conclude, due to the above-mentioned reasons, it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that I partially agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
