Smoking should be allowed at the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is a personal choice and no one has the right to tell you what you can or cannot do. I have never been to Japan, but I think that the people there probably feel the same way. The best restaurant is the one that best accommodates the wishes of its customers, and restaurants stand to gain the most by attracting as many customers as possible. However, I do not think that this freedom should come at the expense of another's; namely, the nonsmokers. In the same way that people who want to smoke should be able to do so, people who do not want to smoke or be around people who are smoking should not have to do so. Therefore, the best solution is to simply establish both smoking and nonsmoking areas in restaurants. It is also important that these areas be well separated and that a good air circulation system be in place. I have been to a few restaurants where the non-smoking area really didn't seem that much different from the smoking area, and of course this affected my dining experience. In conclusion, smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan as long as people who do not smoke can still enjoy them.
