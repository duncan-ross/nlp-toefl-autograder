As a freshman, I have to admit that taking a part-time job is extremely appealing to us. However, I don't think that it is essential for us to take a part-time job. First of all, taking a part-time job needs too much time and energy. Unlike a hobby, which can make us feel relaxed and happy, a job requires responsibility, attention and takes up a lot of time. It is unwise of a college student to earn some pocket money at the sacrifice of his energy and time, for it may lead to a drop in his or her academic performance. More importantly, we can hardly enhance our abilities through taking a part time job. It cannot be denied that most of the college student's part-time job is being labor, such as washing dishes, severing as a waiter or waitress. What we can get from this kind of work is no more than a tiny bit of money, because this kind of work doesn't involve any thinking or cooperation. Last but not least, it does no help to make you more competent when you apply for a job. Actually, there is no company which regards washing dishes as a kind of working experience. From what has been discussed above, we may easily draw the conclusion that it is not a must for college students to take a part-time job.
