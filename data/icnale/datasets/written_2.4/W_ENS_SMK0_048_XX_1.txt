I was always taught that smoking is very wrong. Your body is your temple, and harming your body is the same as harming god. However, some people think it is okay to continue smoking even though they are hurting themselves. What's even worse is that they are harming other people too. By being a bad role model, they are condemning their progeny to repeat our mistakes. As we continue to live we should move closer to the Lord Jesus Christ, and I think this is also true for Japanese people. In history class, I learned that many Japanese people are now becoming Christians, and this is a good thing. If they have anything to do with being good Christians, they will work hard to ban smoking in the restaurants because they know it is bad. Next, smoking has simply lost some of the cool factor that it had back when I was a kid. The cause of that, there really is no reason to smoke anymore. It is not cool, it is not healthy, and everyone knows that. The fact that anyone continues to smoke bobbles my mind, and the fact that there are governments who are not willing to ban it in restaurants also boggles my mind.
