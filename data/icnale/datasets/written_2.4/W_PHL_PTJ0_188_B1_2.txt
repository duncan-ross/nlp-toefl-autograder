Having a part time job imposes both positive and negative effects on a college student. On a positive perspective, working part time at a young age prepares a student for real life after schooling. He/she is trained to be more responsible as he/she progresses in his/her job. When a college student works part time, he/she also achieves a sense of fulfilment in what he/she does. Once he/she sees a pay check with his/her name on it, the sense of achievement he/she gets is unparalleled. Moreover, a college student who works part time can foresee and ultimately discover what career would fit his/her skills; if ever his/her skills do not fit his/her ambitions, he/she can then focus on developing the skills needed to match that ambition. Money-wise, a college student who has a part time job can easily assist whoever is financing his/her studies. On the other hand, working part time can also make a student less focused on his/her schooling. Although he/she is preparing himself/herself for the real world through work, a degree matched with honors and achievements is what an aspiring employee would need to get into a proper job. In addition, a college student may be discouraged to pursue his/her degree if he/she entertains the thought that the job he/she has can already sustain him/her.
