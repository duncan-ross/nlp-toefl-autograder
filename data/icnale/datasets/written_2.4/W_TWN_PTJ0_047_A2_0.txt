I agree so much. Because college students become grown up, not only children. They should do some part-time work to learn another experience. In work, those experiences can not learn by school. When I was eighteen years old, I hope can do something to earn some money. Because I feel grown up, I will can does something make my family members to happy. Now a lot of college students want buy a lot of things, but they always don not want to find job or part-time. It is so terrible. We can see a lot of major but they just like children? If i were school teacher, I do not like my students to do part-time. Because I do not like students have a lot of time in part-time job. This may let them don't study hard, have too much time in their part-time. When I was child, I hope can do a lot of job to earn my money. It is can make me feel happy and exciting. In the future, if I have children, I will courage they to do some part-time job. So I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job in their college life.
