In my view, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. First, the smell of cigarette smoke often leads to an unpleasant eating environment, particularly for non-smoking patrons or restaurant staff. In my case, if I smell even a whiff of cigarette smoke, my eyes suddenly water and I often begin to sneeze uncontrollably. Others have a similar reaction. Second, cigarettes are a clear fire hazard. Indeed, many buildings have been set completely ablaze simply due to a lone unextinguished cigarette. Moreover, it's the case that many customers consume alcohol. With impaired judgment, inebriated customers cannot be trusted to put out their cigarettes completely. It's also true that restaurants in Japan often occupy only one floor of a larger structure. Should a fire break out in the restaurant, the entire building and its tenants, through no fault of their own, will be put in harm's way. Third, it has widely been proven that secondhand smoke is a major health hazard, particularly for children and newborns, whose lungs have not yet fully developed. The consistent exposure to secondhand smoke may lead to respiratory illness or even lung cancer. Finally, if all restaurants in Japan banned smoking, it would greatly encourage longtime smokers to finally quit. This would promote the health and well-being of millions of people, both smokers and non-smokers alike. For these four reasons, it is clear that smoking ought to be prohibited in all Japanese restaurants.
