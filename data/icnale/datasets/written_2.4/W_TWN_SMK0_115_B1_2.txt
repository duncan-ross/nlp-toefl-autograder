I am highly against smoking, that's why I could declare loudly that I 100 percent support the idea. Smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. Fallowing are the reasons why I think it might be a good idea to do so. First, smoking is not an inevitable part of life, is can be quitted by some trainings or methods. Smokers should not use "addiction" as a reason to smoke wherever they want. Second, smoking is well-known of being bad to health. The risk of getting cancer should only be taken by those who know the danger clearly but still want to smoke, instead of everyone who shares the same space with them. Third, there are some voices calling that banning smoking in public area, like restaurant, is depriving the rights of human beings. However, the right that people have freedom to do whatever they want should have the catch that it won't interfere others' rights. Smoking in the restaurant obviously trespasses the line, due to the fact that many people found smoke annoying. For everyone's advantage, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. If we want the policy to be carried out smoothly, there should be some other choices for smokers. I had read an article about Japan's smoking policy before. In one province of Japan, smoking is completely banned. Those who one wants to smoke in a building should go to the utmost stair, sharing smoke with birds only. Also there are smoking areas which are like a box in the city. People who want to smoke gathering there, and would not disturbed the pedestrians. It might be a good suggestion for the government to consider about, setting things like that near the restaurant, so smoking could be banned inside completely.
