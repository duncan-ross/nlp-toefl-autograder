I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned. There is no good reason for such a ban. Firstly, restaurants have good reasons to allow smokers. Some open-air restaurants have a clientele that consists of a sizeable number of smokers who smoke on its premises. This clientele are no doubt attracted by the fact that the restaurant allows them to smoke freely. On the other hand, other restaurants have a no-smoking policy. These restaurants have determined that they do not want smokers for reasons which could include: being a family-friendly place, that the management is against smoking, that the infrastructure is not catered to disperse the smoke effectively. Secondly, restaurants should have their own right to determine what their stand is on smoking. While smoking is indeed an activity that causes harm to the individual and to others who breathe in second-hand smoke, the negative consequences to others can indeed be controlled by responsible behaviour. Indeed, most restaurants that allow smoking in Singapore often designate certain spots for smokers. These rules are generally respected and followed by smokers who patronize the restaurant. This reflects a certain level of accommodation and compromise by the restaurant management, the non-smoking patrons, and the smokers. Since a stable consensus has been successfully achieved, no further action need be taken by the government.
