According to the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, I do not personally agree with it. As a student, your primary job role is to study hard and get good results, this is what your parents send you to school for. However, if the students tends to get a part-time job, they might be distracted by the short term monetary benefits and therefore neglecting their studies and hence, their results plunged rocket down. Also, many students tends to learn rebellious while being in college and giving them a part time job, letting them think that they are young adults might make things worse as they will have the mindset that they are mature enough to handle what adults can handle and do wrong things they will make them regret for life. Some may also think that they can work the part time job for life and neglecting their studies is no big deal for them since they already have a job and they will not starve. Sadly, little do they know that the wages is barely enough to feed their future family if they tend to get married and have kids of their own.
