I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The advantages of having a part-time job can be divided in two parts. The first part is before the job, and the second part is after the job. In the first part, which means college students try to find a good part-time job. They may read the newspaper or the internet to find what kind of job is good for them. During this process, they have to think carefully which job is better. In addition, they may try to introduce themselves to their boss and experience some interviews. They mush be confident to themselves so that they can make other people believe that they are ready to do jobs. In the second part, they have already worked for a period of time. Doing a part-time job must make them be more responsible to themselves. They also practice their social behavior when they are working. It must be an important experience for them before they are graduate and try to find a normal job in the future. They can higher their emotion quality. They also can use their time much better when they try to balance their life between their studies and jobs. In Sum, having a part-time job is good for college student to practice much more abilities before they graduate. It is a valuable experience.
