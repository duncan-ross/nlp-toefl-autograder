Yes I agree with the above statement. The first and foremost reason is because smoking is totally harmful to one's health and well-being. When someone lights up a cigarette in the restaurant, the smoke that they puff out and either linger in the air or travel around the room is known as second-hand smoking. Second-hand smoking brings even much more disastrous effects and can be detrimental to one's health if they keep breathing the smoke in for a long period of time. Non-smokers who patronized the restaurants just want to have a good time dining and chatting with their companions so they should not have to deal with the smokers who suddenly feel the need to light up. Everyone has been taught to respect one another, the most basic thing when we were younger. So I suggest if the smokers would like to smoke one or two cigarettes, they could respect the other diners and step out of the restaurant for that few minutes and smoke outside or at designated corners of an open-air restaurant if there is one. It would also be a little disgusting if you were to find bits and pieces of cigarette smoke in your soup because a smoker from the table beside yours does not have the basic courtesy to step out for a little while for that puff.
