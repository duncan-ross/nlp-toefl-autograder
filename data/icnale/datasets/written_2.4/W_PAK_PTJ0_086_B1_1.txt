Part time jobs are those which are done with some other job. These are done due to many reasons, 1) For the income 2) For supporting family 3) To carry on their studies and may be done for many other reasons too. But most of students also enjoy and like to do part time jobs. Mainly the job of student is only to study and study. Bur due to some important reasons, like some students do not have money to fulfill his dues. He may do the job to support his family. He may do this for carrying himself and anyone of his family who is suffering from serious disease and they do not have enough money to give fee of doctors. This may result in bad and good aspect but i think so bad results are dominated on the good results. Students who do part time jobs do not get enough time to studying acquire good grades. They are spoiling their time but there must be any strong reason behind why is doing that job. They should avoid jobs if they are doing pas for having from and must study. If they need it and have strong reason to do so then they should do it and must save some time to study. These students are strong and study and they support their family but this may leave bad effect on their study and health. Some of them may become victim inferiority complex. They may spoil their life because working part time job may drag them very from education and such a student may forget the reason and need education in life and society. As a result he would have no future less than doing small jobs and working hard but getting little income, but its bitter reality that Government is not supporting them and students have to face the bitter realities before the time.
