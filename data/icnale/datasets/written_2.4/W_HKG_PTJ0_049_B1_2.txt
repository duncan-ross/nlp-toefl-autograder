Have you heard of the argument for university students taking a part-time job? The answer is definitely yes. Should we support or oppose it? Let us examine the issue. To begin with, let us find out why people are in favour of this argument? It is a simple and irrefutable fact that students can get experience through having a part-time job. Evidently, students can get teaching experience when being a tutor. They can learn how to be a good teacher at early state. Furthermore, students can learn how to deal with customers and communicate with the others when being sales. These are important for employees and employers. Another reason is that students can definitely benefit from the arrangement. According to an official study, there are considerable pros of the arrangement as it helps students develop a sense of responsibility. Students will never be late or absent from university after having a part-time job. Since employers do not allow employees being late or absent. Without doubt, university students taking part-time jobs are controversial subject. Although many people think that the argument is beneficial to university students in Hong Kong, there are some drawbacks. Taking part-time job is very time-consuming. Students will lose their time for study. Therefore, they have bad performance in examination. Personally, I am for the arrangement because its pro outweigh its cons.
