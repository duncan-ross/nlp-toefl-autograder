In many public places, we can often note that some people are smoking while others around them holding their noses. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking in the public restaurants is a bad behavior which put other people's health nowhere. Partly, smoking or not is a private affair, which others are not supposed to interfere in. But when it comes to the public places, smoking influences more than smoker himself but all the people there. In the restaurants, the space is very limited and people hate smoking cannot enjoy their meals when other people smoke around them. Secondly, smoking does harm to the smokers health and may even cause serious disease. We can help the smokers to quit smoking by banning smoking in all the public places. I think that most smokers lack self control. So it is better to have some laws to ban them from smoking in the restaurants. In a word, no smoking restaurants can benefit not only the smokers but also the other people around. So I insist that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, for the public's sake.
