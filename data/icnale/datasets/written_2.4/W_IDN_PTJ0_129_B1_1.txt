Experience is the best teacher. We often find this motto in our daily life. We can get experience not only in the school but also we can get it out of the school. For example we have part job like being a private teacher. It is very useful for the college student who take educational department because they can practice their teaching method directly and it can make their ability in teaching better time by time, year by year. So they can be professional teacher and another advantage of having part job is they will be able to stand alone with out their parents, although they can not separate 100%. At least they can help their parents to fulfill their daily need by their selves, and they can feel how difficult to look for money. So that, they can appreciate the money and their parents effort to fulfill their needs. The important one for the college student who has part job is they do not have to forget their main purpose. That is study and reach their ambition in order it can make their parents proud of them. The things that can make parents happy and proud is we can be a success person in the future. So that to reach that we should have not only education but also the thing which can support it. That is experience, because it can help us to be a success person.
