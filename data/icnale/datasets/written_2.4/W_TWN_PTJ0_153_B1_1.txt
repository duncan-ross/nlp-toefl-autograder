Nobody would think that money is not important. Especially for students, how sweet the first time making money by himself or herself. Some students have to making money to afford everything he or she needed. This kind of students has no choice, their parents asked they to make their own money that they must find a part-time job. Except these students, most of students make money for themselves. I think that finding a part-time job to students is good experience to help them learning more skill or knowledge what they couldn't get from university or college. But I think not every kind of job is suitable to students. Some sort of job would not be a helpful working experience. So if students do not have to worry about money, I think find a job that related with major would be a more useful experience. Even thought I support the viewpoint that student could find a part-time job, studying still would be students' main job. However, studying is the real job for students. Not only learning more skill or knowledge is the reason I support, but learning how to handle students' own money is important too. To know how to make money be more useful could let people be rich. Therefore, I think that it's important for students to get a part-time job.
