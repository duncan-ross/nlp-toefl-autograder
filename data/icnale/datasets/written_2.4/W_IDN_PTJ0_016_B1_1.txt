It is important to college student to have a part time job, especially for those who already at sixth or seventh grade. We cannot earn a lot of money from doing a part time job but it can give us an experience, so when we finally graduate from college, we are totally ready for the work world. Because in my opinion, when we are at the work world, high grade at college or good marks do not important anymore. The company searching to people who ready and has an experience at their major. Part time job can give us a lesson, for example, at part time job, student can learn that the team work is the most important to have. Usually at school or at college, student very selfish about marks. They want to have a highest grade at class, or something else. But when we are at work world, we are not allowed to work by ourselves for all the task to do. We usually has a team that we need to discuss to, and we need to do a work team, and anything else. So in my opinion, it is very important to college student to have a part time job although they are not graduated yet.
