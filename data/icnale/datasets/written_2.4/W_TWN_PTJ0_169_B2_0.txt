I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. For being pre-adults before entering the career society, it is essential for college students to face the music to see how weak their minds and their abilities are. Life at school is far different from that at work. Meanwhile, working part time can make students learn how to manage their time among studies, jobs, entertainments, and other personal stuffs. Also, there will be some income for students who have part-time jobs that can release their parents' economic stress. Students will be able to learn how to manage their money as well, and become independent from their parents' supports gradually. When I was a freshman last year, I worked two part-time jobs. Even though both of them are inside school and were not quite ough, those jobs made me braver and easier to interact with others, and also acknowledge more professors. "Smile" and "patience" are the most important experience that I learned from my work. I used to expressing my temper out directly, but I changed a lot after I worked for and with so many people. Moreover, as what I mentioned above, my time-management was getting better and efficient. I would finish all my stuff before I went to work so that I would not be too tired to do them when I got back from work. Last but not least, I became not so embarrassed when I asked money from my parents since I paid from my income most of the time, the money required from my parents become fewer, which gave me the best sense of achievement during the working experience. In brief, I agree and recommend that it is important for college students to have a part-time job
