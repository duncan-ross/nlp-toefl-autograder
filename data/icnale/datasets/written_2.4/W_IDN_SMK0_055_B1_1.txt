A restaurant is a place for everyone to eat and drink and the restaurant should forbid people to smoke there because it can interfere with nonsmokers who were eating there, you should also self-conscious smokers not to smoke in there I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants, it's true that non smokers can avoid smoke, but that's only if they avoid smokers too. There was a Law in my country when all restaurants were divided in smoking and non smoking section. What happened? All non smokers with friends who smoked had to go to the smoking section because they didn't want their friends to get a ticket for smoking in a non smoking section. Smoking is a bad habit, I don't have to say this cuz all smokers and non smokers know this. My friends smoke less (which is great) when they are at the coffee shop or at the disco because they have to go outside, what they do home is their business but honestly if they smoke inside i don't go to their place, that's my right, and they can't smoke at my place, so if they don't want to come over, it's their right. While the government should banned cigarette ads that aired on television and reduce the circulation of cigarettes in the community for public health and the state guaranteed to be healthy and developed countries.
