First of all, let's check out why students do part time jobs. There are three main reasons that could firmly account for this phenomena. First, more and more students want to be economically independent and PTJ is a perfect way. Second, students can learn a lot which they shall never learn in class from PTJ. Third, the whole society is gradually admitting college students as its capable modernist, which provides more opportunities to college students. Of course, each coin has two sides. Some people argue that PTJ may cost a student a lot. A lot of students can't fully concentrate on their studies since they take PTJ and then their grades fall sharply---which is not good in the long term. In my opinion, there is a balance between study and work. Students in college may get a lot of free time and PTJ is ok for a college student as long as he or she gets a good hang of using free time. Everyone shall get their own job, why not get used to it when you are young?
