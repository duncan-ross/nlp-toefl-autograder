Working students, college students in particular, are not uncommon sights. In the Philippines, maybe not so much, but in some other countries, yes, or at least this is what is being portrayed by the media. Whether or not having part-time jobs is good and beneficial for the students is subjective, dependent on the needs a student has to meet. But regardless of it being beneficial to some, it is not a must – not an extremely important aspect – for students. The main reason for this is that it might, and most probably will, result in the lack of focus on studies. If students involved and busied themselves with part-time jobs, more time will be taken up, there is demand from work separate from that of school, and this builds up to added stress on the part of the students. There is also the possibility of having them prioritize these jobs instead of education. This, of course, is not saying that it is entirely bad. One good thing students can pick up from part-time jobs is learning to balance work and studies, thus becoming more time-efficient. It prepares them for life after schooling. However, as stated earlier, it is not something important or imperative for students to take, especially if it threatens to hamper studies, and also if is not really needed.
