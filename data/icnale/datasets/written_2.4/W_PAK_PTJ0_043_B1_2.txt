Part time job for college student is not essential. But in some respect it may be essential. Some student whose parent is not able to educate them because they are poor. Some student parent had died. So they do job after college time. It is bad because in this way they do not give time to their study. Which cause failed in collage? College should have opportunity to give them money and to teach them free on the basis of their previous result and also give money to fulfil their needs for books and their person needs. For this purpose government should take step. They should make college in which student which are poor can study and also give them daily work. Or in the other hand after school time in the school or college they do some and Government give them rupees to fulfil their needs. Some student do part time fob to busy them salve they should not do so because it destroy their future. They should give attention to their study and get success. Some student do this to fulfil their outstanding desire which they do not fulfil with their pocket money it only waste their time if they do so the do not give attention to study and if they also give attention to study they weak physically. And disturb their health. For poor student Government take step and for other student they do not so do.
