Nowadays, our society is full of many college students, however, most of them do not understand the works which they really want or they are really suitable. So I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Partly because by taking a part-time job can make college students know more about the related works, and partly because they can learn more knowledge in different areas, and partly because they can experience many different lives. Maybe college students will meet some difficult or some trap, but these things can be something help you in the future. But we also should notice some things, for example, we should be careful when taking a part-time job, we have to take care of ourselves, and most important is that we must not give up our majority. We have to put our schoolwork on the top one, that is, we should pass all of the subjects safely at least, but not failed. After all, being a college student is what you need to do now, so I think that if college students want to take a part-time job, they should also take much time to do their schoolwork.
