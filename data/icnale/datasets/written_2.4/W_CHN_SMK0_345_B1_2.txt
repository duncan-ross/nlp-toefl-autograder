Although how to ban smoking is a hard social problem, we must try our best to find the way, since the harmful effect added on people, not only the man he himself smokes but also every person around him, is known to all and can't be neglected. A man who is addicted to smoking tends to smoke every time and everywhere, even out of control. If you set a sign reading no smoking, he will just say in mind :okay, I should pretend not to see it, not to mention that he will keep the ban in mind. In fact, the effect of the ban hasn't appeared genarally so far, neither in restaurants nor even in school. But how can we do? First of all, we should strengthen the law constraint against smoking in public, i. e. increase penalty of the person who violates the ban. Secondly we should try to build our good atmosphere in society. It's ideal to educate people the harm that smoking can do on us, including those who are smoked by others. Besides, whether a person has a discipline of smoking in pubilic is a matter about social morality and basic qaulity that a man should possess. In that way, increasing public qaulity is the central mission since it's the essential and radical factor of how willing the man is to avoid smoking in public. There lies the way, maybe long and narrow, of the effective ban on smoking in public, for our faith in the final existence of no-smoking public places.
