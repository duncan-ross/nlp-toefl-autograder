I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because do part-time job can make college students get more knowledge of the live. If students have no job experience they must meet something risks. For example: In society they cannot have enough experience to find normal job. This is why parents ask their son to find part job to get some job experience Second when we get some part-job, we can meet different someone else. I think if we meet more people that we can learn more things. This thing maybe bad news but can let us learn experience to avoid that. Like my experience. I worked in the elementary school. I must take care of students in their class. In the fact this work is so hard because this students too difficult to control They make me so tired, but I think the experience can make me faced difficult things can get enough braves. The experience is very important than any else. Although part-time job maybe difficult for students but if we can make money by this part-time job and use this part-time to learn more knowledge and more friends we can feel happy. Part time job is Very important for me
