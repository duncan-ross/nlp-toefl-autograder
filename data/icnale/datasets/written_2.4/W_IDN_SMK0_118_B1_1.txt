According to me, there are two opinion about this. Some people say yes, but others say no. For smokers, cigarette has some advantages. It can reduce their stress and make them calm down. Besides that, it can be a heater when they feel cold. Smoking is our rights and one of the big entry for our country. So maybe it is not fair if smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. And sometimes, in the several restaurant there is a special place for smoker. So we, as a customer who want to eat at that restaurant feel comfort without any complaining about smoking. That's why some people say no if smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. On the other hand, some people agree if smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Imagine when you eat a plate of delicious food and then, there is someone smoke next to you. Of course, you feel not comfortable to eat. If you want to say it to that man, I think you need a bravery to do that. Absolutely, the customer of the restaurant is not only the adult but also many childrens on there. So if you want to eat in the restaurant while you smoke, you better to go to the restaurant which has a special place to smoke.
