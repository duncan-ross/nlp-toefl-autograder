I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in my country. In public places, there is no objection to prohibit smoking inside. However, restaurants are owned by privates, and the owners have the right to choose. Some people insist that banning the restaurant smoking is related to health problems for servers who work at. For them, too, it is their choice to work at the smoking permitted places. These days, instead of making whole café non-smoking area, there are partitions for smokers and nonsmokers there. It is more reasonable method to welcome both the smokers and non-smokers. Those who want to ban the smoking at all restaurants may believe that doing so help whole people quit smoking in the shared areas. It makes sense, however, smokers are now under great pressure to stop smoking. They are the one who choose to smoke by themselves, who are adults. As non-smokers' right of not breathing cigarette toxics is important to non-smokers, it is also important to guarantee the smokers' right of smoking in'certain places', besides cold outside especially in winter time. Because both rights are important, we need a mutual negotiation. I think banning smoking at all restaurants is too extreme decision. Even though smoking is not an advisable thing, it is violating the right of smokers.
