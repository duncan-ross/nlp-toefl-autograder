Smoking must be banned in all restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I must agree with this. First, second hand smoking is worse than smoking the cigarette itself. It has its ill effects. People must be considerate to other people. The ingredients in cigarettes affect everything from the internal functioning of organs to the efficiency of the body's immune system. The effects of cigarette smoking are destructive and widespread. Second, it has an ingredient called nicotine, which reaches the brain within 10 seconds after smoke is inhaled. Third, it contains carbon monoxide which binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, preventing affected cells from carrying a full load of oxygen. Fourth, it contains carcinogens, which damage important genes that control the growth of cells, causing them to grow abnormally or to reproduce too rapidly. Fifth, it would greatly affect the customers in the restaurant. Think about it, some people get pissed when the tables next to them are smoking. What if the family has a child with them, it would affect the children's internal functioning and its immune system as stated previously. Researchers state that in every eight seconds, a human life is lost to tobacco use somewhere in the world. That translates to approximately 5 million deaths annually. Tobacco offers us a life of slavery, a host of chronic, debilitating illnesses and ultimately death. And think about it: We pay big bucks for those "benefits. "
