I strongly disagree with smoking in public places. There are billions of people addicted to the cigarette in our country and we could find people smoking everywhere, for instance, in restaurants, train station and even in schools where there are children, the future of our nation, just like smoking has already been a custom of us. As is known to us all, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and all the people staying around, and the second-hand smoking will have more terrible influences. At the same time tobacco cost a lot of our money day after day. Growing could also waste more resource which could be used for grain instead. So for the sake of ourselves, we are supposed to try our best to make more people give up smoking, which will also let us get more advantages. Firstly, the health of us and our family is very important. Secondly we could protect the nature by pouring less harmful gas. Also it's a good manner to refuse smoking and set a good example to the children. Although we has to acknowledge that it is difficult to give up smoking, not smoking in the public places especially where children stay is the bottom.
