It is a peaceful afternoon. The place is packed with people but no one is making that big of a fuss. Menus, ceramics and cutlery patiently wait on each table top. Women in uniform lead families, friends or other kinds of groups of people to empty tables. Waiters glide from table to table some with pens and little rectangle pieces of paper clipped neatly together to take orders with while others with large round trays filled all kinds of mouth-watering dishes to be delivered to their hungry customers. The delectable scent of food wafts through the air. Unfortunately it is not alone. Smoking has become a great problem in the Philippines. Hundreds of people die every day from smoking. Most of these victims are not even smokers. Those who smoke not only endanger their own lives but also the lives of everyone within proximity of the smoke. Poison and other nasty particulates enter the lungs and do all kinds of horrible messes. It is a nuisance to everyone. A restaurant is a place that offers food and food related products. It a place where families and friends can gather together to enjoy a hearty meal and each other's company. It is also where vices, such as smoking, can come together to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims. It is inevitable that people may be exposed to these. Worst of all, some of these people are small children. Smoking should be banned in not only public but also in private places, most especially in restaurants. This will benefit not only the smokers but also other customers. A restaurant is a place of food and entertainment. It should never include smoking. If smoking is banned in all restaurants in the Philippines, the threat of death wafting in the air will eradicated.
