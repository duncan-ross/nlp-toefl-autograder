I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason for this is that the restaurant is a place where everybody eats food for health. In the restaurant, we get some nutrition needed and even we can have mental satisfaction by eating or drinking something. However, if there are some people who are smoking, they are disturbing other people who want to enjoy their meal and take nutritious things. Toxic stuff of the cigarette offends people's right for health who do not smoke at all. This seems impolite and even violent. So, smoking in the restaurant should be regulated. Moreover, it is not good for our children to see smoking in the restaurant. In general, the restaurant is a casual place where children and teenagers can go to eat easily. If they see some adults smoking in this place, they may learn that smoking is not that serious and people can smoke anywhere without regulation or difficulty. Also, children have a strong desire to mimic adults, so they can easily have a chance to smoke by seeing the smoking adults in the restaurant. Therefore, by banning smoking at all the restaurants we can avoid these problems.
