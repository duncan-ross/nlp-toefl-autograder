I think that part-time job is very important for college students. I have three reasons for that. The following passage is the reasons why I think that. First, it is because students are very poor. We have to spend a lot of money in various situations. For example, we have to buy textbooks, have lunch, and have dinner with my friends. If I live alone because my parent's home is very far from my college, the money I have to pay by myself will be very high. Second, we have to reduce my parent's expenses. The total of our expenses for my going to college are over two million yen. Our parents pay them. So we have to earn money to help them, even if they are little money. Third, I think that it is very important to know difficulties with working while we are students. We have to graduate from college for four years and work in society for about forty years. If we have never had a work-time job while we are college students, we won't be able to keep up with the difficulties with working. For these reasons, I think it is very important for college students to work part-time.
