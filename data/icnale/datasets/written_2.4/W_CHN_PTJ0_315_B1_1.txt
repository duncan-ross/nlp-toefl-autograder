I hold the view that part-time job is not necessary for college students. Above all, taking a part-time job will undoubtedly occupy a lot of time which should be spent on study, leading to a negative effect on our major mission, study. Take my classmate ****** for example. He take a part-time job as a guard out of curiousity. At first, he was fond of it. However, with the increase of classes, he discovered that he had to set aside too much time for the part-time job decreasing his study quality. Now, he wanted to get rid of it. So it is concluded that taking a part time job is bad to our study. However, some of my friends hold the view that it is necessary for college students take part-time job for the reason that it is not only a good way of increasing our income but also good experience. Nevertheless, I disagree with it. First, a college student has to spend 500 RMB per month. Taking a part-time job can only bring 50 RMB per month. It is not worth of spending so much time. Secondly, we should acquire in college is kowledge not work experience. After graduate, we have a lot of time to get work experience and little time to study. It is obvious that it is better to study now and take a job in the future. So, the opinion that part-time job is necessary for college students is wrong. In short, I believe that part-time job is not necessary for college students.
