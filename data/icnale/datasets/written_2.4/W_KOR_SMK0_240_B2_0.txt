Smoking has been known to be very harmful to respiratory organs, and it is pointed as the main cause of cancer. However, tens of thousands of people are smoking still, because they have been addicted already. Thus, it is important to provide a strong opportunity to quit the smoking. People are smoking to relieve their stress, but it's not the good solution because it can bring the bigger problem like lung cancer. Further, it can harm to other people who don't smoke, because when smoking people breathing out, the ingredients contained in the smoke can affect the other people. In other word, people can die for smoking. However, the problem is that it is not easy to quit the cigarette. How can we pull them up from smoking? How can we save them from smoking? We can use the strategy of punish, and one of punish can be banning smoke at all the restaurants in the country. It can decrease the chances of smoke happening, because they will pay a pretty penny when they don't follow the regulation. Helping them by banning the smoke seems too progressive, but it could be an appropriate solution to help them move out from the addiction. Moreover, we can use the fine collected from the smokers to help other poor people. In sum, I agree to make a restrict zone in our life zone.
