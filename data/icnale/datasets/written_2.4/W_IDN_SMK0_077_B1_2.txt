Yes, I think the government should ban smoking at all restaurants in the country. Because, smoking is not good for customers, and that is not good for employees as well. Cigarette smoke may interfere with the convenience of those who do not smoke. It is also very repulsive to other people who are closed by the smoker. Cigarette smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanade, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart desease, and respiratory problems. The greatest risk in passive smokers, because they are most widely smoke inhalation rather than the smoker. Non smokers should not be subject to such a disgusting habit, because this is very dangerous as like explained above. Want to ban smooking in public places especially in the restaurant is not about depriving the rights of the smoker. Smoker will still have the right to smoke in their own space. The right to harm another person slowly and delibrately never be perceived of us. The smoker should have more respect for people who do not smoke, I guess. So, smoke from cigarettes smoked by the smokers is not inhaled by non smokers. We have to keep healthy each other, I guess.
