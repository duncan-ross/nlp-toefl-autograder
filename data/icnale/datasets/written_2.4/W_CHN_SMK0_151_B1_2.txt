In our modern society, all too often we observe that a large number of people get into the habit of smoking at the restaurant; some of them are even students. And whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer varies greatly. Some people suppose, in some cases, it's very necessary and unavoidable to smoke at a restaurant, especially among business men when they do business. And many people think that smoking can also make people feel refreshed and relaxed after a long day at work. So they want to smoke when they are eating their meals in the restaurants. However, most people believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. One of the most common reasons is that smoking does harm to the health of both the smokers and nonsmokers, worst of all, it may cause the cancer and heart disease. And an individual who smokes a lot may not be popular among people around him just because of the unpleasant smell from his body. I am personally in favor of the ban of the smoking. Because it not only benefit our physical capacity but also save us a large amount of money.
