Some students want to get a part-time job to have more money to spend, while some parents do not let their children to have a part-time job. I think it's important for students to have a part-time job during their college time. First, after graduation in college, we students will not be students anymore. We are the adult, and should have the responsibility for us. We have to earn money by ourselves. So we must have some experiences before enter a company. That will help us do better in our job and also can adjust in it as soon as possible. Second, as in foreigner country, after senior high school, children have to earn their own money. To pay the college tuition, house rent, eat and drink shirts and pants, entertainments... etc. So, we follow the steps of them. To have a part-time job, earn a little money. Last but not least, even have a part-time job is important for college students. Also we have to study hard in the class. Because the most important thing for college student is to do their best in their learning. So, finding a job is good, but don't let it have some bad effect on your learning. Or it will be more a loss than gain.
