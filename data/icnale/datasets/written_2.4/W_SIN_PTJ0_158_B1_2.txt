 Recently, we see many college students taking up part time jobs after school or during holidays. They work at common places like fast food restaurants or help out at shops to promote items. Is it necessary for these students to have a part time job while they are still in school? In my point of view, I agree that it is important for college students to take up such roles. It enables them to understand and experience how work life is like. When we apply for jobs in the future, it may contribute to our resumes because we will need to indicate our work experiences prior to applying for the current job. Moreover, the government has been strongly promoting the middle aged people to undergo training to upgrade them. Hence, college students can take this opportunity to learn and gain experiences before they step into the working society. Hopefully, by acquiring these skills, it will be an advantage to them. Furthermore, some college students shy away from others in school. They do not dare to speak up and remain quiet. By taking up a part time job and through interactions with people, it builds their relations with others and boosts their self confidence.
