Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants although it arouses a huge controversy. Second-hand smoke affects health is common knowledge. It is unfair to non-smoker if smoking is not banned in a closed area. Furthermore, Restaurant is a place that children and elderly are able to get in. It causes a more severe impact on their health especially as they are vulnerable. On the other hand, smokers can go to public areas to smoke, but not at the restaurants. Some smokers claim that the implementation of smoking ban deprives of their freedom. In fact, it is not true. Stopping from smoking do not affect smokers' health, however, passive smoking affects the health of non-smokers. Non-smokers do not have choice. They suffer more than smokers if smoking ban is not implemented. There is a suggestion that setting up of smoking area from non-smoking area is a win-win situation. As we cannot avoid smoke from passing to non-smoking area, it is not a solution to passive smoking. In addition, the size of restaurants in Hong Kong is very small. It is impossible to keep a distance from smoking area to non-smoking area. Therefore, complete smoking ban at all restaurants is necessary. As we gain nothing from smoking by any means, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
