Nowadays, education is accepted wildly since sciences, technologies and communications are developing. It is necessary to have knowledge for avoid educators 'cheating. Studying in college can increase both knowledge and abilities in develop your country for high quality and modern because of the breaking through world steady. Employers, moreover, want someone who has knowledge and enough qualification to work with them. Although you have both knowledge and qualification that they need, you do not have any experience it is an disadvantage. So I agree with the topic that we should do a part-time job during studying in college because a part-time job gives both an experience and money. Beside the two things is mentioned, responsibility is the most important thing that you receive. In most applications need applicants who have some experience about job that you applied because working will face problems that you must solve it in appropriated ways and in time. If you have it, you will solve it easily in order to you have ever faced it. I what is more repeat that having a part-time job get some money, new experiences and responsibilities, you can decreasing parents' duties which studying in college must spend a lot of money. If you could get money by yourself, you will be proud.
