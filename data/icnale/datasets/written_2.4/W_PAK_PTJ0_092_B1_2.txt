Part time job is the way of earning money for every kind of people specially those who want to improve their lifestyle and to fulfil their needs of life. It indicates that these jobs are done by those people who belong to a middle class family. Because they need money. There the discussion is about the part time jobs for college students for me, this idea is totally wrong that the college students should do the part time jobs because when they started to earn the money, no matter from where they get it, they divert from their studies, their minks changed. The season behind my opinion, is that I am also a college student not a professional. So I have no experience or a little about the circumstances of different people. But if the condition is so miserable that a student has to do the job. Then he should be because there is no way for him to carry on his studies. So this problem has some good aspects as mill as bad. But they really should do if they need. But if they don't they should not do and give full concentration on studies. So the part time job is not good for students.
