In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, there is no need to argue that smoking is extremely bad for health, which is the main cause for lung cancer and other diseases. The passive smoking is even more harmful and if someone smoke in the restaurant, all the customers will suffer from it. Moreover, if smoking is banned, the restaurant will be under lower risk of fire, especially in the private chartered dining rooms. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurant is a policy which will help in the restaurant management. Without smoke and snipes, the hygiene standard of the restaurant will be improved. Also there will be no more complains about passive smoking from the customers. Lastly, according to research result, smoking while having meals will affect your appetite. In order to enjoy the delicious food in the restaurant, it is better to completely ban smoking. Many smokers feel unfair that the police is not people oriented for them. They argue that they will feel extremely uncomfortable if they cannot find places to smoke sometimes, which I think is quite reasonable. Maybe other than banning smoking completely, common smoking rooms should be set in the restaurants to solve this problem.
