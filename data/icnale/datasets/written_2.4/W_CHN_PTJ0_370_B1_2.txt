 Judging from the current education in China, I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of my perspective, I think the most important thing for a student, even a college student, is studying. Every other matter can't be the excuse for it. From the examples of those well-known people, we can notice that those great people's success had nothing with whether they had done the part-time job. I don't deny that doing a part-time job can give us hands not only on making money but also on accumulating working experience, however, it also has a negative impact. Having a part-time job can weaken our study. All of us students go to the college for gaining better education, not money or something else. So a part-time job is not necessary, of course except the guys who are really in bad conditions. For most students, a part-time job can cost them a lot of time and sometimes maybe they should skip classes to meet the need of the director of the part-time job, And absolutely the study will be influenced. The more time you spend on the job, the worse marks you will get. In general situations, this is true, So don't try it facilely. Furthermore, doing a part-time job in the college might expose us to the society fulled with money and deal too early. In the brains of everybody, at a certain time, there should be something particular. And when we are college students, we should own dreams, ambitions in our brains which can be easily ruined by the ugly things we see during the part-time job. In short, studying, at least now, is our most important case. We shouldn't abandon what we are supposed to do just for a part-time job. Don't emphasize it too much. Do all that you should do firstly.
