I think that smoking should be completely banned not only in the restaurants, but across all eating places in the country. I am not a smoker, so I do not see why I should be penalising myself by breathing in second-hand smoke from others when I am eating. We pay the same premium for having a meal outside, and thus, smokers and non-smokers should be entitled to the same, non-smoking scene too. Lighted cigarettes are not only smelly, they are potentially cancer-causing to innocent others who just happen to be in the same place at the correct time. While I have friends who are smokers, they are considerate enough to not smoke in front of their non-smoker friends. However, the situation is chaotic when the smokers congregate together to smoke. They not only smoke, they chain smoke, and this goes on for a long period of time. Considering that a restaurant is a place for people to gather together for food, smoking and chain smoking will affect the non-smokers from the time they step in to the restaurant till the time they finish eating. This is especially detrimental to the poor lungs of the young children and the asthmatic. Moreover, assuming that the restaurant is one whereby there is a centralised air-conditioning system, they whole place will be filled with smoke!
