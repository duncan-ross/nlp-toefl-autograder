When I go to the restaurant, I often see some people who smoke during the meal. Although the restaurant is designated as non -smoking area, Some impolite people smoke and damage to other people. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country. Restaurant is a public place. We should be good mannered in public area. It is impolite to smoke in the public area. We go to the restaurant not to breathe the smell of cigarette but to have delicious meal. when I smell cigarette during meals, I feel very bad because I could not taste the food. The smell of smoke have a bad effect on the taste of the food. Moreover, we experiece indirect smoke in the restaurant. Indirect smoke can be as harmful as smoke. Recently, some restaurants are divided into smoking and non-smoking area and others are not allowed to smoke. But some people smoke in the non- smoking area or we often smell the ciagarette from the smoking area. segregation of smoking and non-smoking area is not effective. In this reason, we need intensive control. So I think that smoking in the restaurant should be completely banned for the healthy meals. .
