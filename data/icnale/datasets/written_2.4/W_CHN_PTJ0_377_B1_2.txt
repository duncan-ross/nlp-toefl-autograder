 I agree that college students should do a part-time job. However, most students ignore the importance of a part-job due to serious reasons. In my point of view, there are several reasons why we think it important to do a part- job. One fairly reason is that doing a part-time job can help us gain more experience and give us a chance to make our knowledge into practice. In our part-time job, we can have access to society out of university rather than be buried in books. In addition, many college students can't live without their parents' support. Most of them even waste money forgetting their parents' difficulties of making money. So if we make money by ourselves, we will feel the happiness and hardness of working and appreciate our parents. Meanwhile, some students think a part-time job will take up most of their spare time so that they have no time for study and their favorite activities. To some degree, I think if we arrange our time accurately and make full use of our time, there still can be enough time for us to do other things. On the contrary, we will spend less time for computer games or something boring and then spend more time doing a significant job. Doing a part-time job can make our college life more colorful and unforgettable. In a word, we should have a try.
