I agree with the statement. I think having a part-time job broadens college students' life perceptions, and from experience which they get from part-time jobs they can learn many things about their society and lives. The things they can learn from the experience aren't the things they can learn at college. For example, they learn how money moves in their society, how many kinds of people live in their world, and so on. However, if students spend their time only on doing part-time jobs, they should stop doing them. This is because the main thing for college students is studying. People go to college to study more about what they want to study, so they should study a lot. Nowadays some students at college don't study a lot. They studied hard to go to good university when they were high school students, and they didn't have special reasons to go to college. This kind of students spends their time a lot on doing part-time jobs. In this case, the experience from jobs can't give them good effects. They lose the true reason to study at college. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job only if they go to college and study hard. Having a part-time job will help them in the future.
