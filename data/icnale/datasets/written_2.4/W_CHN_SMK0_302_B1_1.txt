As we all know, smoking does great harm to not only smokers but also other people around and the environment. So some people advised that we should ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country, with which I don't agree. Below are the reasons: First, the amount of smoker in our country is an extremely large number. Obviously, it's impracticable to let everyone of them give up smoking. When these people go to restaurants, they will feel so bad if there is no room for them to smoke, which is a little unkindness. Secondly, a restaurant is a place where people eat food as well as relax. To some people, it is smoking that let them calm down and relax. And the number of these people may be very large. If they can't do what they think is relaxing, they may choose not to go there, and thus the restaurants' business can be badly influenced. At last, we can set up some special smoking room for smokers in restaurants so they don't disturb other people. This solution can solve many problems that smoking may bring. We can find that it can keep balance between smokers and others, so banning smoking is not a must. Banning smoking is a meaningful but hard work. We should take account for many practical factors in the process. So, smoking shouldn't be completely banned now. I believe we can find a good way to solve these smoking problems and reduce the amount of smokers.
