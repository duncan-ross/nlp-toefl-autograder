I think it's a bad way. There are two reasons why I disagree with this opinion. First, smoking is a right culture. There are many many people who love smoking and cannot do without smoking. A famous philosopher is said that he must have not been able to make his great theory without smoking. Like this, smoking is a part of their life. I haven't ever taken smoke, but I wonder the feeling of a heavy smoker having meal without smoking is as sad as the feeling of us eating Soba without chopsticks. Like the people who can't enjoy eating with smoke, there are the people who can't enjoy eating without smoke. This is a just difference of cultures. So we can't judge which one is right. And restaurants are not places only to have meal but also to have fun. So this opinion is completely ignore smokers, a large part of citizens. Second, we can choose which restaurant to go. If you hate smoke, you should go to it that doesn't arrow to smoke. We can avoid them easily unlike walking smokers. And if we think of smoker's and the people's around smokers health, we should take other ways for example increasing the tax of tobaccos or encouraging the restaurants which have only no smoking seats. To enjoy with all of us, we must give smokers the room to eat with smoking.
