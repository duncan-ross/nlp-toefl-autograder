Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm strongly agreeing with this topic because smoking is bad for our life and another life too. If we are smoking it, others people will receive our smoke and when them are breathing in, they will have the poison in their body even though they are not smoking person. Smoking is making us dead as fast as possible especially the person who smokes it very much per day. Cigarettes are very easy to buy. We will see it in the shopping center or mini mart, so once of the reason that the most teenagers are smoking it because it is selling in everywhere, easy to find, and easy to buy too. In the restaurant, they must banned the smoking person and forbidden about smoking since the smoke will bother another people. I think smoke have a bad smell and it is bad with my body, therefore I never touch it and never try it. I always tell my friends too. I think the government must have the rule and should strict with that rule too. More over forbidden smoking in the restaurants is not enough for i think in the school and in the university should have this rule too for making the clean and fresh air space.
