I agree with this statement. Especially for those students who do not have to pay for their education or day to day living expenses. In my experience, I find that these students in particular, have the lowest rate of successfully gaining employment within the first three months of entering the job market. I believe that this has a lot to do with the attitude that they project during initial job interviews. The feedback that I have received, suggests that it appears that they have put little effort into their resumes, presentation skills and tend to come across with a persona akin to "Give me the job. I deserve it because I am here. " I am certainly not suggesting that this applies to all students that fall into this category. However, my limited research has shown that students who have held part-time positions while studying, seem to work harder and are more proactive in their job seeking efforts. The fact that they appear to be more successful in finding work sooner, does suggest that further research is needed to pinpoint the differences between both categories of students. For my part, I will continue to recommend to all my students to seek part-time employment because I believe that they gain additional skills and also seem to have more of a sense of pride in what they do.
