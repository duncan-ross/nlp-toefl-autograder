Many people in the past died from disease they had no effective modern medicines to cure them. But in developed world people do not die from disease but they die from drugs. The most famous drug which kills our life is cigarette. Most of men and women die because of smoking cigarette. Bad people always love to smoke in public places so good people who do not smoke are killed by them. It is very bad if restaurants in country allow them to smoke. It will make the bad air for other customers in the restaurant. So manager of restaurant should ban smoker who is smoking in restaurant. Managers can set the rule for control this problem; you might allow the smokers to come in next time if they smoke in your restaurant. Smoker will be fined by manager if they have done it. Every restaurant should publish their rule by announcement or draw a picture "No smoking here" Government should declare to teenager or someone who is under 18 years old can not buy cigarette. Please fine the cigarette buyer if they sell cigarette to teenager. Because normally teenager buy cigarette and take it to smoke in public like restaurant, university and but stop. It is very important problem that government should solve and improve right now.
