In my opinion, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. Some people hold the opinion that college students will not have so much time to study if they take a part time job. I doubt as I am inclined to believe that can students can really absorb something precious that can hardly been gained from the textbooks by taking a part time, such as social expericence, the ability to corpoerate well with other and so on. Students may probably get exhausted from studying mentally. So why not go outside and do a part-time job? This will not only enable you to forget about all the painful things in the university and also provide you with a great chance to meet more people in different careers and a new, special horizon to think about the world. It seems appealing to me. Some people may think part-time work to be tiring. However, I have a complete different idea towards this idea. We can just take the part-time job for a chance to exercise, just like sports activities. And I think a student has the desire to improve himself by doing a part-time job, he will never feel tired and on the contrary he will try his hard to do it. What's more, we can get money from taking a part-time job and this is the first step that we learn to rely on our own and it's really meaningful for our future.
