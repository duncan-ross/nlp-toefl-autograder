In the big cities often found many college student have a part - time job. They are working usually used to add their pocket money to fulfill all their necessary in the boarding house and also lecture. Mostly they can share their time to lecture and work to fulfill and then spare time in their activities but don't disturb their lecture. They can work as salesmen in the mall, in the shop, restaurant, café etc. I agree with a part – time job done by college student because it is positive activities can help and reduce their parents give in economic problems. Besides in working could found many experiences, get new friends so can learn cooperative, socialization, responsible and friendly with other. The other reason they can also learn how to communicate with the other in the working place well. They could understand how really hard to earn money, they also can appreciate how important money is for life and for everything around then starting to live economically by only buy the important thing. Usually also get satisfied and happiness because get salary from working their self to add their pocket money. And then also can to learn in the new work places the next day.
