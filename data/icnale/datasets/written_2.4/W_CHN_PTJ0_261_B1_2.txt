It seems that every college student wants a part-time job nowadays, which I think is not necessary. No one can deny the fact that doing a part-time job makes you nearer to the real world. Without having their parents to depend on for advice and guidence, fresh men need to improve their abilities of living and deciding things by themselves. At the same time, gaining some work experiences and sharpening their skills before graduating can be help in this competitive society. Also, popular as the concept——part-time job is, more and more students believe that the traditional kind of college life—— sitting in classrooms studying all day is just out of date. They tend to go out, seeking a chance to get an cool job. After all, making money on their own sounds extremely exerciting. However, at the negtive concern, problem arises that different from some developed countries, (where students commonly take part-time jobs and from where the word part-time job came)the money part-time jobs can provide in China is so little that almost no one can actually live on it and keep setting aside an appropriate amount of time for learning as well. So money is not the key of its popularity. For many of us, a part-time job may only add 10% to our pocket money. Another hidden problem may be serious. As part-time jobs apell millions of college students, some people manage to use their passion and make traps to get them in. They often pretend to offer you an good job, talk you in and persuade you pay all kinds of procedure charge. My roommate was beguiled of 1000 yuan last term without hesitation! The part-time job market is far from safe for we college students. From where I stand, part-time job can provide some help for poor students and improve abilities in some degree, but is never necessary for everybody.
