A part-time job is a good way for a student to learn many things that they simply cannot learn in a classroom. For example, by having a part-time job, I was able to learn about how to manage my own money and how to plan my finances for the entire month so that I know how much I need to make for rent and for food as well as for other expenses like entertainment. Also, I feel that I've become more responsible as a result of working part time because it has taught me how to manage my time and taught me how to prioritize my tasks in order to complete them in the most efficient way I can. This is a good skill that I simply did not develop well from college alone, so for students like me that need some extra ways in which to learn, part-time work is great because a can help you see the world from a new perspective and help you approach the same issues from different ways that will help you learn a skill that you needed to but couldn't previously. In conclusion, I think that having a part-time job is a great way for students to learn things that they may not have encountered if they stick only to studying for their classes.
