I agree because I am studying at college full-time and also working two part-time jobs which have been a real boon for me. I think that even though it has been a bit of a squeeze to fit everything in a lot of the time, I have learned a lot of tips and tricks to get the most out of my time, cut down the learning curve and for the first time in a long time, I haven't been throwing my money away as much as I used to. It has worked out for me and I have also learned a lot from my two bosses. I wouldn't say that it has been a lot of fun every day, but it hasn't been as bad as I thought and if I approach it in a methodical way, most things seem to fall into place fairly easily. I thought that my studies would suffer but they haven't because I found that if I just stick to my time schedules, I seem to get everything done OK. It is working out for me and provided that I stick to the new strategies and processes that I have learned, I believe that I won't run into to many major problems. This might not be the ideal thing for everyone else, but I can only say that it is working for me. I found that it was important for me to remember that some days, everything just doesn't go to plan and that there will be the odd stuff up here and there and that's OK because by sticking to my plans and schedule, it all gets sorted in the end.
