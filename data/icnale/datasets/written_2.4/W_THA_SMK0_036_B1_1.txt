In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for many reasons. First; it might have a bad effect on everyone in the restaurants. No matter what you smokes or you don't smoke, you are affected by unfresh air flowing around you. It means you body is in danger. If you are on the restaurant which fulls of smoking because the smoking is cause to many disease for example cancer or the disease which relate to a lung ect. Moreover, children can't come to the restaurant which allow to smoking. Restaurant should be the place where every member enjoy and be happy but it is not if the owner or manager of the restaurant allows smoking. Finally, it may support teenagers smoking. Because smoking is not banned at all restaurant. Teenagers or children see a bad thing. The result is they met smoke in one day. In the failure, it maybe reduces the average human's life time because smoking causes people having a weak body and respiratory disease. It is clear that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I do really agree and support the statement. I really hope that it could be real and everyone can make it happens.
