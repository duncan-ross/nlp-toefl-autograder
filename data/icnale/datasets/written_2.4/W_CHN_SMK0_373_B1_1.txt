 In recent years, more and more public places such as some restaurants and pubs announced a ban on smoking. This tendency attracts much attention and caused a social debating. Many people especially those smokers think this limit their legal rights and require no ban for smoking. But more people agree on it. I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but do you know that living with a smoker is even more harmful? The scientific research shows that the second-hand smoke is much more harmful than smoke a cigarette directly. So smoking in public places can do harm to others health. So in my opinion, no smoking in public places is fair and legal. The second point is that smoking in public can have bad influence especially on young people. Children lack the ability of judgment and like to imitate adults. So they are more likely to smoke when they grow up or even before they grow up. Ban on smoking can teach them a good lesson: smoking is bad, don't touch it. Smoking in public places is dangerous. It can set things on fire and cause disasters. Many people lost their lives because of a cigarette. According to these reasons, I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. No smoking makes a healthier and more harmonious society.
