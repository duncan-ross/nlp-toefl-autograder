Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is as all along the government has been taking measures to ensure that more places in Singapore are banned from smoking. Furthermore, at restaurants, we have gas and other equipment to process or cook the food. If smoking is allowed at such places, the chances of fire or an explosion will be higher if there were to be careless management of a lit cigarette butt. As the patrons of the restaurant vary, it is likely to have non-smokers as well and it is harmful to these people as well if they were to inhale smoke as they eat at restaurants. Besides, most restaurants in Singapore nowadays are air-conditioned; the air when mixed with smoke may end up becoming stale and uncomfortable for the people in the restaurant. Thus, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Even though this may result in the smokers going to other places or resorting to other measures to curb their addiction to nicotine, this measure is necessary to protect the non-smokers and give them the chance to prevent themselves from taking in second-hand smoke which is extremely detrimental to one's health.
