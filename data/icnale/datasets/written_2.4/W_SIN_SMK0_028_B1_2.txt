In Singapore, there is relatively low tolerance of smoking in public avenues. There usually exists smoking and non-smoking areas in places such as eateries, whereas shopping malls ban smoking altogether. Restaurants, on the other hand, are places of fine dining. Smoking is currently widely banned in restaurants in Singapore, with exceptions to certain open-air restaurants. In my opinion, the smoke emitted from cigarettes overpowers the smell of food, and such sensory details matter to diners. It would hence be inappropriate to permit smoking in enclosed dining areas. Even if the restaurant is located outdoors, it is arguable that the smoke may diffuse and affect other diners' appetites. On the other side of the coin though, smokers may be extremely comfortable in the presence of smoke when dining, and even prefer such an environment over one without any smoke. In order to cater to both kinds of diners, smoking should not be completely banned in resutaurants here in Singapore. Instead, restaurants should make their stand on smoking clear to diners, and restaurants should be identified as "non-smoking" or "pro-smoking" restaurants. A dual system in restaurants is worth contemplating, but there must be a physical segregation to ensure that the smoke does not penetrate into the non-smoking sections as consideration to the diners there.
