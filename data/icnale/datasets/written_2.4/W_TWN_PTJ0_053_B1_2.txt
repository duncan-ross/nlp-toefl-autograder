As an undergraduate student, I strongly regard that it is very important for a college student to take a part-time job. First, taking a part-time job can help you to accumulate your experiences of working. It can help you to be more mature and sophisticated. Having some working experiences also can make your resume more colorful. On the other hand, many senior citizens would tend to nicknaming the younger generation as a "peach generation" which means they much easier to get hurt and have low ability to deal with pressure. It is a really good chance for younger people to develop their endurable of pressure. This ability is crucial for young students when they take their first job. Third, to cultivate people networks is also a pressure to students. You may get acquaintance with someone who is influential to your further life and may make some friends who can make your lifetime happier. Last but not least, you can earn some money from your part-time job which can remind you that it is so hard to make money. You will value the money you own and you will not take your pocket which your parents give you for granted. Meanwhile you can prevent you will burn a hole in your pocket. To sum up, I firmly agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
