I agree that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. I believe that it instills responsibility, introduces them to the basics of workplace practices and ideally, gives them invaluable work experience. For the most part, many college students think that college is a vacation compared to high school and the workplace. They gain more freedom in that they are responsible for meeting course requirements without anybody standing over them or directing them which, some students see as a licence to just do enough to pass the course and party the rest of the time. By having a part-time job, they would realize that college is not one big party and that they also have certain obligations which have to be met, in order to reap the rewards for their labor. To be fair, some students want a part-time job anyway, so that they may pay for their degrees or just to have some extra cash. Either way, I think that all students should have a part-time job for the reasons mentioned above and it also gives them an opportunity to display whatever skills they may already possess or gain new skill sets. In the end, it will still look good for them on future job applications if it can be seen that they are willing to put out, in order to get something back.
