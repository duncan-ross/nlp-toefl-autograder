As an accountant, I believe that this is important and would go a long way towards improving student's financial education. Students can learn first hand, valuable financial skills such as budgeting, basic assets and liabilities assessment and the dollar value of compounding, as well as the implications that this can have on their financial futures. It is a great opportunity indeed, if they learn it, understand it and most importantly, apply it. I believe that students need to take a broader perspective when assessing the value of part-time jobs simply because it is more than just a little extra cash or immediate financial relief. I know from experience that while most colleges and financial institutions do teach sound financial basics, there are still many students who fail to understand the true power of numbers in the dollar sense. Further, I would say that there are many people who do learn sound money management but fail to develop true financial acumen which is more than just adding numbers, it is about investing prudently and having their investments work for them rather than them working for their investments. If students were taught true financial acumen and then learned to apply it much like'on the job training' with their earnings from part-time work, they would not only improve the quality of their own lives but if everyone also applied those principles, then it would surely give the economy a much needed boost.
