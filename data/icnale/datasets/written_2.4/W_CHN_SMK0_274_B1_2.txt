 As we all knows, smoking is harmful to our lungs, which will lead our body worse and worse. So I think it is necessary for us to let smoking be forbidden in public places. First of all, public places are for not only smokers but also nonsmokers. However, if the smokers smoke in public places, the nonsmokers have to breath the smoke into their body, which called second-hand smoke, is also harmful to their body. It is very unfair for those nonsmokers. Why do they have to breath in these harmful smoke? Secondly, I think smoking in public places is a very uncivilized behavior because this behavior will influence others in public places. Smoke will fill into the air and let the environment be very bad and uncomfortable. Then the less and less people will go to these public places. As a result this public place will be forgot and be useless. Besides, this will leave a very poor impression on the tourist. Last, the cigarette butts are also a very big problem. Smokers always throw their cigarette butts promiscuously which let the ground looks naughty and cause the fire. This will be dangerous. To sum up, there are lots of harm but no benefit. So why not let the smoking be forbidden in public places?
