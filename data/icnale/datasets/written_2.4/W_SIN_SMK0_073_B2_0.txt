I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several arguments for this ruling, however. Over the past few years in Singapore, smoking has become completely banned in indoor establishments, including dance clubs. Indeed, smoking is harmful and unfortunately affects all others in the vicinity. However, as long as cigarettes remain legal in the country, I believe smokers have the right to light up if they desire. In my opinion, completely banning smoking in every restaurant is impractical and pointless. The decision to allow smoking should instead rest on the restaurant's management. Making a blanket ruling on their behalf will be detrimental to business, as patrons would avoid such establishments if banned from unwinding with a cigarette while having a drink with friends, for example. Many eateries today have outdoor and indoor seating areas. Restaurants should have the liberty to designate smoking areas within the outdoor zones to keep their smoking customers. Banning the practice altogether may please some customers, but at high costs. Such customers can be pleased in more creative and practical ways as mentioned above. For many, cigarettes are a habit and an addiction. Refraining from smoking during mealtimes may be impossible for some. The onus is on the smokers themselves to be considerate when doing so.
