 I totally agree with the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons as follows. Smoking is a normal phenomenon in the social nowadays. Everyone knows its negative effects, but some men even women can't get rid of it. You will always see someone smoking in the public, because their cravings of tobacco break out and it is too hard to bear it. But both you and I know that if someone around us smokes, we are all affected by the second-hand smoking, especially babies. This behavior can also pollute the atmosphere and do harm to all the people who are served in the restaurant. Restaurants are places for people to eat and enjoy themselves. If people smoke there, those non-smokers will have to bear the terrible smell. The second-hand smoking of course will influence their health. Thus, in my option, we should ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country to prevent ourselves from the negative effects of smoking. And it is the government's duty to do something from now on to make the ban possible. Of course, we all should follow the rule and then we can enjoy safe meals in the all the restaurants in the near future.
