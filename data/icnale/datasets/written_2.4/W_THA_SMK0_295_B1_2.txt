What nutrient you get from smoking? I see nothing good for my health from smoking. Those who smoke are very unhealthy and are banned from people who don't smoke. Whoever is good looking always looks bad when smoking. Nowadays smoking is banned in many places such as at schools, hospital s especially at restaurants. And I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants because of two reasons. First, restaurants should be places for meal time not for smoking time. Everyone would like to enjoy meals without smoking. We all want to smell delicious food rather than cigarette's smell. Is the cigarette more delicious than food? If someone thinks it is, please get out off restaurants and enjoy smoking. Second, smoking destroys good atmosphere at restaurants and very bad for people's health especially people who don't smoke. They smell cigarette's smoke which is a second hand effect and cigarette's smoke affects people's health. If those who smoke use their money they spend on buying cigarette to buy healthy food, how healthy they are and how longer their lives will be. In short, there should be serious rules to control people who smoke. If they want to smoke, please get away from healthy people and enjoy their smoky world. People can be good looking without smoking. So, better give up right now. You will be one of charming people.
