I agree because I think that students should learn about financial responsibility which would empower them to have more control over their own lives. They would also learn about simple household budgeting and keeping their finances in order. They can also learn other skills such as simple workplace dynamics and most importantly, they would also be able to use the part-time job on their resumes to show that they have some sort of real work experiences. Their workloads would increase and they would have to learn to balance their time in such a way that they can keep a happy medium between there job and also not miss out on their study time. These may seem like basic things but many students may not have learned these things at home and might not been taught at their college. A lot of colleges do provide assistance with student guidance counsellors who could also advise the students and at least be able to provide some direction for any problems that students may encounter with their jobs and studies. The students would also come to realise the value of money because not too many part-time jobs that are available to students pay big wages. Since that would defeat the employers purpose of hiring cheap college labours.
