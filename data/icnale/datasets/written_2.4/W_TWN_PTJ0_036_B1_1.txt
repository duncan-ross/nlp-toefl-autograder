I think every college student should have a least one part-time job in his college life. Because with part-time jobs, you can accumulate your working experience. You won't be nervous when you are finding job or talking with the managers. Take my sister for example; she did part-time jobs when she was a college student. And she was willing to share her experiences on her motivation letter. Therefore she gets a job as soon as she was graduated. She knows how to deal with the problems and makes many friends in her company. Doing part-tine job can not only accumulate your experiences but also gain some money to keep ends meet. Moreover you can have a long-term plan in stock market. You are no more a student who just study and get good grades. You become a person who starts to design his own future and a person who can afford himself. But while you try to find a part-time job, remember, it's just " part-time " not " full -time. " you are still a student now, and you have to find a balance between your part-time job and school work. Last but not least, a part-time job is a good way to know the real society. So every college student should find a part-time during their school life.
