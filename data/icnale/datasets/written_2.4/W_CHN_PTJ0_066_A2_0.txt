There is a perception that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I consider it reasonable. I have some reasons below. First, the majority of the college students is grown-up and has the ability to take up a part-time job. Second, our college students should know the uneasiness of making money and take the responsibility to afford our own living expenses and help to share the family burden with our parents. Besides, we can get some working experience from it and make a better preparation for our future career. The more experience you have, the more attractive you are to the employers. No one will need a person who only has theory knowledge but without practical knowledge and experience. Furthermore, we can acquire some living skills and learn more about life and society while working so that we can survive the society with fierce competition and live a better life. In addition, we can get more chances to get along with people and communicate with them. In a word, we can learn much from doing a part-time job. So we can say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Try to find a part-time job when you have time.
