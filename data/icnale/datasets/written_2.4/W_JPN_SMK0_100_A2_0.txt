I agree with this opinion. I also think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is very bad for our health. It can cause heart disease, lung cancer or some serious illness. Of course people who smoke to be damaged but people who don't smoke also to be damaged for their health. People whom age is less than 20 are banned in law in Japan due to the influence for their health. But if people who is more than 20 years old smoke, the smog flow in the air. It means that everyone in the same space smoke as well as smoking people. There many kind of people in the restaurant. Secondly tobacco is very expensive because it contains high rate of tax. Tobacco is expensive and bad for our health. So buying tobacco is waste of money and time. As buying tobacco there is no profit for us. If we buy tobacco it is better to buy something that is good for our health no matter how it is a little expensive. If we want to smoke by all means we should go another limited room that is permitted to smoke or out of building.
