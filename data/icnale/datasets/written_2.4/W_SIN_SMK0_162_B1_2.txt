I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants include people from all ages, from the young to the old, and they are places for people to eat and enjoy their meals. If smoking is allowed at restaurants, those smokers will pollute the surrounding air. Not only smoking is harmful to the individual himself, it also has an adverse effect on the people near them. In terms of health, innocent parties around those smokers, whom are called second-hand smokers, may become prone to sickness. Furthermore, smoke particles will be left on the body of the first-hand smokers and his surroundings. Thus, if the next person were to be in contact with these particles unknowingly, they became third-hand smokers, which are in fact much more harmful for them. In this case, not just the smoker himself will suffer from chronic illnesses like lung cancer; the blameless parties around him will also be affected. Secondly, the smell from the smoke may be so overpowering that it covered the pleasant smell of the food. Especially in air-conditioned areas, it takes a longer time for the smell of smoke to be dispersed from one place to another. This decreases the happiness level of the customers as they no longer are able to eat with full satisfaction. Lastly, it is to protect the businesses of the restaurants, which in turn helped in the growth of the economy. In the case of Singapore, most people choose to go to indoor restaurants without a smoking corner. In conclusion, for benefits in the long run, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
