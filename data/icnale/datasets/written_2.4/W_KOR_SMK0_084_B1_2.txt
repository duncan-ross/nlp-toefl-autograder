Did you ever see No smoking in this area or Smoking is prohibited here? As many of you know smoking is bad for your health also secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. So many people designate non-smoking area and They disadvantage for smoker. But smoker's right important than non-smoker's right. They will say, "I'm the one who smokes. Mind your own business! Cigarette is an item of personal preference and the government collects taxes from smoker. In spite of that many other countries are also striving to decrease the number of smokers and have developed a variety of anti-smoking policies. Where smoker is's right? Are they criminal? I think that the government has agreed to lift restrictions on smoker and they're Induce smoker to decide to stop smoking. So restaurants divide the area in to two sections. One section is non - smoking area, the other section is smoking area then they're not going to complain to the government about this. Also smokers should try to keep a non-smoker's right. Then the government doesn't collect taxes and developed a variety of anti-smoking policies. And In this way, there will be less people smoking and it is possible that this dispute might disappear.
