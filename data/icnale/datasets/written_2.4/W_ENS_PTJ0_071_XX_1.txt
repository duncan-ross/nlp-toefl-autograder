Any student worth his salt knows that a part-time job is very important. If he has no part-time job, he has no proof that he is able to work. Getting good grades in school is just simply not a good way to show that you are ready to enter the business world; it only shows that you know how to take tests and study. In some ways, it does also show that you know how to work hard which is a valuable asset for a full time career, but, I would say that I have used almost none of the things I actually learned in college in my full time job. I listed myself as a student because I'm still attending one class to finish up my degree, but I have been working full time for almost a year. More than the actual knowledge that they teach you in college, I think that they teach you have to learn, which is a valuable thing to know how to do so that you can quickly adapt to new situations at your workplace. This is a skill that is the best developed through direct experience, and a part-time job will do wonders for your ability to apply things you learn in the classroom to real world situations.
