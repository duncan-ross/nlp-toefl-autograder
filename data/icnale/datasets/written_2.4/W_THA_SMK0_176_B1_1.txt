Everybody know about the effect of smoking is bad for health, but somebody still smoke it, moreover they smoke in public place. They are killing others in indirectly way. The smoker told when they smoked, they feel good and relax. when they stressed, they have to go to smoke and feel better, but I don't think like this. There are many bad effect from smoking. Heart and lungs was affected by smoking. If carbonmonoxide level in blood is higher, brain was limited to work and heart can stop working. In addition, heat destroy many organ, mouth, teeth, etc. So, If they told smoking make them feel good, it's not true. Because of after smoke in long time their health are worse and they will not feel happy as before. Today in Thailand, we have the law of smoking. the smoker can not smoke in any public place(restuarant, departmentstore, park, street, etc. ), but I found many smoker were smoking in many public place, restuarant, park, university, etc. The green house gas from factories, car, etc. that make the global warming is too much. If they still smoke, that will increase the disaster too. All of above I can't see any benefits of smoking. Smoking is bad for smoker, moreover it attack the victim who don't want to get it. it bad for health and the world. So I think, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
