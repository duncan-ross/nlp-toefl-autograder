In my opinion, I think college students should have a part-time job. First, it's a good chance for students get in touch with the society. As we all know that university is the first step of teenagers' entering the society. Having a part-time job can help them step into the society quickly. Second, I think doing a part-time job can make students better understand the difficulty of making money and the hardship of their parents. So it makes them become more mature than before. Third, I think having a part-time job is also a way of earning money so that we can reduce the burden of our parents. And we can also buy some things we like by ourselves. Now, there are many people aging from 20 to 30. They have the duty and ability to go to work. However, they still stay at home spending their parents' money after graduating from college. If they had had a part-time job and know more about the society, I think a majority of them wouldn't choose the way of staying at home doing nothing. Above all, I advise every college student to have a part-time job to nourish our lives.
