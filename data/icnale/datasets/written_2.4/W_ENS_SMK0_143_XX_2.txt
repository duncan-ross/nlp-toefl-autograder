Many people don't completely understand the effects of secondhand smoke and for some, they think of it as just being a nuisance. Statistics have shown that over one hundred thousand people die every year as the result of passive smoking. While it is probably an underestimated figure, it serves as a timely reminder that passive smoking kills too many innocent people. Public awareness is increasing however and many people, all over the world are starting to take a stand against smoking in public places including restaurants. While Japan does have several restaurants that enforce a no smoking policy, I believe that this is mostly because of building or department store regulations rather than any thought of how smoking may affect their customer's. If enough people speak up, then governments have to sit up and take notice if they want to be re-elected. On that basis, I feel that it is crucial that society as a whole stands as one and rather than condemn smokers, continue to vote only for those representatives who will take up the cause in government and push for sufficient legislation to ban smoking in restaurants as well as in all public places. Only in this way, can long-term change take affect and society in general, like it usually does, will eventually toe the line.
