I Strongly agree, The smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is one type of drug that is harmful to themselves and those around the body and Personality is not good. Smoking in restaurants is a very important social manners and into the restaurant all look forward to relaxing. But if there is cigarette smoke and smell. No relaxation will not feel uncomfortable to live the consequences is. Mental bad. Body is not strong. And stress. Restaurant as a place for relaxation, Most of the restaurant customers want convenience. Clean and safe. If the smoking freely in restaurants. Will damage the image of the restaurant. It is not attractive. The present this concept is very popular worldwide. But in the process successfully most countries are strong and growth. Because countries with strong and security. Will see the importance of people and self image in their countries. In Thailand, Help the campaign was successful only in part. Because the media campaign has limited and published less in Thailand. So we must help the campaign seriously. Safety for self and others And prosperity of the country. I will try to be a part of helping a non-smoking restaurant and not just in restaurants only but in Thailand, It must be non-smoking as well.
