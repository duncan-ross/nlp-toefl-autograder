Recently the result of a survey has shown that the majority of Chinese think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants nationwide. Obviously, people always will not make an agreement on the same issue. Some others consider it very terrible to allow people to smoke in restaurants. For me, I am in favor of the former opinion. The followings are my reasons for my points of view. Firstly, as we all know, smoking harms people' heath, especially there are so many people in the restaurant, which includes children there. Secondly, with the rising income, more people would like to restaurant to have their dinners or enjoy the time with their friends. So most of people hope that the environment of the restaurant is more comfortable rather than dirty. Besides, some people think that smoking can make him relax when he is in trouble. In fact, only if they have a good motion, everything will be fine. Last but not least, if a person smoke in public, I believe that most people don't like him,. Because he doesn't take care of others' feeling, the kind of people is not popular among people. Of course I don't mean that we cannot smoke in all public places. After all, smoking also brings some advantages. To put it in a nutshell, I insist that don't disturb others when you smoke.
