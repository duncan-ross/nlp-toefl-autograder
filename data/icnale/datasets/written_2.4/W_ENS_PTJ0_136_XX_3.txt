There are many benefits for students who do engage in part-time work at college such as providing valuable work experience that will improve future labour market prospects. Even if it means taking on some volunteer work, especially if they can do this in a sector that is related to their career choice, it will all help when it comes time to go job hunting. This will also allow students to gain some hands on experience which will give them a more realistic view of what kind of work their career will revolve around. The job market is highly competitive these days and job seekers face some stiff competition from highly motivated graduates and experienced workers who may perhaps all be vying for the same job. It is critical that students give themselves as many advantages that they can and it is never too early to start building upon their skills base, They never know when they might need those skills and the time spent on the job while still at college, will never prove to be a waste. While it may require some additional dedication and time management skills, the advantages gained from this undertaking, far outweigh the minor sacrifices that might be required.
