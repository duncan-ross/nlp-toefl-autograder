Part-time jobs are a very important part of the college experience for many students because they need to make some money in order to support their living situation. Only a few select individuals are lucky enough to have parents that can completely from all the costs of a modern college tuition, which are quite high, so many kids are forced to start working at a young age in order to supplement the funding that their parents can provide. I think this is a great lesson in the way the real world works, that is, not everything is all rainbows and sunshine, and not everything will always work out how you want it to work out. The bad part of this is that it will place unnecessary stress on students who are already buried with schoolwork, and as a result of their actual educational experience may be negatively affected. Truthfully, there are both benefits and negative aspects to part-time work in college, but for many students it is simply a fact of life, and many students have learned to deal with it quite well. I have personally held a part-time job since I enrolled in college over five years ago, so this background may make my opinion somewhat biased.
