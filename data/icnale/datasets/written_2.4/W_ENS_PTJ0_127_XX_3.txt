I have mixed feelings about the matter of whether college students should have part-time jobs or not. The ideal situation would be for students to be able to focus on their studies and not have to worry about work. I know for my own experience that working part-time can cut into your study time and also make you tired, preventing you from doing your best in your academic work. Therefore, students should do everything they can to secure alternate sources of funding before they enroll in universities. Sources of funds that are available include grants, scholarships, and student loans. It is best to take care of this while still in high school so money will not be a concern when actually enrolled in college. However, many students do not have access to these sources of funding. Also, students may come from low income backgrounds and thus unable to receive support from their families. In such cases, getting a part-time job in order to make ends meet may be unavoidable. If that is the case, students should try to find jobs that will not interfere with their academic work. For example, if they have a strenuous job that makes them tired, it could prevent them from working on their academic pursuits to the best of their ability. Therefore, such draining jobs should be avoided. Also, the number of working hours should be kept to the minimum possible in order to prevent work from interfering with school.
