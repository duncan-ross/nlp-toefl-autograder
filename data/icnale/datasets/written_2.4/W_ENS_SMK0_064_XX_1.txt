I don't know much about restaurants in Japan, but I know that personally I think that smoking should definitely be banned at restaurants in the US. From this perspective, I will make my argument assuming that many people in Japan feel the same way as I do on both sides of this issue. It will be in more important in the coming years to ban smoking in order to eventually cull it out of our cultures. Smoking is kind of an old fashioned thing and it doesn't really have a place in the modern world. I think this because back in the day when smoking was not well understood, many people thought it made you more of a man or sexier to smoke a cigarette, so there was an incentive to smoke a cigarette. However, nowadays, we all know that smoking is very bad for you, and so now there's an incentive to quit smoking if you are a smoker or to not begin smoking in the first place. Banning smoking at restaurants would allow both of these two goals to be achieved, and the sooner smoking is banned in the restaurants, the sooner we can see the end of smoking as a whole.
