Being a college student nowadays does not comprise only of burying oneself underneath all those books. Rather, I see the period of college life as a golden opportunity for the building of one's character and exploring what it is like beyond academic matters. Moreover, it is during college that one has a very flexible schedule, thus enabling college students to efficiently plan and fit in part-time jobs so conveniently. Hence, I agree that part-time jobs are something which college students should have a chance to be exposed to. Speaking from my own experiences (having attended college for about four years now) as well as the testimonies from my seniors, when one tries to remember college life, it is the poignant learning experiences which make a difference rather than the convoluted theories of classic writers or other kinds of social scientists. It would truly be a pity if one's memories of his or her college life were merely the struggles and sleepless nights caused by the stress felt with the thought of the next presentation or essays. Having a part-time job, however, would take the boredom out of the highly ritualised life of studies. For one, it would be a good break from hitting the books. Secondly, research has also shown that many hours of cramming information inside one's head is not an efficient study solution. Rather, studying efficiently within a certain amount of time set apart solely for the cause of studying would be a better solution. People who would critic the taking up of part-time jobs should thus not worry about part-time jobs taking away precious time from studying and pursuing academic success. Yet, while I advocate the use college students to take up a part-time job, I also emphasise on the need to balance one's time well. It would not be wise to devote too much time to work at the expense of one's studies.
