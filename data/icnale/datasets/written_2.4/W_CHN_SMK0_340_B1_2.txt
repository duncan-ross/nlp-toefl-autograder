 I'm completely for the idea that banning smoking at all the restaurants. I even hope that banning smoking could be conduct at all public situations. As is known to all, smoking is unhealthy. It will bring cancer to the one who smoke. And the serious effect is not only for the smokers, but also the people around the smokers. In a restaurant, whether large or small, there are always so many people seated, eating and more importantly, breathing. Once there is a person smoking, the smell flows. It is just like a terrorist making a gas bomb gone off. Then suddenly the surrounding will be full of that smell and many people will begin to cough and feel sick. On the other hand, the smell of smoking will no doubt make the other customers feel that the food in the restaurant isn't yummy. And they will comment that this restaurant is not a good destination for dinners. In that way, it may reduce the restaurant's reputation. Of course the smoker won't think that it is them who add the bad reputation to the restaurant, so the only way to prevent the restaurants from losing customers is banning smoking. Now that there is no good to smoke in the restaurants, we should ban it completely.
