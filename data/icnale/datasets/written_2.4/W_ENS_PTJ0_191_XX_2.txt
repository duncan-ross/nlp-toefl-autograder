I agree because it gives students several opportunities. First and foremost, I believe that it gives students responsibilities and obligations that must be met. Then let's not forget that they are also getting real job experience. With the job experience makes money and also any additional job skills that are necessary to perform their tasks. What usually carries over into college is that they learn to prioritize their workloads, organize their studies so that they may assimilate information in a more orderly and easier to remember process. Unless they are stressed out, their ability to focus is usually more heightened and they tend to maximize their time more efficiently. When they leave college and their part-time jobs, they usually do so having acquired not just learning skills or information, but tools and techniques that will carry them in good stead regardless of what job they get. If by chance they should find themselves in between jobs, they may be able to seek different kinds of work that their skills base may be transferred to. We know that many skills are transferable and see this in the business world quite frequently so this should be no different in a newly graduated student's case.
