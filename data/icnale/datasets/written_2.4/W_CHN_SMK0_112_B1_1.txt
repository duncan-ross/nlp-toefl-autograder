Nobody will deny that smoking is a scissors that cutting down the lives of the smokers as well as the smoke inhalers. In nowadays, many countries have carried out some measures to ban smoking in the public areas to reduce the harm of smoking to the least. But in our country, smoking still can be seen everywhere. I think some measures must be taken to diminish or ban smoking in some particular places like restaurants. There are some kinds of public areas in China gathering the most people like gardens, public squares, restaurants, etc. Different from the open areas of garden or square, the room of restaurants is closed and that makes air not circulate as easily as that in the outside. So smoke will linger in the room as long as possible, making the atmosphere inside bad for everyone in the room, especially for the children and the pregnant women. It has been claimed by the scientists that the passive smoke inhalers gain more harm to their health than the smokers themselves. So the restaurants have been becoming dangerous places for the passive smokers if smoking can't be banned there. It's time for the government to do something to clear up the atmosphere in the restaurants.
