I think part-time job is not that good for college students. Part-time job which college students can do is very limited. Restaurant serving, coffee shop, tutoring and so on. It can take way too much time, so most of the college students who have part-time job don't have enough time to study their major, do their homework, even sleep. Many students must make their allowance, because university tuition is very high. However, I think it is better to get a scholarship instead of making money through part-time job. There is another problem. I had made my allowance myself from the first grade to third grade of university. I earned a lot of money with tutoring, also I spent all of the money I had earned. The more I made money, the more I spent. The amount of consumption was increasing at that time. Now, I am fourth grade, and I don't have time to do a part-time job. I can't afford to take my high and big consumption habbit. I think students' job is study hard not that making money or spending money. So I don't agree with this sentence' It is important for college students to have a part-time job. '
