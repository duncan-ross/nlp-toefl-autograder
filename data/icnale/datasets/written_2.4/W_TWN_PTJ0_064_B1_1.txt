I'm strongly agree that college students should have a part-time job. Instead of put the students' nose in the book all day long, accumulate working experience is kind of "study" before they have graduated. And it is a big challenge. There are many sort of part-time jobs around this modern society. So, how to select the best job for we students? I think there are several conditions which we must concern about. First, we have to check our schedule. This is very important because under the pressure of studying and earning money, time is everything. Second, we have to check the content of jobs. That no need to say, we have to protect ourselves, and do what we can only do. The last one is to find the balance between school and part-time job. However, learning at school is the most important thing now in our life. Being a student, we can do whatever do want to do, but don't forget we are now only a student. Otherwise, our family may worried a lot about us. If we can find out the best way between school and part-time job, then it will be a successful beginning of our college life. So, find a part-time job, and then enjoy it!
