When students enter college, they often find that they have much more free time than they did in high school. As a result, many students decide to apply for part-time jobs to earn extra money. In my opinion, it is important to for college students to work part-time jobs. I have two reasons for this. First, most college students do not have much money to spare for their hobbies and extracurricular activities. Hobbies and extra-curricular activities are vital to enriching the life as a college student. Through these activities, students can make new friends or discover their talents. However, if students did not have the money to enjoy these activities, they would be missing out on these significant chances, and they would not be able to make the best of their time in college. So, in order to prevent this, it is important for college students to earn money to spend on their pastime. Also, getting work-experience can help students understand the value of money. Understanding the value of money is not only important in college, but it is an important sense throughout a person's life. Without this sense, students would not have any idea on how to spend money, and they could waste great amounts of money without realizing how much damage it could cause to them. In order to have students get a sense of how important money is, they should understand how difficult it is to earn money. This is why I think that it is important for students to get work-experience while they are still in college.
