I agree that part time job is important for university students. Not only can we earn some money, but also learn work experience. In the respect of part time job salary, if university students have their own economics ability, they can do more things that they really want to do, such as studying aboard or learning other things that they interested in. They don't have to worry about money and have colorful school life. Another good thing is that they don't have to ask money from their parents. Part time job also offer some social training for students. University students can experience social environment and learn some skill that can not learn in campus. Students can also make friends with various people in different ages and jobs. From these different background people, students can learn a lot including lifestyle, life experience, and social skill and so on. I think it's vital for university students to have a part time job. However, it's necessary to take a balance between part time job and school homework. Although taking a part time job can earn money and get work experience, school homework is also important. Every student who has part time can not forget their duty- Studying. But if students have no idea to spend their free time, taking a part time job is a good choice for them.
