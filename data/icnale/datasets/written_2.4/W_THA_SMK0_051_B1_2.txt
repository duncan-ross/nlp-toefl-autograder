One of the pollutions that close to us is toxic fumes from a cigarette. A cigarette is a small roll of finely cut tobacco leaves wrapped in a cylinder of thin paper for smoking. I have seen the smoker since age that I can remember the things. I am second hand cigarette smoke. I don't like this but I can't avoid every time. People know that smoking is bad for everyone but cigarettes can be sold in every market and every shop and they are convenient to buy by everyone who has age more than 18 years old. I think it is wrong to do like this. If we want to stop, we will destroy all of them. My uncle told me that the old day, the teenager smoked for fashion. They believed that smoking make they're cool. And I think nowadays they still like the past. Some smokers smoke because they were serious. I think they have another solution but they don't try to do. A person in my family is addicted to smoke. He smoke and smoke. In a day he smokes more than a pack of cigarettes. I don't want him to be like that. Now he's very weak and dowdy. His healthy is extremely bad and not as lively as before. This's one of the illustrations about smoking. I would like the smokers concern their health and care their self along with their family. Please, stop smoking before smoking stops you.
