Imagine yourself confined to an area with polluted air. You look at your food and it seems contaminated. You slowly munch on the contaminated food and it tastes awful. The surroundings are all filled with smoke dust and ashes. That was the exact scenario which happened to me when I was dining in a cafe in Europe. A Caucasian diner seated next to me lighted his cigarette and started puffing away. I was completely turned off because my food had subconsciously become poisonous to me. Therefore, I would vote for smoking to be completely banned at all the restaurants in Singapore. I believe every diner would like to enjoy the ambience, quality food and excellence service while paying top dollars at a restaurant. However if someone were to smoke in the restaurant, none of us would be able to indulge in that perfect dining experience. In addition, there is no need to discuss further about the negative and harmful impact of smoking on human health. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for the good of the public. Lastly, it is essential to get the message across to all visitors and tourists too. No doubt they might perceive Singapore as a "fine" city, then again, we are uniquely Singapore.
