I agree. I think that it goes without saying nowadays that nearly all college students will have to get a part-time job aside from any internships that they might do, unless of course it is a paying internship which there don't seem to be many of in the last couple of years. Why this sudden change. Well, I guess the economy has something to do with it and money is tight in most families in the USA right now. So students have to take matters into their own hands if they want extra dollars. I used to get thinking and get told that it was mainly for the work experience you know, like an internship. I'm not saying that internships are not important any more. It is just that right now, money seems to be the big problem so if the families have got any extra dollars to give the students, then it falls back to student s to pull their weight and chip something in too. Even an extra twenty or thirty dollars a week can help and it's not like they have to try and make a hundred grand part-time, just whatever they can to get along OK.
