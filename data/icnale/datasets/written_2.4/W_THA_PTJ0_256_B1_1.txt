College students should have a part time job because Part-time jobs are great work for a collage. These can be students, or people who don't need to make a great deal of money. People who desire to do something worthwhile with some of their time, or people who only to supplement another income. It can do in the evening of days, weekend, and the end of semester. Although it doesn't make a lot of money but those moneys might build the pride gives with yourself. Most college students will want extra money that apart from their allowance, if they have one. The extra money becomes a symbol of freedom to them, so that when they want to go somewhere, such as the store, they can buy what they want. The student can make your life easier by focusing on finishing school and then working later on. In fact, there are years of work available for the student after graduation. A better way to spend one's time is to volunteer or to do summer jobs. This way, no other "responsibility" gets in the way of one's schoolwork. They are not able to compete with experienced and better educated candidates, they can start with something smaller about their part-time jobs.
