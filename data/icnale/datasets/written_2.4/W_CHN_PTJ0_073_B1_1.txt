Many people regard that college students should do some part time job because college students should come into contact with society. But I oppose college student only do some part time job but not do their theoretical knowledge well. Many students don't want to do their college homework, so the part-time job became the best excuse of tier lazy. But in other hands, college student have taken 12 years education in primary school and middle school and they have no chance to come into contact with society. so there are in inseparable connection between in social practice and heir college theoretical knowledge, we can't only do our social practice like part-time job but to do our theoretical knowledge, just like a primary school student can't do part time job. In the opposite side, if we only do our theoretical knowledge, we can't develop our social ability. It will become a serious problem of that we can't find a suitable job. But it's obvious that college theoretical knowledge is more important than having a part time job. Generally speaking, in our college, we should do our college theoretical knowledge well firstly. After that, if we have more time and energy, we can do some part time job for earning some money, accumulating social experience and so on. But if have some problem in our college study like studying or students' union, we should do our schoolwork first.
