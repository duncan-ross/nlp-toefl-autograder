 Nowadays more and more part-time jobs turn up. And the jobs have enormous attraction to college students. As a result, to take a part-time job seems to have become a fashion in college. Of course there are many people Those who support students to take part-time jobs have their accounts. For instance, they think students can put their knowledge leant in class into practice, and though this process they can know whether their comprehension to the very thing is right and obtain some new knowledge that they can't learn from class. In addition some students come from poor families need to take part-time jobs to earn money or they may have to stop their schooling, which is really a pity. Yes, there are many advantages of part-time jobs, but as the saying goes, every coin has two sides. As some people say, taking a part-job costs too much time which should be used to study. In that case, students' study would surely be influenced. That is not worth the candle. In my opinion, the advantages of taking a part-time job outweigh the disadvantages. Apart from the reasons above, I think we can improve our ability through this process and adapt to the society better.
