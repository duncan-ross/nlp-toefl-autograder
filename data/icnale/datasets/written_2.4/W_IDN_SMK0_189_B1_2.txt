Restaurants are places where people enjoy their breakfast, lunch or dinner. A place where a person enjoy their time with their family, friends, or even business partner. They all come in a very good mood, wishing that they could eat something delicious and not feeling hungry anymore. But sometimes, it doesn't go well because they feel annoyed with the smoke from someone who is smoking nearby. For them who are used to the smoke, they will feel fine. But how about the person who don't like it at all and even get sick because of the smoke? In some restaurants, they have already parted non-smoking place and smoking place, but some have not. Such restaurants will force their guests who don't like smoking to sit together with the other guests who like smoking. In Jakarta, smoking in public places have already being forbidden. But in other city, the rules haven't been applied. For example Surabaya. We still find so many restaurants with smoking guests everywhere. Such thing should be banned already. The smokes from cigarettes are harmful to others. It is more harmful to them who don't smoke at all than to them who smoke. Not only harmful, smokes from cigarettes can annoy other people. Sometimes it makes the others cough or even cannot breathe. Such conditions will make the restaurant less comfortable than it has to do. People will no longer find it comfortable and they will not want to come anymore. To anticipate such thing, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Or at least, the restaurants must provide a smoking room part from a non-smoking room. Therefore it will no longer disturbed or annoyed anyone.
