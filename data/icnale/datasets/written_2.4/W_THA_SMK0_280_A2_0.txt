I believe everyone knows smoking don't have benefit. However, many people smoke with concern dangerous. Today, not only the man smokes but also women smokes. Moreover, the youths who are student. It is seemed simple thing because don't have enactment of forbid smoking and it's personal right. Someone smokes by disregard other else around. You know smoking is dangerous with other else? Smoker get only carbonic-acid gas 20-30 % but people around smoke get more carbonic-acid 70-80 % and result in cancer. So it's not fair for people don't smoke. I feel moody and headache when I smell smoke. The bed thing I smell smoke when I have lunch in restaurant. I think it's very false thing and not appropriate. It make my food is very unclean and disturb having lunch. It performs no have politeness and respect of living in society. Some places are forbidden smoking or set place for smoker. However, the all restaurant should be place without smoking for good sanitation. People in the restaurant want benefit from food not dangerous from smoking. So I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it's thing support eating and makes no have risk about cancer.
