I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some smokers have insisted that they have a right to smoke without restriction. Of course, they have a right to enjoy what they love everywhere and every time. But their right is protected only when their right doesn't affect other people. To make other people's health bad by smoking in public places is one of the worst crimes. Especially, a restaurant is the place where there are many kids. These innocent kids breathe in bad air because of irresponsible smokers. While they have a right to enjoy smoking, the kids also have a right to protect their health. However I know it is an extreme way to ban smoking completely at once. So I'd like to suggest a way. Not to make the cigarette smoke leak from the smoking room at the restaurant owner should make some places for the smokers outside the building. Because smokers and non-smokers are at the same place even though they made some places for them in the restaurant. But we should bear in mind the fact that the most perfect way to prevent the secondhand smoking is to quit smoking.
