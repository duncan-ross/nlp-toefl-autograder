College is considered to be a springboard for every individual into life. The reason for this is that college prepares you to which ever career you will pursue when you turn into adult. It requires a lot of focus and concentration for you to be able to exhaust all possible chances of learning and yearning. In my opinion, having a part time job in the course of one's college life isn't really necessary, not unless it is tremendously needed. It would just, no matter what circumstances, give students a hard time. There is already pressure applied on trying to maintain good grades and not failing, more so when you have another matter to worry about when you walk out of the university gate. Maybe some people will find it easy to juggle around tasks but for most, it isn't. And that majority is better off setting their eyes to a straight path towards graduating with a degree. I 'm not saying it is impossible to graduate from college when having a part time job; the only thing is it would be harder, and there would be less of a peace of mind. Wouldn't anyone like an easier way to deal with something that is complicated such as college?
