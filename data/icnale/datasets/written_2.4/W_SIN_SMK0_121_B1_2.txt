I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Singapore. One reason for my agreement is the harms of second hand smoke to the innocent people around the smoker. Exposure to second hand smoke would increase the risk of a non-smoker to diseases such as lung cancer. In my opinion, it is utterly selfish of the smoker to smoke in front of people who are determined not to take part in this self-harming activity. Another reason is that a restaurant is essentially a place for people to gather and enjoy a good meal. To smoke in such a public place is inconsiderate and would affect the enjoyment of the restaurants' customers in their meals. We should respect our fellow diners and refrain from doing something that would ruin their meal. Furthermore, children are frequently present in such establishments, and smoke from cigarettes could result in their breathing difficulties or choking. In addition, being exposed to older humans smoking could give these impressionable children the notion that smoking is "cool" and is a normal part of life without showing them the accompanying side effects. To sum up, I feel that to smoke in restaurants is not just disrespectful to the other patrons but is also harmful to them, hence my support for the complete banning of smoking at all restaurants in Singapore.
