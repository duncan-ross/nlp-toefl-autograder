I am strongly agree. Because smoking will do you and people in the restaurants bad healthy. Besides inside the restaurant have bad smell. When a lot of people in the restaurant receive bad smell, it was done yours bad healthy. Perhaps I think, should have regulation for restaurant. Or when have person smoking in the restaurant, the owner fine person. And smoking has pollution in the restaurant. Cigarette was done people bad healthy. The owner of the restaurants should put a big sign in front of the restaurants that no smoking in this place. If all the restaurant bane smoking, it reduce people to smoke because no one welcome. I go to the restaurant and someone smoke, I ask him to stop smoking and he ignore so I ask the owner to change my table. I still smell the cigarettes so I ask them to check my table and I go out. If the restaurants don't allow smokers, they won't lost a customer who don't like smoking. Smoking make people have lung cancer and mouth cancer. It's very suffering when dying. I see many pictures about people who have cancer from smoking. It's very dangerous and disgusting. I really hope that it will be completely banned soon.
