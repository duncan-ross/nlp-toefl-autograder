Many students in college have done the part time job. This phenomenon is very general. So do I, I did a restaurant waiter last summer vacation. In that time, I felt very happy. Although being a waiter was happy, I faced many challenges in the beginning. First, I had to remember all the names of dishes on the menu and introduce to customers. Second, there were a lot of dirty dishes and bowls I had to wash. Sometimes, I had to stand the complaint from customers or the blame from the boss. I felt very tired in the initial stage. Gradually, I was familiar with my job. I knew how to communicate with customers and solve the problems by myself. I was not in a great bustle anymore. I also learn some easy recipes and I can cook delicious food at home. Now, I am good at cleaning the dishes and cooking. Doing the part time job makes me earn much money and learn more experiences. Some working experiences will be very useful and helpful in the future. I also make a lot of friends through the part time job. Doing the part the job gives me a different experience.
