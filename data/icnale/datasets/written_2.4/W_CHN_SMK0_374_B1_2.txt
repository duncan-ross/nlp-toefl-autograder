 Since my dad is a faithful fan of cigarette, I have long been the victim of second hand smokes and no one knows better than me the feeling of having someone smoking beside you. To save the mass from this terrible suffering, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Being crowded barely ventilated and full of odor of all sorts, it tortures us to breath at the ordinary restaurants. As is always the case, smoking always turns out to be the culprit. We need to say more about the harm to health of second hand smokes. It's a must to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Without the consideration of health, smoking also ruins the heartwarming feeling of having lunch with someone you love or eat alone quietly. Without the pressure of competition and with the pleasure of enjoying good foods, restaurants mean a pure land of many people. But smoking drives all this away. All we want to do is filling the stomach and hush away or drive the creep away. There is really a long list of disadvantage of smoking in restaurants. So we really think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
