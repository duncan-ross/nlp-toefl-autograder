 All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. The college students need to work hard in their studies to get good grades. But some students who cannot afford their expenses do part time jobs. This affect their studies badly. They cannot make their way to good universities, to go in a profession of their choice. They find no time to do their homework. Part time jobs also affect the health of students. They try to do their homework and thus, have no time to sleep. They cannot take meals at regular times. Part time jobs make the students frustrated. They find no time for themselves, no entertainment, no refreshment. This affect their nature badly. Working round the clock makes them like a machine and spoil their personality. The age, they have, to enjoy and to live life like what it deserve, is gone in this period. And this time practice takes away their youth and makes them older enough, so that their lives become so dry and mechanical. Thus, students in trying to live on their own or to help their parents not only disturb their health but also their personalities and their future. There should be organizations to help such students. We must care of our future and today's students are the future.
