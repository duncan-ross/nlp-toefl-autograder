During the summer following graduation in high school, students are searching for a way to equip themselves to be a diverse college student. As for me, I applied a foreign part time job in the US to realize my dream of traveling abroad. I worked at the Yellow Stone National Park as a waiter in a hotel. Of course, this kind of hard job is far from a comfortable trip. However, I enjoyed it a lot. My job was to clean up the rooms and the wooden house outside where the sun shine burned like a fireplace all day. What's worse, the cars in the wooden house we used to carry things are much heavier than those provided in the hotel. All of my partners prayed every morning for not being assigned to word there. It was me that asked my boss to make me work in the wooden house. I can't stand seeing the upset faces of whoever had to work there. My boss was astonished of this. She said, "A Taiwanese girl? Aren't worried about getting dark skin?" I said, "No, I love sunshine. " So that was it. On the first day I worked there, I got failed to pull that heavy car and got hurt by it. Fortunately, my friends helped me to see a doctor, and my boss paid all the money. The experience of having a part time job added warm and hard-working attitude in my personality which is unavailable in textbooks. I think a part time job is important for college student as a way to build good habits in life but not a way for earning money.
