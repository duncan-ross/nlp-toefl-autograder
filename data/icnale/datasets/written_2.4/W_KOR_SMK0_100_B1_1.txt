I think cigarettes are bad in the body. But I am smoking. I tried everything trying to stop smoking failed. Difficult and painful, when i want a cigarette. It became a habit. I can stop for a while there should be a cigarette. I know now i can stop the tobacco that it is not. When the trial period is rather more smoking. When it became the first smoking were 20 years old. I regret that time. If I do not smoke then I would not have a cigarette is not. Give up smoking during the supposed decline of the difficult, but it is not difficult at first. Those who do not smoke I do not want to recommend. Because Cigarettes do not help anything. Also need to stop smoking is because of the money disappears. And most importantly, your body is not good. Of people who smoke and cause other people to see the damage can be. This situation will be bled. People who do not smoke are harmful to having a bad action. I've been smoking four years, but I'm trying to quit smoking. To stop smoking, my body healthy and I save the money. I'll try to do so.
