It's a tough market out there these days and students may need more than a degree to get the job that they are after. Even positions that are not related to career choice will still prove helpful and be looked at favourably by prospective employers. Having this experience on their resume, will also display the basic qualities that most employers look for such as; reliability, some form of work ethic and reliability. Students would also acquire some basic work skill sets as well as gain an insight into what life is like in the workplace. Some arguments against working part-time while studying at college tend to zero in on one major point. That being, students need to focus all the time on studying and working part-time cuts into their precious study time. Personally, I don't think that this is a valid argument if students follow the lead of other successful students who have managed to do both quite readily by employing some sound time management and solid organization skills into their repertoire. In short, having a part-time job will allow students to become more employable, give them a slight edge in their job hunting activities and it will also give them some extra cash to play with.
