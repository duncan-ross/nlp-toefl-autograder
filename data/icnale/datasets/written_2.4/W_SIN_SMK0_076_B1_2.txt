Smoking is generally deemed to be a social vice by many. The issue of whether smoking should be made illegal in food establishments is debatable. While the majority --- non-smokers --- would welcome this move due to its benefits of reducing air pollution and lowering health-related problems, smokers would frown upon this decision as it would cause severe inconveniences to them. This essay shall attempt to illustrate that while smoking should be banned at restaurants, the management should take into consideration the plight of smokers and allocate a designated spot for them to take a puff. Smoking should be banned at restaurants as it would provide a cleaner environment for patrons.
