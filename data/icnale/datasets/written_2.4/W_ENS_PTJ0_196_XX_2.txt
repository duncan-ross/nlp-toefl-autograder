From a logical standpoint, it would seem that having a part-time job in college would be a great way for students to become more responsible and expand their experiences. However, I often feel that my students are placed into a situation of too much stress and I can see very directly the link between sliding grades and part-time employment. In the worst cases, students will come to me sometimes in a state of tears crying that they do not have enough time to do all the work I assign. However, this makes me wonder what their motivation for coming to college was in the first place, as my classes and the classes of many other professors were designed very carefully to challenge students and to help them learn, and the fact that part-time work is an important enough pursuit to get in the way of this does not reflect well upon the institution of academia in general. However, I find that some work study positions especially in the library are particularly conducive to maintaining a good balance between work and study time as students are allowed to do some small amount of schoolwork while they are on duty. I hope that the times will one day change so that students can focus more of their time on completing schoolwork to a high degree of quality.
