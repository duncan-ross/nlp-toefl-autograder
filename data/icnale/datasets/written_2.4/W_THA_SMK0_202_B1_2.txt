My opinion about this topic is it's good idea that has a good place for smoking. In the present have many people smoking include women too. And the restaurant in the country ought to find good place for smoking because they will smoking in the restaurant and it's make another that didn't smoking accept toxic fumes too. So if restaurant have little place for smoking I think its good way for solve problem. Or that restaurant might have an air vent pipe for release bad air out from restaurant. There are also another way to solve this problem such as showing sign for not allow smoking the areas, inform the customers in advance whether the restaurant provide place for smoking or not. If it is possible, as I mentioned, it is good idea to have spate room for smokers and non smokers. The air condition room should not allow smoking but if they wish to smoke in air condition room, the restaurant should find the way to release the smoke out of the restaurant. It is not idealistic but it is possible for practical. Many restaurants are successful for separating places for each kind of customers. So I think it is about the management of the restaurants, how much and cleaver they can handle it. it is not about to ban them but how to control them.
