Smoking may be a tradition for centuries or even millennia for many people around the world and that tradition had reached the Philippines. You can see smokers in most of the places you will go in Metro Manila. It is alarming that even our country has a law that forbids people from public places like streets, malls and restaurants there are still many who are doing it. If there should be somewhere in I want to totally ban smoking cigarettes, it would be in restaurants. I chose restaurants because the air is not circulating that much unlike with mall which is a larger place and unlike streets where it is open space. Also, in the restaurants, the people are sitting there for a long time so they would be exposed much longer than the people who are just passing by in the mall and streets. If the government could not totally ban smoking cigarettes in all places in our country, I would just ask them to ban it in restaurants. This is just an iota of what should be implemented but this is more possible in our country and somehow make a positive effect. I would like to see small laws that are implemented rather than the big ones that are just written.
