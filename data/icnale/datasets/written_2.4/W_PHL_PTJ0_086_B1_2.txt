Nowadays, a number of college students get involved in part-time jobs. For some, it is a financial necessity. For others, it is an opportunity to gain some experience in their career or field of interest. If my opinion was asked, I would recommend having part-time jobs in college. Here are my reasons. Let me first give you the pros. Without question, the need for money tops the list. Admit it. It's not that easy to cope up with the high fees of college education these days. This is why some students who really want to study have no choice but to resort to entering part-time jobs in order to help their families financially. Next in line would be the good credentials students get when studying and working at the same time. Comments like good time management may be written down on their university records. These might be helpful when they actually work after college. Last would be the experience they could get from working in their preferred field. Now, time for the cons. We all know that students might lose their concentration in their academics due to having a part-time job. This is even worse if they have certain scholarships to maintain. But for me, this is the chance for them to go the extra mile. This could be the perfect time for them to practice effective time management skills to which they would be thankful for as they develop into mature individuals.
