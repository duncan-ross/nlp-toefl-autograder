I think banning the smoking at all restaurant is very ridiculous. When people are smoking other non-smokers are harmed. Because smoking causes smoke which contain bad elements. Besides it is very harmful when smoking at restaurants which are open place to all the people. In spite of this I have several reasons to against the policy(banning the smoking at all restaurants) First cigarette is item of personnel preference sold by government. So I think government has responsibility for keep the smokers rights. Government sell tobacco to get tax, so if they don't keep their rights, it's too selfish. So government should keep their rights and also they should make non-smokers to get of the damage of smoking. And connection between meal and desire of smoking is second reason. Most of smokers impulse to smoke when they finish their meal. If all the restaurants ban the smoking, smokers are smoking on the street, because in korea, there is no regulation to smoke on the street. If so, they will damage pedestrian. It means another damage. So I think it's reasonable to make smoking zone in restaurants, instead of banning the smoking at restaurants. As I am smoker, I often feel that restricts for the smokers are too serious, and the rights of smokers are somewhat neglected. To release protests among smokers, managing non-smoking zones properly is more important than expanding non-smoking zones without deep consideration.
