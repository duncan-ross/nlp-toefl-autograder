Nowadays, the question whether college students should have a part-time job or not has attracted many people's attention. Some people think students should have part-time jobs to train themselves for future. Others say that students should not have a part-time job because study is more important thing for students. I think there will be many advantages for student to do a part-time job. First of all, if students do part-time job, they can learn experience and get training. They can learn knowledge they cannot find from their books in the school. So in the future, when they try to find a job, they find they have more advantages than other students. Secondly, we can get money. Some of us are from poor families. We can pay tuition and buy something we want if we earn money by ourselves. It can release our parent's burden. In China, we all think that friends are very important. We can meet many people when we do part-time jobs. They can make friends with us and we can benefit from their knowledge and information. Of course, study is still the most important thing for us. We should take care of both study and part-time job. You cannot spend all the time in part-time job. If we make careful plan, it will be ok. All in all, I think there are more advantages doing a part-time job because we can get experience, more friends and money. If you can have time, try to do a part-time job.
