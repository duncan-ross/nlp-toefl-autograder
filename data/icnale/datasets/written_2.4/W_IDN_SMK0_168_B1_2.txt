Air pollution issue is becoming popular in the media. This kind of pollution has a very broad area that includes smoke from cigarettes, smog from motorized transportation, smog from factories, and even waste of burning garbage. One solution which has been applied in several developed country regarding the smoke from cigarette is not to let people smoking at all restaurants all over the country. This law may seem to deny the freedom of human rights if people have a narrow point of view. People who disagree with this law must think too much about themselves that they can not see other's rights. It is true that the decision to smoke or not is up to the individual himself, but I doubt that those who decide to smoke realise that their decision has annoyed other's health. People who smoke generally have already known about the risk of smoking and they take it as a consequence once they do it. They do have a choice whether they take that risk or not, but what about others? Do they have a choice to inhale the smoke which produced by those who smoke? When this law enforced fully in all over the country, the healthy people may stay healthy. They may have their right to choose.
