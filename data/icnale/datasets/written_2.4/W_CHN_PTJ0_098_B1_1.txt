Nowadays, college life is colorful. Besides studying, students participate in various kinds of activities and some of them have part time jobs. People have different perspective about if it is important for college students to have part time jobs. As far as I am concerned, part time job is just an additional part of college life, not a part of great importance. Part time job can make profit to students. For one thing, student can gain some social experience by means of contacting people outside the campus. For another, the payment can help students from rural family to pay the tuition fee. So it's definitely a beneficial part of college life. However, part time job maybe influence the studying especially when students overdo it. Some of my friends have a really tight schedule just because they have a part time job. Instead of relaxing themselves and do homework, they go to work when we go back to the dormitory. Their reason is that part time job is an important part of college life. I hold opposite opinion that students don't benefit much from part time jobs. There are a couple of reasons to name. Formerly, it will take the time otherwise you will use to study. Curriculum studying is always superior to other part of college life, for we students come to college with the major purpose of acquiring knowledge. Latterly, part time job is not the only way to gain social experience. Some activities can provide you with better opportunities. Generally speaking, when get a payment job; students usually get simple works which can make very limited profit for their future career. Lastly, it's important for people to relax after daily stressful studying, who can help students concentrate on school work better with profit to one's health.
