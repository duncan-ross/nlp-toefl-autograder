I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are all kinds of subject in college, like Languages, Science, Engineering, Education, Management, Humanities, Arts, Laws and Business. There are different skills in different majors. Nowadays, teenagers not only study in school but also have to try something in society. Because the society is reality, students cannot have diploma only. Even if they have a lot of knowledge and skills, they do not have chance to use the knowledge and skills on the society. It is a pity. However, to have a part-time job that makes students use their learning on it. Also, they can gain money of their own. For example, to gain for the tuition, the cost of living and other expenses, or they can save up. It is good for the teenagers to make a habit of saving money. To sum up, having a good experience is also an important thing to people to find a job in the future, especially college students. It is a good chance for college students to have a part-time job. Above all, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
