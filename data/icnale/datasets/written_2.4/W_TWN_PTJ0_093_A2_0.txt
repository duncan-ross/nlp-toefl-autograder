The answer is not the same to everyone. I think a part time job is very important for me, although it is hard to find a the part time job in my home town. It can help me earn my pocket money and let me learn some experience. So far, I have done over three different part time jobs. This summer vacation I work in a small foundation, the main job is help children finish their homework, desire games for them and play with them. The salary to other maybe to low, but I work very seriously. I seldom find a key in part time job, it need a person who key in carefully, if you don't careful enough, the boss will ask you check again, so I do the job always carefully and the boss will give me other case if he need me. Each part time job let me learn something maybe I couldn't learn in school, for example: how to interact with children and how to desire a game that all children like. Every time when I looking for a part time job, I ask myself to try different part time job. There is one thing very important for everyone do part time job should care about their manner.
