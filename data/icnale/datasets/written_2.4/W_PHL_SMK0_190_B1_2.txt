Being around smokers is, at least for me as a non-smoker and as someone aware of the consequences of cigarette smoking to one's health, not an experience I would like to have in my every day. Walking along the streets, it's something that can be quite bothersome. But more irritating even than that is the presence of those grey clouds of toxins in places where my eating is to take place. And I am in full-support of having smoking banned in all restaurants in the country. Restaurants, or any establishment where any form of eating is to take place, are one of the places where people are most susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, which according to studies is even more dangerous than smoking the cigarette itself. People sit down and, usually, take their time, and it is here that exposure to cigarette smoke is prolonged. Public health is endangered in this sense, and that should be enough reason to have smoking banned, at least in places where many people might be affected. I do, however, believe that more than banning smoking in such establishments is the promotion of public health awareness by making efforts to stop smoking altogether. Such will benefit not only the smoker – whose health will be taking a turn for the better – but the whole public.
