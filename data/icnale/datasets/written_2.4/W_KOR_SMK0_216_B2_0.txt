As most of the people know that smoking can harm people who are not smoking but just near the smoking person. They are called indirect smoker who can be affected by the real smoker. More serious fact is that when indirect smoker inhales some cigarette smoke from the real smoker who is just near to them they can be harmed by the smoke materials more than real smokers! It is very unfair to them. They can be just a victim without any kinds of mistake made by them. Therefore smoking must be banned in the all the restaurants. This is the only way that can prevent non-smoker from being affected by real smoker. However all the restaurants have to have a smoking room for the poor smoker who has to go out when they feel like smoking. This room must be rounded by all perfect walls that can keep from ant harmful materials to people in out there. And there, some rules also have to be made for safe. People who are getting out of the room should clean their hands and their outer that they wore in the smoking room must be taken off. This is the fair way both for the smoker and non-smoker.
