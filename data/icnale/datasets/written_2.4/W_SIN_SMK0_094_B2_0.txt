The long-term negative effects of smoking are widely known, so too are the doubly harmful effects of second hand smoke. On a purely practical level, I believe that a government should ban smoking at all restaurants simply because over time, this will demonstrate a significant reduction in a country's health care bill. Given that restaurants are public spaces where a significant portion of the population dines at on a regular basis, the propensity for cigarette smoke to adversely affect one's health is great. By cutting down on the number of people exposed to cigarette smoke at restaurants, a government also decreases the amount of smoking-related illnesses second hand smokers will fall prey to, and the amount of healthcare subsidies a government will have to shell out when these people seek treatment at public hospitals and clinics. Besides decreasing the healthcare bill of a country, decreasing the number of smokers also increases the productivity of the workforce by having less people succumb to chronic or terminal smoking-related illnesses and cancers. It also increases the life expectancy of the workforce, which results in more taxpaying citizens supporting the infants and the infirm. So, restaurants should be fully utilised in this quest to stamp out smoking. By banning smoking in restaurants, a government sends the message that smoking is not condoned in a social setting, which, over time, should encourage the population to exact social sanctions on those who flout this unwritten rule. This will have the overall impact of bringing smoking rates down even in other areas, and the country can enjoy the widespread benefits of a reduction in smoking rates.
