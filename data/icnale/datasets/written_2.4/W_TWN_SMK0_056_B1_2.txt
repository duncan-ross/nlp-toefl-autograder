Smoking problem has been argued for a long time since it not only hurts the person who smokes, but also who breathes the smoke. Although it is now legislated to limit smoking area, but most public places till allow smoking. I think it's necessary to ban smoking in all the restaurants. First, the most important thing to a restaurant is hygiene, but if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, it has to be doubted that there are some problems in hygiene. Second, the consumer pays to have a meal, the have the right to be provided a good environment. In my opinion, smoking will always not on the list of a restaurant. People here to eat a healthy meal, not pay for lung cancer. Third, restaurants are often full of kids. According to the law, children under 18 are not allowed to smoke. But as long as their parents take them to a dinner, they breathe in large amount of smoke! It is harmful for them. Last, smoking can do harm to our health. With strictly forbiddance of smoking areas can help decrease the number of smokers. Smoking is not easy to get rid of. However, those who don't smoke should not be sacrificed. A none-smoking meal should not become a far-reaching dream.
