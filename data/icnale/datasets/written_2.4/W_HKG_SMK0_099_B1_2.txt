Smoking is a life-threatening habit, don't you agree? If it really affects human life, what is the point of still allowing smoking in public places? In light of this, I absolutely agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First of all, a restaurant looks like a closed box. Smoking in such place would definitely cause side effects on health. This is because breathing in second-hand smoke would spark off coughing. More seriously, bronchitis and asthma may also result under prolonged exposure to such smoke. Since health is the most essential element to human, banning smoking at all restaurants can help people to stay away from devil. Secondly, smoking is detrimental to air pollution. In order to tackle this problem, prohibiting smoking at restaurants can eliminate one of the emission sources of smoke. Although it only helps little compared to tens of thousands of smokers all around the street, it at least can remedy the situation by reducing the places available for smokers to emit waste gas. Last but not least, people usually do not enjoy taking in second-hand smoke. Limiting smoking can make the atmosphere in restaurants better as the smelly gas would make the food taste worse psychologically. As a result, the reputation of the restaurant would be ruined. On the contrary, without such smoke, it becomes more enjoyable to eat inside the restaurant and can thus attract more customers. So it is really necessary to ban smoking at all restaurants. In view of above reasons, forbidding smoking would undoubtedly call for prompt action. In absence of smoke, health can be improved, pollution can be relieved and thus customers can enjoy their meals in the restaurants. Therefore, there is no doubt that completely disallowing people to smoke at restaurants is a correct practice.
