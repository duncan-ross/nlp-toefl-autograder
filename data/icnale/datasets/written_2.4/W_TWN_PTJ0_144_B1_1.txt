I agree that college students should experience more than one part-time jobs. While looking for a job, companies always care about if he or she had had working experiences. If one had never worked, he might not know about the difficulties in surviving in this society. He may think everything perfectly, but it is not exactly like that. Employers may think that if they employ the freshman who had had no experiences, he may be disappointed when he faces the difficulties or quit the job because he can not go through the problem. However, if he had had some experiences in working, he may know about the hard of works. In my opinion, a college student should have a part-time job for three reasons. First, it can increase his working experiences. Second, he does know how to distribute his time appropriately in working and study. Last but not the least, he figures out exactly the hard at earning money. So that he will not waste his money, even though he didn't earn money by himself but get the money from his parents. For the above three reasons, I think it would be better to have a part-time job since you are a student.
