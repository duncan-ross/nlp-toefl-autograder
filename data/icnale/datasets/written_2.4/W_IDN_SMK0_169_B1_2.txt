Many people have the habit of smoking cigarettes. They smoke at home, at the office, in public places like the station, the airport and also in the restaurants. They know smoking is a bad habit but they cannot stop it. They say they cannot think without smoking, they cannot work without smoking and they get a headache if they do not smoke. They do not care about others, people in their surroundings. Nowadays, there are many restaurants which allow their customers to smoke. It is because, the owners want to get as many customers as possible to gain the profit. However, not a few restaurants went bankrupt because of smokers. That is why there are two reason why smoking should be banned in restaurant. First of all, smoking harms people's health. Not only the smokers who will get the disadvantages, but also the people who is near the smoker. Their smoke can cause more harm to the non-smokers rather than the smokers themselves. The smoke can cause heart disease, and many other diseases. Secondly, smoking causes air polution. There will be very little oxygen in that area, and it will make that room inconvinient. Those are the reason why smoking should be banned in restaurant.
