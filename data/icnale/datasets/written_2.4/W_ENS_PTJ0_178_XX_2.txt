I agree because I think that it is very important for students to get on the job training as soon as they can. This would at least give them more of a competitive edge in the marketplace. The workplace is much tougher now especially in the current financial climate. Therefore, students need to get as much experience as they can and accumulate as many skills as they can within as short a space of time that they can because a few years can pass very quickly. They have got to get some basic planning and organizational skills just to keep the job and study without sliding backwards. Employers will most certainly take into account their academic achievements but they will always look for experience as well. Students need to be able to learn on the job and learn quickly these days and by having some prior experience, it will increase their advantage slightly. Naturally, the extra money can provide another incentive to do a good job and may serve to help keep them motivated if they find themselves in a slump sometimes. Another advantage is that they will be exposed, in some small way, to the pressures of working at a real job which will better prepare them to face full-time employment.
