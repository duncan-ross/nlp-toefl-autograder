I do not think that is fair to ban smoking in restaurants because there are just as many people who would like to smoke as people who do not want to smoke. Of course everyone does know that smoking is bad for your health, but many people weigh the risks and choose to smoke any waves. We are adults and have the right to make decisions for ourselves, and no one should be allowed to par rules on what we can and can't do when it comes to our own bodies. Like many other smokers, I do not want to smoke forever, but for now, I think it is fine and I don't see any reason that I should be prevented from smoking in restaurants after I have a bite to eat. It is very satisfying to have a smoke after a meal, just as a satisfying to have some dessert or a cup of coffee after a meal. One last reason is that smoking is a great way to meet new people. I have met countless people who have asked me for a light or have asked me to bum a smoke, and you can meet some very interesting people if you have cigarettes with you.
