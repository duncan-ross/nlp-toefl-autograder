College life is a very critical period of life in the life of a student. Because the studies becomes somewhat more hard with the start of college life. The routine of students becomes tough due to the burden of studies, because the syllabus increases as well as becomes tough. So, studies need a lot of time. Therefore at this stage part time jobs are not essential for students. But the students which have to face financial crises should support their parents, if they have abilities and they can manage. But if the students could not manage they think that they are not doing their best in the studies. They should not do part time jobs. Because the only thing that parents demand is the best performance of their child in studies. So, we should prefer studies more than anything. The extraordinary students, if they can manage should help their parent in the financial matters. But if they think that their studies are being effected, they do not do this. Whole of the future of the student is based on his performance in studies. There are a lot of reasons due to which students do the part time job i-e for the support of their parents. Some people do part time jobs to keep themselves busy independent. inshort the matter of doing part time jobs depend upon the abilities of student.
