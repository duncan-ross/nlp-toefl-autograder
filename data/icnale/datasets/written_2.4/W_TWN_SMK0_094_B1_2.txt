Smoking has long been regarded as a health killer which not only multiplies the risk of getting lung cancer, but contains ingredients that influence our daily health. Some people may argue that, even if smoking is harmful to health, it should be a person's basic right to choose to/not to smoke, just like he/she may choose to/not to have a pack of junk food. The claim may seem strong; however, the real problem of smoking is, according to researches, that the emissions produced during the cigarette's burning also harm, if not even more seriously, the health of people around the smoker. Since it might invade other individuals' right and safety, smoking becomes a public issue rather than as simple as having a chocolate milkshake or potato chips while watching TV, which may raise up only the eater's own fat in blood. Aware of the threat of public health and the following massive medical cost, the government and education have endeavored to fight against smoking. Unfortunately, they have never success on knocking it down; even worse, the number of smokers grows time by time. This failure may be because of the magnetic appeals reinforced by the promotions of the cigarette companies and the images presented through the mass media, especially in movies. The handsome, strong cowboys and charming, respected movie stars are all whispering in the consumers' ears: "smoking is harmless; moreover, it makes you become ME. " Apparently, the allurement of becoming "dreamy" in the advertisements and videos is much stronger than the warning pictures on the cigarette packs. Thus, if hoping to cast smoking away, perhaps the government should better first knock the "cool" smoking figures down.
