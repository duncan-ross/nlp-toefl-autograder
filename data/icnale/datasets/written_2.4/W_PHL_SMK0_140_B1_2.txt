Some things that people do because of this belief are drinking liquor, gambling, smoking cigarettes and many more. Though we know most of this affect our health, we do not stop ourselves from doing it. Some businesses take advantage of this and would tolerate such actions. For example, the people who likes to smoke cigarettes. Restaurants have two areas for their customers and they are the smoking area and the non smoking area. This is one way for them to draw more customers. Knowing that the number of people who smoke are increasing they use it as a tool to gain more customers. Instead of helping others to stop smoking and remind them the negative effect it has. That is why, there are times that we ourselves should realize these things by our own. Though it may draw customers, it could affect the health of other customers and the staff as well aside from themselves. In the end of the day, the question we should ask ourselves is, would we be able to face the consequences that follows ? Such as the guilt that would drown us through out our life. The fact that we could've avoided this outcome, if we had just stop and had not let fear defeated us. And most of all, the fact that it is already too late to change now and repent.
