While writing this essay I am in a fix whether to favor it or to disfavor it. Because I have been experiencing this in my all student life. Bitter or sweeter I will share my own thoughts on this very topic. Basically every student has to go in practical life ultimately. So part time job or practical experience grant the student with enough confident about how to tackle life practically. When he is aware that how much struggle is put forwarded to finance the studies, he becomes thrifty and pay more attention to his studies. Financial aide and student loans help cover some of the costs, a vast majority of college students are taking on part-time jobs to help offset the costs of university life. With the cost of education on the rise, more students are feeling the need to try to achieve some sort of financial independence. Although a part-time job can be discouraging at times, the experience of work can more than make up for it. The very basic and the most important quality that even a lay man needs at every step of life, is the management. It may be the management of his daily chores, duties and rights, may starts from cradle and ends with grave. A student managing studies and part time job, is learning and practicing the proper management effectively and efficiently, within limited time and resources if he is performing excellent performance in studies and job as well, he is the master of life's management. At this very age when he needs proper time for sports, enjoyment, how you can expect that he will do all this. In conclusion I would say that a student should study properly, and if he can manage he should go for part time job, because, anyways, practical experience has no alternative at all.
