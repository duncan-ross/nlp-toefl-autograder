I agree with the suggestion that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is so bad a habit that it harms not only smokers themselves, but also people who are close to them. So besides restaurants, all other public places should also ban smoking. Smoking does a lot of harm to people. As we all know, cigarettes have many poisonous chemicals that are harmful for our lungs. Scientists have had an experiment that found smokers' lungs are worse than people who don't smoke, and smokers live much shorter. Besides, the gas cigarettes release is more harmful which have a bad influence on the environment around smokers. Besides, smoking can cause fire accident. when people have smoked a cigarette they may put it anywhere without care of papers or dry leaves nearby which can cause fire accident. Although the possibility is small, the great number times will make it big. Also, smoking has a bad influence on teenagers. In many films and TV shows, smoking is always related with violence which make teenagers think that smoking means strength. In this way, many depressed boys and girls begin smoking and that make them more fallen than ever. So, in my opinion, smoking is such a bad habit that we must ban it as soon as possible. We should hold a clear brain at any time that smoking can do nothing but damage to us. When we feel unhappy, keep away from cigarettes and do something more interesting such as sports. Let's keep this in mind: cherish families and refuse smoking.
