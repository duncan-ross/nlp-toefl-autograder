About this topic, I think that it is not very important for college students to do part-time job. As we know, more college students tend to do a part-time job. Someone even has two or three. Though every coin has two sides, I believe that disadvantages of doing a part-time job outweigh its advantages. Some people guess that doing a part-time job can acquire many benefits, such as income, living experiments, etc. However, it pays us a large quantity of time and energy for the jobs. Doing jobs must be tired; it is not good for our health. In addition, colleges are the place where we learn knowledge. People usually believe that studying is the main task to students but not earning money. I really agree with it. Last but not least, doing part-time job can not earn a large number of money. Nevertheless, it cannot deny that we may be succeeding with lots of income in the future. Thus, knowledge plays an important role in our life. From what has been mentioned above, we can easily come to the conclusion that do part-time job is not a good choice to college students. We should focus more on study now.
