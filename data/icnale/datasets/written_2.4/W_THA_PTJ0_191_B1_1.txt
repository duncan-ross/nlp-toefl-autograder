I never have a part time job before, because I never think it about it. I think part time job is the another way to support family. I think it's very useful to help everyone in your family. If I was in Mathayom 2 or 3 and having a part time job, it'll make me crazy about it. However, if my son or daughters want to have a part time job, I'll agree with them. Sometime, I saw my old friend studying and having a part time job as a stunt man, the day that I know about this, it makes me feel surprise. Not only me but all of my classmate is suffering about it and he make it secretly. So that if I can do a part time job right now, I'll do it. Conversely my GPA is too low, so I have to think it first before I have it. So that I have to fix my time first before I've a part time job. Despite, my real life, it isn't have a good way to come here, my life is too bored and I've to stay with my grandma. And she has a special way to talk with me to don't having a part time job.
