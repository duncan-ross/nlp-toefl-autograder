But because there are many hidden benefits to having a part-time job, I think that many students stand to benefit by having one. For example, I work at the rec center, and as a result I spend a lot of time thinking about health and fitness and how to become stronger, faster, and more fit. Most of my coworkers are the same way, and most of us have a very high level of fitness. This is the hidden benefit that I was talking about. Not only do we have a good job at a fun place on campus, we can learn about how to be healthy and we can have a place where we can do all the things we need to do to stay fit. In the same way, there are different in benefits to different part-time jobs. For example, if you work at a pizza restaurant, you can learn how to make pizza and you can also eat as much as you want to, although that might be bad for you. Every part time job has a hidden benefit that you can take advantage of if you only take the small effort to think about all the things you are doing and how you can work on those things to benefit yourself as well.
