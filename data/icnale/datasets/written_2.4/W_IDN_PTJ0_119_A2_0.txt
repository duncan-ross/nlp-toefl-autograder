The part-time job is an activity that is only filled to the people who have free time, because the job it takes a bit of a half-day rather than a real job that requires quite a lot that is almost a full day. Example of part-time job is such as private teacher, waitress, shopkeeper, cleaning service, etc. I disagree about it, I think it is not important, because of it will make our time wasted learning. We became a student to seek knowledge and learn our chosen field of study. What we look for part-time job? We know it can ease the burden on both our parents, but our task here just to learn and seek knowledge, so that we can achieve goals that we want, and make both our parents are proud of our success as a student. Our parents pay us for college, for our bright and useful in our future. His time we have not replied to their services with money, but we responded with the knowledge that we can as long as we seek knowledge at the university. If we had a student who successfully then we work for money, and gives it to our parents, I think so.
