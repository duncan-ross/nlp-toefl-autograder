While smoking brings about certain temporal pleasure to the body, there is no doubt denying that it brings about many harmful effects not only to the smoker's body, but also to the people around the smoker, in the form of second hand smoke. Smoking damages various crucial organs that are required for the proper functioning of the body. This would result in a host of illnesses and side effects such as cancers and the colouring of body parts like the teeth and fingernails. Hence, smoking is classified as a negative externality since the individual's consumption of cigarettes results in greater imposition of negative costs on the society itself. Thus, society is worse off with the presence of cigarettes and smokers respectively and adequate measures are required to reduce the negative effects of smoking on society. Banning smoking at all restaurants is a strict and harsh legislation, albeit the effectiveness of this measure would be thoroughly questioned and examined. In the context of a developing country like Indonesia, although most restaurants are indoors and air conditioned, costumers are still seen smoking indoors since a particular portion of the restaurant is dedicated to smokers. This is bad as non-smoking costumers who patronise the restaurant would have to endure and put up with the second hand smoke while dining. Hence, by imposing such a strict banning on smoking on all restaurants countrywide, I think it would be quite effective to curb the problem of people smoking indoors and thus, the negative effects of breathing in second hand smoke by the non-smokers would significantly be reduced.
