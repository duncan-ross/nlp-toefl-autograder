I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country and there is one main reason for this which is smoking in the restaurants might affect other non smoking customers in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place where people come to enjoy their meal and as a non-smoker myself one of the worst way of having food is inhaling other person's cigarette smoke with my dish. It is widely known that second- hand smoke is much dangerous for a person's health than actually smoking the cigar itself. This is one of the biggest problem and why I believe smoking should be banned in all places. Non-smokers are hearting their health because of the smokers. Some people might say that banning smoking is against rights of smokers and that they have the right to smoke where ever and whenever they want. However, what about the non-smoker's right? I believe smoker's right should be protected only in a circumstance where non-smoker's right is not abused. If smokers can smoke by not effecting non-smokers 100% then it should not be restricted. However, in a place like restaurant where space is blocked this is most likely to be impossible therefore, I believe smoking should be banned in all the restaurant throughout the country.
