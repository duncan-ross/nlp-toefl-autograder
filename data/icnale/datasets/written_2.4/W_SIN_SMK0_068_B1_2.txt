Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants but partially banned. Banning smoking at restaurants is advisable as passive smokers will not be affected. These passive smokers suffer the same ill effects of smoking as those who themselves smoke. In addition, this ensures that no cigarette particles will drop into the food. Cleaners also have less work in cleaning up cigarette buds of inconsiderate smokers who litter. With a smoking ban, children will not learn from these smokers and hopefully be a form of prevention to smoking in more people. However, a complete ban may have an impact on the earnings of these restaurants, especially those who operate late in the night. Smokers, although a small percentage of the population, do bring business to restaurants. These smokers have the freedom to smoke as and when they like while eating out and a complete ban will deter them from patronising these restaurants. Restaurants which open late into night often attract smokers who stay out late to drink and chat with friends. A complete ban of smoking will have a large enough effect on the income of these restaurants. While a ban of smoking at restaurants is welcome, a complete ban will affect the income of the restaurant. Hence, cordoning off a portion of the restaurant specially for smokers is encouraged.
