I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Personally, I really hate somebody to smoke. Smoking is not only one person's business but all the people's around you. Second-hand cigarette is more harmful than the original. In public, there are so many people are absorbed in the harmful gas when you smoking, especially in the restaurant, when all the people enjoy their meals, on what ground you can smoke?I always see such a thing when I have my meals at a restaurant, some people like to smoking when they have meals or after they eat up. That's really upset me! But sadly, I have got used to it. It is impossible that they will stop such kind of thing. Because restaurant is a place that all kinds of people can get in, especially some people who have smoked for many years, it is hard to tell them that they cannot smoke when they have meals. So we should have some law to limit them. In a word, I still think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants over the country, no matter what kind of people should care about others' opinion.
