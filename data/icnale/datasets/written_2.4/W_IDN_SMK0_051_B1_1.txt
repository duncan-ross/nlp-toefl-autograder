I agree if government ban smoking in restaurant because smoking not only harms the smoker but also those around him or her. They should not be allowed to smoke around other people in public. Smoking in public places especially restaurant cause a considerable amount of harm to people and the government should be doing more to protect its citizens. There are some reasons why government should ban smoking in restaurant? One of them is because smoking give some disadvantages whether for active smokier or passive smoker. Cigarettes are full of many harmful substances and if many people know what they were they were inhaling they would probably quit immediately. Cigarette contains thousands of chemicals which can cause lung cancer, heart disease, bronchitis. However, if you ask smoker why do you smoke? What will you get by smoking a cigarette? they will tell you lots of benefits of smoking. The smokers thin that by smoking they can feel relax and reduce stress. However, there is a fact that we must know. Cigarettes are made using tobacco. Tobacco contains of nicotine which is very harmful drug for health. How pity they are, passive smokers who can suffer health problems if they spend long periods of time among who smoke. Government should ban smoking in restaurant because it can hurt other people. Sometimes people throw their cigarette every where. They don't care it can burn things in the restaurant. The world will be clean and comfortable if all of people do not smoke everywhere.
