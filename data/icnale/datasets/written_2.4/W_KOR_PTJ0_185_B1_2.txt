Maybe part time job is not familial with Korea students. I also so. However I think that part time job is a good experience. When I was a high school student 3 grade, I was doing a part time job. Then I met many people and I feel not good. Because guest is not good, work is very hard and it made me very tired. I did not know that time is priceless experience. But I know now that after I graduates college, and I enter society "world" it will be an experience. Therefore I think like this. And doing part time job is realizing money' importance. I do not know exactly because of part time job' experience. Spending money, I think one more time. My personality will be one cause but I think part time job experience. Doing like this is a good deed. So part time job is worthy of experiencing. I was freshman and young yet. So I and did not experience many time. But If I have a time I want to do part time job. I think this experience is good. My parents might say that study hard in that time. Because they want to concentrate study.
