Have a part time job is important for college students for some reasons. First, students will get experiences of their job. They are in the new environment. It is make them know about how serve someone, how know new environment beside us, and what must we do. Experiences make someone mature. Second, student can realize their knowledge. As a teacher we will transfer our knowledge from us, as a teacher to our students. Student will get new knowledge and we will get some experiences and satisfied from teaching. Third, as we know if we work, sure we will get payment. Although this money not enough to pay our registration in campus, but it became us satisfied if we can get money from our effort. Fourth, student s will help devide their parents. We are students, the consequence is we must pay and study. We do not get job now and do not can pay our registration yet. So if we get part time job we can help them. And the last, try to part between job and study. The obligation of student is study, and as a human that have productive age, it is better for us to have job. We can decide when we must study and when we must work. So, it makes us discipline human.
