I agree and would like to know if and when this is going to happen? Because I would like to be around to see it. This has been coming for a long time actually and there have been many discussions already. I think that it would be in Japan's best interests to keep up with what is happening in the world in this regard. Japan could easily introduce bans on smoking in restaurants and it has got to be in the best interests of the Japanese people for the future. Since the publicity many bans have received has been fairly positive in most cases, I don't feel that this is an area that Japan should be concerned about. Even if the bans were receiving adverse publicity I believe that Japan should go ahead with the bans and simply have a public display of all the medical evidence related to smoking and the many deaths that it causes for all the naysayers to see. In this way, it would be highly unlikely that they could attempt to make a strong argument opposing the bans and would have to try another tac. All in all though I feel that the Japanese Government may be surprised at the amount of support that they will receive for introducing the bans.
