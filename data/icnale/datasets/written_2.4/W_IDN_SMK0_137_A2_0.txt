Smoking is a habit that is very common and widespread in the community. Dangers of smoking to health have been studied and proved by many people. Adverse effects of smoking was already known for certain. Many studies have shown cigarette smoking increase the risk of various diseases such as heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, impotence, pregnancy disorders and defects in the fetus. Even hazardous materials and toxins in cigarettes not only causes health problems in people who smoke, but also to the people around him who do not smoke, who are mostly infants, children and mothers who are forced to be passive smokers because adjacent to active smokers. Whereas passive smokers have a higher risk for lung cancer and heart disease I think the ban on smoking in restaurants is very important. Because many people also support a smoke free movement. Want to smoke may smoke from a special place for smoking and where smoking is not close to the entrance of the restaurant. So that no air circulation smokers who may enter. The important thing is physically separate from the main building and away from the entrance. If we find smoker in restaurants give the restaurants manager a sanctions not the smokers. We will do a reprimand, if not imprevious we will announce in the media, if not working we also give the temporary suspension of business activities, and if there is not also suspectible license revocation. I think my idea could work 9, 99 percent if my idea received support from the managers of restaurants and people who want to be free from cigarette smoker.
