I agree with the statement. There are three reasons that I agree with it. First, college school students need money to do something. For example, some students want to go abroad during summer vacation to study English, it costs a lot of money. If some students need to buy a book to study their specialty, they need to money. That is why they need money in a lot of cases. Second, part-time job is one of way to know society. I think that most of college students hardly know about society. Because they have been alive in school and have not done part-time job. Of course I had not done it until I became college student. I have known how hard to get money since I became part-time job. I work at soup shop now. I have not wondered the difficulty of the rules in the shop until I started working here. I think that if I did not do part-time job, I could not do these experiences. So students should know society before they get a job. Third, college students are independent from their parents. In Japan, college and high school are not obligation. So college and high school students should earn money theirselves. But many high school ban to do part-time job. Students cannot do it. So high school students do not have to do it. But I have not heard a college which ban to do part-time job. So they have to work to earn their money. That is why I agree with the statement.
