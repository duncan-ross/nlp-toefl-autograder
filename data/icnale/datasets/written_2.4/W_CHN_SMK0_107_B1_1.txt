Many people are smoking in the restaurants. We all know the harm of smoking. So, I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. I have this opinion because of the following reasons. Smoking is not polite in public place. If you want to smoke, it is your choice. But people around you can smell the smoke. Consequently, smoking in the restaurants will do harm to other people. I can think no better illustration of the idea than the example of my roommate. For instance, my roommate Sun who is used to smoking fought with other people in the restaurant because other people thought the smell is disgusting. I have another argument for my point. Have you thought about the question: how could you eat the food when you smoke? In other words, you can hardly enjoy your food. Actually, the situation is not rare, it is just one of many examples I have encountered. For example, my roommate is Liang. He often smokes when he have meal. Therefore, he is noticeably thin and apparently not healthy. Because of the above reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
