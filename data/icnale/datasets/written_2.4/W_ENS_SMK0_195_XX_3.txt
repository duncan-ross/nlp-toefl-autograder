Whether are not smoking should be allowed in Japanese restaurants would appear to be a choice that is completely up to the Japanese citizens. I don't have much advice to offer them on the pros or cons of such a legislation because I do not understand their culture. Despite this, there are many reasons why discouraging smoking especially in restaurants makes sense given the patronage of other clients and especially small children. It is well known that secondhand smoke is much more dangerous than first hand smoke, and the worst thing is that secondhand smokers do not have any choice in whether they will smoke or not. The selfishness and self centeredness of many smokers seems to be unrealized by the smokers themselves, and they do not seem to understand that what to them as an enjoyable experience or even a hard to break habit can have serious health consequences for people they don't even know. If they smoke around their families, then they are effectively harming the people that matter to them most, and it is beyond me why they would continue to do so if they really love their families. For these two reasons, banning smoking in restaurants in Japan may be a good move for the Japanese populace as a whole.
