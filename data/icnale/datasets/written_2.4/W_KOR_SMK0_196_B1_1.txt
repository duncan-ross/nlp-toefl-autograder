I agree that smoking in the public places should be banned. I think that the smokers' right should be partially restricted under the consideration of public health and other social benefits. Freedom of smokers, the doctor is important, but much more to defend people's freedom is assumed. Because smoking is harming people's health. The severity of smoking is passive smoking. The dangers of secondhand smoke have been already scientifically proven. This also affects the damage to children. If children when adults are greater than the damage. It was a kid, the more serious if it is young. Thus, smoking in public places raises a lot of damage. If possible, advice to quit smoking, smoking in public places should be banned 100%. Cigarette price hike is not an effective way. This is a real smokers do not give the effect of smoking. Smoking in public places is not good for his support. One example is a serious smoking in University buildings. Came out already in the school newspaper column. Students who smoke less, there are many students who do not smoke. Therefore, for the happiness of a number of smokers, you should not smoke in the building. Thus, from the public spaces around us will have to run non-smoking.
