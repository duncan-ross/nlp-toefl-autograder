In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time and the reasons are as follows.  First, I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. The second reason is that having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help teenagers find their ideal job more easily in the future. And the teenagers can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance. Third, teenagers can also expand their interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people t o help us, they will try their best to help us.
