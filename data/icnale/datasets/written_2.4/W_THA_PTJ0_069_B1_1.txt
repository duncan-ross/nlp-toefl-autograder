Today, many things in this world are expensive. People need a lot of money for pay in daily life and including college student. In university the student need the money to pay such as food, cloth, book etc. so the part-time job is a good choice for the college student. I think the part-time job have important and not important for college student. First the part-time job is important for the college student because they need the money to pay in daily life. If they have a part-time job they can make the money buy themselves to help the parent decrease the cost. They can learn the new thing and new experience from the part- time job for example meet new people, not wasting the time in bad way, know the method to live in the future and also they will know the value of the money that they make. Sometimes the part-time job is not important for the college student because if they work hard they don't have the time enough to study and impact to health because they don't have the time to take a rest. Finally t college students he part-time job has advantage and disadvantage. In advantage they can receive many good things and disadvantage is they don't have time enough to study.
