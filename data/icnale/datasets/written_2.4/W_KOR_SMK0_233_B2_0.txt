I agree that smoking should be completely prohibited in all restaurant. There are two reasons why smoking-ban is needed. First, Smokers should not damage non-smokers' health. Since restaurants are public places, many kinds of people go there, including heavy-smokers and totally non-smokers. However, because most restaurants have not yet spared exclusive smoking area, so that smokers and non-smokers should be in same places. In this case, non-smokers are prior to smokers' right to smoke. The number of non-smokers is far bigger than the number of smokers. In addition, every people are born to be non-smoker, non-smoking state is more natural. Therefore, since its hard to make separate spaces for smokers, people who like smoking should persevere the inconvenience. Secondly, all restaurants should be freed by smoking, because ultimately, smokers should quit smoking habits. It is well-known that smoking really hurts people's health. In addition there are many researches that smoking is the worst thing people enjoys as their taste. Tobacco is famous for its notorious addictness and even it is hard to enumerate the bad aspects of smoking. Despite of all these things, if smoking is admitted in restaurants around the country, it is the action which totally ignores public health. In addition, if young people see already-smokers' actions, that can lead youth to do the same thing. Inhibiting smoking in public area including restaurants will work well to decrease the country's smoking rate. To sum up, for the two reasons above, smoking ban in restaurants is very important. By free people from smoking air, public places will be better, and also it will improve public health. Therefore banning smoking in restaurants should be executed as soon as possible.
