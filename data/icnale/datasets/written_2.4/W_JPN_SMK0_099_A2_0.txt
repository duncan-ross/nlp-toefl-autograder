I disagree. First, I think that smoking has to be banned everywhere in the world, including at restaurants, of course. Smoking harms not only one's health who is smoking but also people's health around the person. There is Japanese saying that, Smoking has a lot of bad things but doesn't have even one thing. Second, smoke makes people feel bad. I have been to Chinese restaurant which doesn't ban smoking. At the restaurant many people are smoking and smoke makes the taste of food bad. What made the matter worse; the smell of smoke attached my favorite clothes. So, I never want to go the restaurant. There are many restaurants which separate smoking area and non-smoking area. But separating is not enough, they should ban smoking completely. Third, if restaurants ban smoking, they will be able to earn more money. The number of people who don't smoke is much more than that of people who smoke, and due to raise of tax of tobaccos, the number of people who don't smoke is likely to decrease. So, if restaurants ban smoking, more people who don't like smoke like me will go to the restaurants. After all, to ban smoking is good for both customers and restaurants.
