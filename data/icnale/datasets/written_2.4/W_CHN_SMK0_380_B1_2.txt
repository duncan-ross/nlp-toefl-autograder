 When it comes to banning smoking at all the restaurants, the opinions vary from person to person. Some argue that it is a good way to improve air quality in the restaurants while some consider it is bad to set the limit to smokers' rights of freedom. However, I adhere to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There are a couple of reasons for it. For one thing, the effects of second-hand smoking is also terribly harmful to healthy. When smokers begin smoking, poisonous gases from cigarettes are inevitably left and stay in the restaurants though the air-conditioners are on. People have to passively take in the gases when they breathe. When people stay in this environment for long time, their health will decline because the substances in the gases is prone to cause many diseases. So the effects of second-hand smoking is the same as directly smoking. For another thing, smoking in the restaurants, to some extent, affects the volume of customers and worsen the business. People tend to choose a neat and clean place to enjoy their meals in order to relieve from hectic work. For this reason, people are likely to avoid choosing in the restaurants where smokers are polluting the indoor air. Hence, those restaurants may meet some difficulties. According to the reasons, I am of the opinion that it is better to completely forbid smoking at all the restaurants. Moreover, it will promote smokers to give up smoking and let smokers more clearly know the harm of smoking.
