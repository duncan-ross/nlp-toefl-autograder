I agree with a statement that students should have a part time job while being in university or collage. It was working for extra income and to recognize the benefits of free time, and alleviate the burden on parents. However, work should be aware of their time from learning to work. If you do not know the correct time, work may affect the learning. Money from a short time may not be worth to take that risk. The students should be very careful and be very punctual. If they wish to do both, they have to be on time in classes or even finishing homework or projects. By the way, if they want to study only, they should not waste their time by watching T. V or having party with friends. I am not going to say that having party or have fun with friends are not good, but it should be in appropriate time. I agree with the statement but just want to give a caution to any students who want to have a part time job to keep manage their time table appropriately. I am sure that If they can manage time, they can be successful both studying and working.
