Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Nowadays, the rate of people who have been smoking is increasing up in every year, and it seems not going down soon. Smoking can make a cancer if you smoke for a long time, and also can annoy people around you, especially in a small place like the restaurant. This place should be completely banned because if other people who are not smoking it will feel smelly and stinky, and a food taste can be lost by smokes. Smoking in restaurant will make a place does not look like where people can have a lunch or dinner. Think about when you are at a restaurant and eating delicious foods, but suddenly a smoker who sits by your table is smoking impolitely, you might feel want to walk out from that restaurant immediately. Moreover, if someone who is very hungry, and there are only 2 restaurant which he can choose I'm sure that he will not choose a restaurant that full of smokers. On the other hands, if a restaurant would like to keep customers who are a smoker, then they have to make ventilator for them, so non-smoker can feel comfortable with it. In conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned in restaurant, but if it is necessary, then making a smoking-area can help it out because in present the rate of smoking is going up. However, if it is possible we should not allow smoking at all.
