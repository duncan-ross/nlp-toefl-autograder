Everybody must know the smoking it very not good. But why the people in this world like to smoke. In Thailand it's the same, the most people like to smoke and it's not easy to stop. Some people don't know smoking it's very bad for many things. First, I think it's not good for your health. Your health must be very important in your life. If your health or your body have any problem, I think it's a very bad news in your life. It's same some body in your family death and you must very sad about this news. So another thing that happens to you is your nails and toe nails will turn yellow. Now you may know that your finger nails turn yellow because of the cigarette being near them, but what you probably don t know is that your toe nails turn yellow because not all of the tobacco gets out of your nose and your mouth. But not all of it comes out so it gets inside you and gets out through your toe nails. We must try to take care the body for make it healthy every time. If everybody who smoke can stop smoking, it can help the people who never smoke too. It's mean if people get some smoke for who smoking the cigarette, they can be a sick very easy. If they not smoke in the place where many people (the restaurant, the park, the department store) it's can help many people.
