Student life is full of excitement and thrill. Some students give full time to their studies to get good marks. Parents of some student can afford all of the expenses of college while others can't. Students who are keen to get food result despite of their poverty are faced to do part time jobs to fulfill their college expenses. The effort is good but causes bad effect on their studies. They could not focus on their studies. For instance a student goes to college daily and after wards it works at a workshop or at a store etc. till afternoon. A human and especially a teen ager become fatigue after all these activities so how could he pay full time and full energy to his studies with open mind. After this clarification it is proved that part time jobs for students are not recommendable. This also affects their result for which they are doing all this. This is the responsibility of the Government and authorities that they should take necessary steps to overcome this situation. Such students whose parents can't bear the burnet of their studies should be awarded scholarships to buy up their aims. They should be back up to pay full attention on their studies leaving behind other actives of life in college. They should be making carefree from these college expenses so that they pay full attention to their studies. Students doing part time jobs are also cock in health. Government should realize that we can't destroy our future by losing the talent of our country.
