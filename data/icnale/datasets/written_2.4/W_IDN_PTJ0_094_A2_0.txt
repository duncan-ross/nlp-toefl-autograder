Every student in addition to learning will also need to continue to develop themselves. One method of self development is the handle links by working part time. Working part time to make students become know how hard making money so they can be motivated in learning. In addition, by working part time, students also know how things should be prepared later when after graduating college. So later on when they graduated from college, they can open a work based on the experience of working part-time they had ever experienced. Another benefit of working part-time are students parents can help the economy because students can get the money themselves, so no need to ask for money to parents, in addition to other benefits is to increase contacts and business relationships with new people who have more knowledge and from our experience that makes us rich in experience in the future. Based on my experience today, part-time work that many are run by current students is to become a tutor, online business, and opened his own small business. Many of the students who became a tutor for students in elementary, junior high and high school who could make money on average $ 5 - 10 only by teaching their students for 1. 5 hours. If the students good at marketing and surf normally they will open an online business whether it be through social networking, forums, or the other. As for the clever marketing but they are less able to surf normally open merchandise only.
