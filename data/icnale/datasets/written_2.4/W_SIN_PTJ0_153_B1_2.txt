I agree to a certain extent that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I believe that it is an invaluable experience to have a part time job as it provides good exposure to the student. Being able to earn one's keep allows one to understand the true value of money. Furthermore, students will learn to be independent. In addition, being a student means having the flexibility to experiment with different jobs and to have fun while working. Thus, I believe that it is good for students to have a part-time job before they start working, i. e. graduate. However, a student's primary objective is to study and studies should be prioritized over all else. Having a part time job might affect one's studies should the commitment be too heavy. This distraction could pose negative consequences on one's results if his or her schedule is not properly managed as not all people possess good time management skills. Hence, I argue that college students should have a part time job only during the holidays when they do not have deadlines, projects or exams to study for. If even the holidays are filled with commitments, then perhaps they should wait till these commitments are over.
