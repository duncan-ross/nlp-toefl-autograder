I do think that for many college students, part-time work is a valuable investment of their time, but I also know from personal experience that this can place many stresses that are really necessary upon you. For example, when I was a freshman in college, before I began my master's program, I found a first time job at a local restaurant. At first, it was great to make money, and is great to have something to do. But as time went on, I became busier and busier with school, and I was not able to devote to it the attention which I feel it deserved. Consequently, my grades suffered for one or two semesters, and it has been very difficult to get my GPA back up to where it is now. At the end of the day, a student's most important directive is to go to school. Hopefully, other students have a better experience with part-time work, and they found something which they could incorporate well into their class schedules and could also have fun doing. I think that I may need to find part-time work again soon, because my funds are running low, and I hope that this time I will have a better experience thus time too.
