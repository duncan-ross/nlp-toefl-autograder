Every student should take interest in studies. Youth is responsible for the future of any country. They must be educated properly. Education means to learn something. Education gives us information and litealy. It boards our vision. Prosperity of any country depend on how many nation of that country have jobs? Do any work properly and honesty? Do they give attention to their duties? But education and work are two opposite things. The students which give full time to their studies cannot do job. And the students which give their full concentration to the jobs cannot study properly. So, the students which learns anything cannot take part in prosperity of their country. And those who do jobs cannot uproot the illiteracy. So, it is impossible to do jobs who study in any institution. But if we take example of England, we should vision that students do jobs also. But to prove this there should be proper check and balance. It means every should give proper time to their studies and jobs. So, in this way they can uproot illiteracy and can take part in prosperity of country. But the actual and main thing is proper check and balance in both things.
