Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 225 I strongly agree with it. I am a social smoker. So I can understand both sides but I think Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The day before yesterday I went to pub. The place is allowed to smoke. Some people smoke and some people don't smoke but they mingle all together in it. When I was there I felt quit uncomfortable and irritated because of smoking. Even though I am a social smoker I cannot stand with smoke because the place is difficult to be airy. So the smoke cannot come and go easily that is the biggest reason why we should ban smoke at all the restaurants. The other reason is we should think about nonsmokers. People do not smoke because it is bad for health and that is not suitable for them physically or whatever. So they do not smoke. When we smoke, people breathe and the smoke goes into their body and it is a major cause of cancer. In fact, second hand smokers can have more cancer than smokers. The rate of having cancer is higher than smokers. Nonsmokers are naturally open to get a cancer without their will. That is unfair. Smokers should care about nonsmokers because we are live together.
