I agree with this sentence because in the restaurants we are meeting and have meals with our family or our friends so smoking is can disturb other people and can annoy us to have a good time with people. And smoking is not good for health. If you want to smoke in the restaurants you should go to the area that they allow you to smoke only and if you are smoking in the restaurant you will break the law. We should banned smoking in all restaurant completely for people who are the patience, babies, women and old people. Their come in the restaurant for eat not for smell and receive the bad smell like smoke. They should make the strong law for protect the right of people who do not smoking and support the way to stop smoking in the restaurants. So there are many reasons to limit the smoker and force them smoking in the right area but the importance things they should understand how bad of smoking and may think the way that they can stop smoking. All of this will help them make their health be better and tell the society is they will helped. Moreover they will proud of their doing and can tell to others that they can do it.
