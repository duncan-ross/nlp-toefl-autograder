I agree to a certain extent. Smoking is not only bad for health which leads to heart disease and cancer, it also affects the environment. By banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country, it will bring an advantage to the non-smokers and a disadvantage to the smokers. The advantage is that it will reduce the generation of secondhand smoke by smokers and enable non-smoking diners to dine at ease without having to inhale the secondhand smoke. The disadvantage is that there will be less public places for smokers to smoke and hopefully it will reduce their frequency of smoking eventually. If there is no complete banning, some inconsiderate smokers will smoke at their tables for the sake of convenience while some considerate smokers will go outside the restaurant and find a place to smoke. However, nobody should restrict where smokers may smoke as they have their own rights and freedoms. It is not their fault for choosing to smoke as they have their own choices despite knowing the harmful effects of smoking. They may smoke anywhere as long as they do not affect non-smokers. Some non-smokers are very particular about secondhand smoke as they know the harmful effects of it while some non-smokers are nonchalant about it.
