 All of us have been told that smoking is bad for health. Many kinds of harmful components are found in the smoke including carbon monoxide, tar, heavy metal and many kinds of substances. But still there are a lot of men smoking and more and more women are becoming smokers. Some people smoke just because they are sometimes embraced because when people pass them cigarettes by courtesy. And some just consider smoking as a cool act. But most people start smoke because of pressure. The have got too much work deep into the night, many of them smoke to defend drowsiness. Some of them smoke to get rid of pressure and annoyance. Maybe people just smoke for some important purpose at first, but soon they won't help but smoking out of habit. I don't think people should smoke in public, not only because smoking is bad for their health but also smoking harms other people. The smoke smokers breathe out and the smoke from the burning part is even more poisonous than the gas they breathe in. It harms many other people present who are not smoking. And the smell is definitely smoky. The best way to get rid of smoking is never taste it. One should choose better ways to get rid of pressure and drowsiness. And besides, smoking is not cool at all indeed!
