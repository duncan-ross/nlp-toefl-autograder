Many people think that students only have to get good grades in the college, but I disagree with the idea. There are three reasons for college students to have a part-time job. First, students can save some money, and know that it's not so easy to work. Thus they would not waste their parent's money to buy useless things. For some poor students it's also a good choice to earn more money. Second, students can choose the part-time job which is related to what they major in the university. By the chance, students can know more about their future career. And they can prepare for it from the time in the university. Third, and most important, students can learn many things that they will never know from the book, to open their mind and know the world earlier. It make college students know what the society is, and help them to know how to make friend with others and how to have a conversation with their boss. Due to the three reasons, I believed that it is important for college students to have a part-time job if the students could arrange their time for the study and part-time job very well.
