Nowadays students of college become more critical and think a lot about their life in future. And they know that the hardest part of adult life is working for money. With a step to go, they will live their life as an adult. And then, why don't they start their work life today? College students aren't same with an employer. They work hard more because living two kinds of profession, student and employer. Many people say that students' job is studying only, there's no need to work for money. Work for money is parents' job. But not every student is lucky enough to have parents with money to pay everything for them. That's a reason why college students need a job, although just a part-time job. It will train them to be a better person. A part-time job teaches how to socialize with others, how to manage money, and how to show a good behavior in front of others. Although they fail in this job, it will cause nothing. They still don't need money as much as an adult. They can find a new way for work. But sometime parents too much worry about their children who have a part-time job. They always have reasons to stop the children's job. I still have enough money for my kids, They will get sick if they still work hard like that, I want they have more concentration on their study, etc. There are many reasons that stop college students for work. Don't worry. It's just a little part of your life, students. Fight over it and you'll find a better future. Keep your hard work.
