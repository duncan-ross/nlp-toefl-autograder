I think I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because of these four reasons. First, a part-time job can give students many skills, many knowledge and many real world experiences that they can't receive from the classroom. For example, they can learn about life and foreign language from the peoples in their work. These may useful things for the best future. Second, a part-time job will make them to be responsible and to be on time. For example, they must share between study time and work time. Third, a part-time job can help them about their parents' spending, and it can teach them about spending money that they receive from working. For example, most students want a lot of money from their work to go shopping or to buy many things that they want such as cute accessories, new cosmetics, modern clothes, beauty shoes, ticket of the movies, notebook, camera, funny games, and mobile phone, but a part-time job will let them know that they would save the money. Finally, a part-time job can make many friends by working with other people. Students can do many part-time jobs such as washing dishes and waitress or waiter.
