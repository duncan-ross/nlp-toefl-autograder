I disagree with the above statement. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants as it is a personal right that smokers be allowed to do as they wish, as long as they are not negatively affecting others excessively. Non-smokers may argue that smoking produces negative externalities. This means that although they themselves are not smoking, they are forced to breathe in the second-hand cigarette smoke that smokers exhale, which is harmful to their health. They are suffering at the expense of the smokers, and because of this, they might propose for smoking to be banned at all restaurants. Even though restaurants in Singapore have allocated smoking areas, non-smokers often complain that the cigarette smoke travels to other areas. However, this argument is not valid as if smoking were to be banned in all restaurants, it would be fair to ban families with babies from dining at all restaurant too. This is because babies that cry create negative externalities, by disturbing tables nearby with the noise. Similarly, it would also be fair to ban someone with body odour from the restaurant s, as he or she would be causing others to suffer for no reason. Thus, we cannot ban smoking in all restaurants as if we were to do so, we would have to ban anyone who causes inconvenience to other diners, and this would create an non-exhaustive list of offenders.
