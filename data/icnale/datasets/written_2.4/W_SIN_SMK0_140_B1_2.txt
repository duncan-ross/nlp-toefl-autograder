Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in this country. Today in Singapore the government has banned smoking in many places like air-condition restaurants, food outlets and shopping centers. However, more can be done to protect the health of the people in Singapore by banning smoking at all restaurants in Singapore. There are many reasons for this stand, the following paragraphs will discuss on the advantages of banning smoking in all restaurants. The first reason is for the health of the smoker and the people around them. As we all know smoking is a very unhealthy habit to have. Not only will the smoker's health be affected the people around the smoker will also be affected by inhaling second hand smoke. Therefore in places like restaurants where there are a lot of people seated close to each other, the number of people being affected will be greater. If there is a banned on smoking in restaurants it will not only save the life of the smoker but also those around them. The second reason is to cause inconvenience to the smoker. By causing inconvenient to the smoker it will help the smoker to cut down their addiction. By doing this not only can the smoker cut down their addiction the younger children or youth would see less people smoking in front of them therefore also cutting down the number of bad examples they see on a daily basis. Therefore with the two advantages stated above I believe to a large extend that banning smoking in restaurants are needed and will bring Singapore to become a better country.
