Every day, he works until 11p. m. and he even has to attend to his 9a. m. class in the morning. He is a full time university student having a part-time job. It is a common practice and I believe it is important for university students to have a part-time job. First, some may argue that the government or universities offer grant and loan. Yes, that is true; however, the grant and loan do not cover all of the living fees and tuition fees. Students have to do part-time job for a living. For example, a student is granted some of the tuition fees but he/she has also to pay for the other portion of tuition fee and dormitory fee. Thus, having a part-time job would relieve their family's financial strain. Another point is that university student would like to have different exposure, like having high table dinners, joining study tours or even going to exchange. Such activities are a part of the university live and allow students to widen their horizon but they are costly. And that is the reason why students have to work in order to save some money for the activities fee. Although universities offer some sponsorship, it only benefit to some narrow group of students with the best academic result. Therefore, other students who want to join a study tour would have no choice but to get a part-time job. One more reason is that students would like to have working experience before university graduate. In such competing society, having a university degree is not enough for one to get a position in a big company. Students have good academic result with working experience would have some advantage. Having part-time jobs is not news to university students anymore. A part-time job not only grants a chance for a student to expose but also for he/she to get solid experience from the society and job market.
