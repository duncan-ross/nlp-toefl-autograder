As we know, smoking is bad for our health. But why do so many people smoke ? I don't smoke, of course. But someone who smoke a lot told me that he smoke because sometimes when he felt unhappy, he would smoke to release his feelings. I looked up some things about tobacco in the Internet, It started from America. But some researches show that in 650 D. C. People in Maya started to use tobacco. So it seems that smoking has a long, long history. And also as we know, a lot of great people are kind of addicted to smoking, such as Chairman Mao, Churchill and so on. Why are they so interested in smoking ?Of course they know it is bad for health. I think the main reason is that it can make them happy and feel less depressed when something bad happened. And it can make them think of problems better than without tobacco. So as I said, even though many people has proved that smoking is bad for our heath, I don't think it will disappear. As long as will have troubles, we will need tobacco. That's what I think.
