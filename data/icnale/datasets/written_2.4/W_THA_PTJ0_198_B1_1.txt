I think it is a great idea having a job while you are university student. I think that is a good idea. It effected good for me but It were damage too. First, I will talk about a good of work. I can use the top of the time. I am going to work when I have a free time. I don't want let time go free. Then I will get salary every month, so I have beg just beg a little money from parents. My parents have vary burden I don't want they were tried. I would like to help them and I didn't used to beg money from the parent. I will save money for it. Finally, you can have your own money. You don't have to ask for money to your parents. On the other hand earning you own money grows up you personality. It change your perspectives in life. You will see that you will think twice before spending money on something you think it is not necessary. You will learn to listen to the others. You will learn to be sure patience and sociable and you will learn how to communicate. When you get a job, while you are a student you have to think first if you handle it you must be very exacting with yourself.
