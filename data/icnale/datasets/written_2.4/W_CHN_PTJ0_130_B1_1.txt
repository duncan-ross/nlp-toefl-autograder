As is known to us all, many college students choose to take a part-time job in their spare time and this is a common phenomenon in our life. But here we need to talk about whether part-time job could actually do good to our college students. As far as I am concerned, I believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First of all, when we take a job, we could get a chance to learn to be independent. In the same time, we can use this chance to try to get along with others. What is more, as result, we can also get our financial reward and work experience as well which may be helpful in our future life. Furthermore, to take a part-time job provides us with an important opportunity to put what we have learnt from books into practice. However, every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages. Firstly, some students may spend a lot of time doing part-time jobs so that they just neglect their studies and this will affect their studies as a result. Secondly, some students may be cheated by others, because they don't know how to take good care of themselves and how to distinguish between right and wrong. In a word, I agree that students should try to get a part-time job which could help them to know something about society, but they should keep a balance between job and study.
