They come with their families look for finding a good environment there. Now days we often see that many people in restaurants are smokers. They are smoking there and are polluting the environment. They are disturbing the other people contently sitting in the nice place for pleasure. The just behave friendly towards the other people. Therefore smoking should be banned in restaurant because it is not only bad for the health of the smokers but also for the other people sitting at that place. The reason is that the stander of that restaurant would become low. And nobody would like to go such places where smokers are sitting and polluting the environment. In this way the economy of restaurant will decrease day by day. Families would not be able to come in restaurant for the sake of pleasure. Hence, the after effect of smoking is very disastrous whether it is done on road or in restaurants. And it should be banned in restaurants and at other places. Because without leaving this habit our country can't progress.
