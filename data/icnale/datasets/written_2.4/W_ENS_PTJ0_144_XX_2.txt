I disagree. There is so much to learn and take in that I think that it is extremely difficult to try to work and study at the same time, without creating a negative impact on one or the other. It was for me anyway and I ended up having to play catch up with my studies nine times out of ten which also put me in the position of nearly failing my degree. When I packed my job in, it felt like a load of bricks had been lifted off my shoulders and after that, I breezed through my degree with less stress, less headaches and I even got to sleep more and go out a lot more often then I had before. I would say that if students are having money problems, then I guess they just have to work, but it's not something that I would recommend to anyone, not if they want to do well, pass their degree and keep their sanity in tact. Everybody needs to decide for themselves I guess because it really depends on what's more important to them and also whatever they need to do to pass, then they just have to get stuck in and do it.
