I agree with it. It can not only help us improve ourselves by doing a part-time job, but also we can make some money in this process, it is important to some poor students. At the same time, it can help us communicate others better, so we can make more friends. In modern society, many companies take it that whether you have the related work experience as a standard to employ staffs. So if you want to find a good job after graduation, you have to have a appropriate part-time job. Of course, you can take many other ways to achieve these goals, such as holiday social practice, community benefit, and so on. But in comparison, you can't make money and it takes more time by these ways. So if you have no much time and want to earn a little money, it is the best way to exercise yourself that have a part-time job. But on the other side, learning is the duty of students; you can't affect your academic when you have a part-time job. In a word, as a college student, if you want to know the society deeply and improve yourself quickly, you'd better to have a part-time job.
