There is no doubt that part-time job is important for college students! At least I think it is. Because I'm a college student and I also have a part-time job at my university. Ok, let me tell you the advantage of having a part time job. First, you can earn some money from the part-time job. Though sometime the reward is not as much as we expect, anyway, to have is better than not to have. If ones family is poor, well, such money maybe a great help to his or her and also lower burden of the parents. If ones family is not poor, he or she can use the money to make the life better. Apart from the money, there is something we can learn which cannot be studied in book or bought by money. That is experience. The experience own to yourself and the experience can make you do better in the job. What is more, the experience may have a permanent affection of your future development. Whereas some college students think it takes a lot of time. So the time of study would be reduced, isn't it a loss for us? Surely, seldom the part-time jobs for the college students take much time. The worry is absolutely unnecessary. Consider above, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
