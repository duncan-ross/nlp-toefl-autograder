In my opinion I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because when people smoking their behavior may influence other people. Not the people all in this world like to smell the smoke. And even you smoke in the close room; people can still smell that smoke. It is not a good behavior to connect with people. Besides, I think when you smoke, you are kidding for your health. You don't care your life. And you don't protect your body. If you do that, I think you don't love your parents or you don't know what you do is deeply hurt your parents' heart. In other words if you want to be a good daughter or son you consider your behavior first. Besides, I never listen people to say that smoking is a good thing, I just listen some people and our government to persuade everyone not to smoke. If smoking is a good thing why not people bring up some point at this issue to support it. From know I just find that some people hope more one people to quite smoking so I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
