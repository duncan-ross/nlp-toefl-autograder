I completely agree and I fail to see why Japan is dilly dallying about with this. For God's sake, smoking is killing people every day and it would be banned completely if I had my way. I mean really, if people can't make use of the good sense that God gave them, then where is all going to end? Death and sickness caused by smoking will only get worse, not better if something is not done soon. Governments are so concerned about the environment, the ozone layer and the ecology these days, which is a good thing in my book. So, I have difficulty in understanding why banning smoking is not high on their list of priorities. These deaths and sicknesses are preventable because it is not a matter of good luck or bad luck that causes them. It is human error and behaviour, which can be corrected. We spend time and money educating our children in school and yet we do not spend an equal amount of money in enforcing what we are teaching once they leave school. I can only come to the conclusion that it is because of money. There is more money collected in allowing smoking through taxes and earnings than if smoking were to be banned. Every little bit helps and banning smoking in all restaurants in Japan and everywhere else, would certainly lower the human cost as far as death and sickness goes.
