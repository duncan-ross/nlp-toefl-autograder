Part-time job is said to be quite simple in some western countries. However, in China where the convention is that students shouldn't be involved in any thing but learning and studying, there is no environment for students to get a part time job. Furthermore, we have to think about why students should do part time job and what can doing part time job bring us, college students. The views of people who support doing part time job is that through doing part time job students can touch the society deeper and feel the invisible rules of adult world in person. Sometimes the income is another reason. Personally, the income can be ignored at most of conventions. When college students go out to do part time job, we can earn no more than 50 per hour. The average is just 20 per hour. Even the truth and our work can slightly impress us the real value of money and make us more grateful, it can not worth our time spending on it. Our college offers us abundant resource and we have no reason to sacrifice our opportunity of using these to do the part time job. In one word, the major mission for student is only studying.
