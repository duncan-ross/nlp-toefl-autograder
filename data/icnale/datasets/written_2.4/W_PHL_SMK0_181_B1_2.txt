Smoking kills around 56 million people per year. Tobacco is a "major health problem" in not only Southeast Asia but also the rest of the world. It is an unnecessary and addicting habit numerous people do. With the great advance in research we have made over the years I hope that by now we know better than harming our bodies. As a Lassalian, I believe that one way of encouraging people to quit this nasty habit is to ban smoking in all public restaurants. Smoking in restaurants could be frequently seen throughout our country. In most restaurants I have eaten at I have always seen people smoking frivolously, not caring that they are ruining the lovely meal people around them are trying to have. They should realize that they are not the only ones in that particular restaurant. There are families with children who are unknowingly taking in the smoke coming from their cigarette. I hope that these people finally realize that when they do smoke in public areas they are not only harming themselves but also the people around them. If they can't control their urge to smoke they should at least have the courtesy to do so in a private place where no one else would be affected.
