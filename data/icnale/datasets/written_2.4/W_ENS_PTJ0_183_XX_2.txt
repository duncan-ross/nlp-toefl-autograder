I agree that it is important but for some students, it might not be in their best interest to wok while they are trying to study. Perhaps in their case, they may be finding it too challenging to work and their studies are suffering because of it. In this situation and if money is not the only motivating factor, they may be able to stop working at their part-time jobs and get caught up or in control of their study time again. Quite frankly though, I genuinely believe that nearly all students would gain more value from college by leaving all the outside influences behind and just direct their efforts towards college only activities and studies. It is unrealistic to insist that these kinds of students need to work or that it is important for them, because clearly it would be unsuitable in their case and would be causing them hardships that could quite possibly be avoided. While there are a few benefits that could be gained from working part-time as in the previous case scenario, the negatives I that case would outweigh any positive gains and therefore, would not always be appropriate or important for them. Which is not to say that it wouldn't always be good for others.
