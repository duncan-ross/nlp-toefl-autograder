Yes, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At the first place smoking must be forbidden or banned in the country. Smoking doesn't help, smoking cannot bear benefits instead it causes danger to health or in other worse case scenarios death to the smoker. It has become fashionable in the world today to condemn smoking. However, smoking is still dangerous to one's health and people around them, the smoker. I admit that cigarettes companies are the major contributors or large tax payers it helps our country but we suffer worse than we benefit. As 15 years old non smoker college student I have the perspective of a bad side of smoking. I am not fascinated by the benefit of smoking which is relaxation, how would you relax if your body is collapsing due to harmful or dangerous substances inside a single stick of cigarette. Smoking kills, Smoking causes cancer, second hand smoke is dangerous. Now, is there any major reason to contradict my allegations towards this smoking ban topic? Thus, Smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It must be banned due to dangerous fruits to the people who use it and people around a smoker.
