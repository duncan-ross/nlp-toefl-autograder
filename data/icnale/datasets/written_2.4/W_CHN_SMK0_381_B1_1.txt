 Recently, many countries put forward the policies of banning the smoking in public places, which means the government begins to put much attention on this problem. In my opinion, this banner is beneficial to the citizens' health. And we all should protect this pure environment from the harm of smoking. As we all know, smoking does a great harm to lung, and will raise the rate to have cancer disease. So no matter where should we smoke and do harm to ourselves. Not only can smoking do harm to smokers, but also the second-hand smoke can be harmful to the people staying at the public places, because the second-hand smoke can cause a large influence on our body. If a child is on the scene, the damage to his little body is even larger. It may lead to a malformation! So how can we endure a person in a public place like restaurant smoking without any misgiving? Last but not the least, the pollution of cigarettes is also one reason why we should ban smoking. Regardless of the process or the result, the pollution is both large. When we get the step to protect the environment and advocate green-products, this problem must be handled as soon as possible. After the statements, we can see the importance to ban smoking in public places! Let us pay more emphasis on the problem.
