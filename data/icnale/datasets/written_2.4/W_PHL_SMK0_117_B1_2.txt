Many people nowadays, love to dine in a fine restaurant that caters people different cuisine and delicacies. But unfortunately, there are customers who really have to smoke especially after a heavy meal. The very main reason why people smoke after a heavy meal is for them to digest the food immediately right after eating. Smoking is a bad habit, it can harm others, it can cause air pollution and especially it can also cause fire. But we have to respect everyone's daily routine and habit, we cannot tell them to stop smoking especially if they are use to it. Telling them to stop smoking may also cause arguments and may lead to decreasing number of customers of a restaurant. As a student, I suggest that every restaurant should have a smoking area in order to have a organize and friendly environment. At least if they have smoking area, they can do whatever they want and they cannot harm others who doesn't want to be suffocated by the cigarette. But the Restaurant Management should not tolerate smoking, they also have to put a reminder that cigarette smoking is dangerous to they're health and the Smoking Area was made to protect from harm the Second hand Smoker.
