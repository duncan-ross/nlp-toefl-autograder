 Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. A paying customer has the right to smoke at whichever restaurant he chooses to patronize. However, if his rights come into conflict with the comfort of another person within the restaurant, then it would be unfair for that man to smoke in the restaurant. This is a dilemma most restaurants would face, whether there is a need for the restaurant to open smoking rooms to cater to the needs of smokers who patronize them. Some restaurants do entertain smokers and have private rooms just for them. But how much smoke can the room actually take? Unless the restaurant opens a whole different segment or partitions the restaurant, non-smoking customers would still inevitably be affected by the smoke. Some would argue that this judgement would be that of a non-smoker and would deem this statement unfair, but smokers have their rights to smoke outside the restaurant as and when they desire. There is no need to disrupt the comforts of those who are eating in the restaurant. Especially if its air conditioned. Furthermore, it is evident that the smoking community in Singapore is of a minority as compared to non-smoking individuals, leeway should be given to the majority group of non-smokers and they should enjoy the non-smoky environment which they have paid for in whichever respective restaurant. Smokers have the liberty to smoke outside the restaurant, and thus, do not receive the short end of the stick.
