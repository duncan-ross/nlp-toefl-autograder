"Smoking is bad to our hearth" has become a common sense among children and adults. Restaurants in Taiwan had set extra smoking areas before, and in recent years, all of them had banned smoking indoors. I think this is a necessary rule that should be set years ago. Smoking in restaurants is bad for not only the on who is doing it but also people around in many ways. First, it is pollution in the air. And the air with smoke in it harms our breathing system. It can cause lung cancer and disturb your concentration. Second, the ash can also arrives in your dishes. Your tongue may not be sensitive enough to feel it nor will your eyes be able to recognize it. But you actually put them in your mouth. The bad smell of smoke is abominable enough, not to mention the ash in your stomach. Finally, indoor places such as restaurants normally acquire air conditioners. In this case, doors and windows will be closed and the harmful smoke has no way out but being consumed by all customers at their tables. Based on all these negative effect smoking indoor causes, I strongly agree banning smoking in all restaurants.
