Past Time Job I'm extremely agreed with this topic. As I see, I think past time job is a good experience for teenagers. Not only experience but also money. We'll gain from this. In Thailand, Most of students spend their free time to do past time job on summer. Many interesting places that they are interested in such as KFC, 7/11, The Pizza Company etc. In High school, I had a friend who spends her free time to do past time job in KFC. I asked her about why you considered doing this job and she replied me that it was so far that her university will be start so she thinks if she only spends her time at home she might be bored so doing past time job. She might gain more experience from her colleagues and also gain money to use in the university. It was a good reason that she earns money by herself so it's save her parents money. Her parents can spent this money for other thing. I think most of student who done this job, they're grown up than others because they know the value of money. They had a lot of friends from doing past time job. It has widened their aspects and experiences.
