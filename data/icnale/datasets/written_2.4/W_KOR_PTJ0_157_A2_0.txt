And the university is first step for society. Thus we have to gain more experience and ability. Various occupations in life to meet a lot of people are very important. This will help a lot of job opportunities seem to be. Experience with various occupations, working part-time and gain experience in the process. And I think it is important to learn. In addition, through part-time job to learn from your mistakes. And then more will try to do better. Meeting many people and as a society can continue to learn. And you can feel money is valuable while make money. Because in the future earn a money by myself. Part-time job is early social life. Later, while living in the community will be very helpful.
