In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, students gain work experience before they enter the society. In this way, they can find what they are really interested in. By touching a variety of part-time jobs, they make their own decision. On the other hand, if they want to study graduate school, they can easily know what they want to major in. In addition, having a part-time job is helpful for university students' time management. For instance, they have to strike a balance between school and work. Also, this will help them to handle their business orderly and further have free time with friends. Finally, students know the difficulty of making a living. Most of their expenses are given by their parents so they don't have to worry about tuition. Take my friend for an example. She is the youngest one in her family and she relies on them or friends very much. Whatever she does, she used to find someone to help her. Although she is an adult in law right now, she is still childish. If she has a part-time job while study in college, she would be more mature. In brief, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because they can gain experience and learn how to make their time management, they even become mature after taking the job. Above reasons, it is necessary for them to take a part-time job.
