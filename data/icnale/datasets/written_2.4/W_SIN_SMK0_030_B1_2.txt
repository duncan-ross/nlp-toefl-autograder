Smoking is harmful to the human health. Smokers may not have the short-term effect from the smoking, but they are often end up with coughing and lung cancers. Cigarettes contain nicotine, which has been shown to potentially modify our nervous system, and thus make us addicted. The tars, another chemical from the cigarettes, could accumulate in the lung, and render our respiratory system badly functional. Even the second-hand smokers may suffer from diseases. The family members of a smoker tend to have lung problems as well in the long run. Singapore has enacted strict laws that ban the smoking in public area. The restaurants and hotels have prepared particular smoking area for the guests. Besides, the price of cigarettes in Singapore is quite high as compared to most other countries, which is another way to potentially stop the people from smoking. So, Singapore has done very well in regulating and controlling the population of smoking. The only benefit of the tobacco is the economic profit that it brings into the country. But overall, it potentially kills people and no other economic benefit could compensate this. So, my opinion is that the smoking should be banned in Singapore like all other drugs. Even the chewing gums could be prohibited by Singapore government, why not the much worse tabacco?
