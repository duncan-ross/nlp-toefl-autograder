In the present, many students have part time job. The part time jobs that they do are sellers in cloth shops, book store, cashiers, waiters in restaurant or employees. I think, it should to do because you can find money by yourself. It very proud for me. You can help your parents to save their expenditure and you can save money for yourself. The important thing which you get from part time job is experiences because you meet people, came from other place and other habit. The part time job can make you have more responsibility and reasonable. When you have those experiences, you can use them in your daily life and also to put it in your resume whenever you apply for a job. The part time job is the good one choice. It gives you many good things. Although, the part time jobs can have many good things but as a student your first priority is to study. You should do the part time job when you have a free time from studying, doing your homework or helping your parents job. If you can do this, I think the part time job is very good activity. You can manage your time and try to gain benefits from both study and part time job. I support the college students to practice themselves how to manage their life while being a students. Part time job may teach them something that they can apply in the future. However, study should be more important than part time job. Part time job should be optional for them.
