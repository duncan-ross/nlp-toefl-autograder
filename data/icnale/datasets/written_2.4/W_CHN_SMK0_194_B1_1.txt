There is no doubt that smoking is a bad habit. Many people in recent years have discussed the possibility of banning smoking completely in the restaurant. There is no argument anymore as to whether cigarettes are unhealthy or not. They can cause cancer, we all know, but we just can't stop smoking. So, from my point of view, the government should take some steps to ban it. Many countries now have laws banning smoking restaurants, because it is the place that people are eating and I am pretty sure that those people don't want to eat around the cigarette. For me, when I smelled the cigarette I want to throw up. I can't stand it. What's more, this is the public place. It is completely unreasonable to smoke. Some countries have taken actions to solve the problem. I think our country also needs to have laws to ban smoking in the restaurant. Also, I hold the view that the smokers should care about his or her own figure because smoking in the public place is immoral. Those persons don't care about others feelings. They are selfish!In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is perfectly right, for you for us, for all the people think it will benefit to us. So I support it!
