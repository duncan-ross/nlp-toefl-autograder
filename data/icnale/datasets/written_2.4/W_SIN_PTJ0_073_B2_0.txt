I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. While it may prove a viable income for some and potentially provide a wealth of experiences, I am of the belief that a college student's main objective is to expend himself in his academic pursuits. Throughout my years in college, I sought part-time work as a private tutor. This lasted four years, during which time I accumulated much teaching experience and developed several skills, such as conflict resolution and time management. I was glad to have the opportunity to help weaker students and make an impact on their lives. At times, I found the work fulfilling and enjoyable. However, despite the benefit of extra pocket money, the job was an additional source of stress, and the responsibility regrettably compromised the quality of my schoolwork. Students who do not mind such a compromise should definitely try their hand at a part-time job. Such extra-curricular work is also ideal for those with a lot of free time, or for whom money is tight. However, it certainly is not important or necessary for every single college student to hold a part-time job --- it is instead something to be pursued at leisure.
