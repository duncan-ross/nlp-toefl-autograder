I'm agreeing with it. I think that a lot of money is the important for high learning because it will use a lot of money because it is mere expensive. The students may be don't enough of the money, so they should earn money for spend in the daily life by themselves. lf who is poor, he will work a part—time job. They can get a lot of money for education funds. Also, they can buy other stuffs. They can find a geed experience without study in the class. They will de something have a useful. A part—time job has many ways. They can choose time when they are free to work after class. They don't go to everyday, but they will get the money when they go there. It is easy prefer full time because they can have money between studies. They can work a jobs that their like. Many students work in the restaurant, the hotel, seven-eleven and ethers shop such as waiters. waitress, receptionists, guide, seller etc. A part—time job helps they have responsible and a geed experience for them. The students must manage time because they are study and work it is hard for them.
