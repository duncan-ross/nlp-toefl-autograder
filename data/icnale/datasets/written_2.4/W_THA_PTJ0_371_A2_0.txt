All of people hope to get a good job in the future. Of course, I think this topic may depend on people aptitudes. From my point of view, there are many aptitudes for people to get the good job, especially "Is a part-time job important for college students?" the first reason that is important for college students, because some families have a few budget to support their children to school and university. So the college students have to work for getting more money to support themselves. The second reason is, whenever students have to use more money, but they would not like to disturb their parents they can earn some money by themselves by taking part-time job. The third reason, if the would like to pay their time effectively they can take apart-time job. Beside they pay their times efficiently, they also fun with their job. The fourth reason, part-time job makes students being really proud to gain new experience and earn much money by themselves. For the last reason, part time job can be a thing that makes students have great responsibilities, such as punctuality, being honest and relationship with other people. To sum up, I would not like to focus on "part time job is important or unimportant for college students, but if students take a part time job while they are studying, they can learn the true meaning of responsibilities.
