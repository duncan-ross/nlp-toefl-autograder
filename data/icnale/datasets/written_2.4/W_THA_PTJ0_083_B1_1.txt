Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I think part-time job is important for some student that would to have money for bought thing without his or her parent money. In some part-time job is look like full-time job that give employee to be salesman all day & night. This job will start when he have contact with other people and talk about his sale and invite other to joined his job and he will get rank up from his number that he has invited. In some time who do this job is make other people boring with his or her doing. This job is look like chain I think in long time it may have full of people have that same part-time job and this chain could be end. An other part-time jobs example 7/11 employee is a one good job that doesn't disturb other people and this job have certain times in each day must do his job. I think people will have job should be learn about his job clearly for his advantage in his job and don't to make other people worry with his job that would be appropriate to have part-time job.
