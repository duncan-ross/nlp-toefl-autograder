I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students already lead very busy and hectic lifestyles, with schoolwork and co-curricular activities etc. If they were to get additional part-time jobs that required many hours of commitment especially, this may affect their studies and also their enjoyment level. Many say college is the last period where students get to enjoy a relatively carefree life before stepping into the real world where there are high levels of stress and things to worry about. As such, I feel that as a college student, one should place emphasis on enjoying their college life, rather than going out to work and building up their resume. On the other hand, there are views that support college students having a part-time job. One main supporting view is that part-time jobs prepare students for working life in future and also provides them with a comfortable source of pocket money, thus instilling independence in them where they do not have to ask their parents for pocket money. However, I feel that this is not the case as many students use these jobs as a source of additional pocket money and still take money from their parents. Furthermore, with this extra money, we find that there are many students who use this money irresponsibly and end up with the bad habit of being a spendthrift. Overall, I feel that it is more important for college students to focus on their studies rather than jobs as studying and getting a degree is after all their main purpose for going to college.
