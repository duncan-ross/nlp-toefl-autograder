 I think everyone will agree that smoking is harmful to people's health. In human society, smoking in public is seemed as some rude behavior, no matter what country and culture you live. Smoking has such bad effects as follow. Firstly, it will cause apparent damages to your lung. Most people smoke just for the temporary comfort when they are in trouble. They say smoking can help release their mental burden and forget all problems for a while. When people feel nervous upset or worried, smoking comes to their final choice——the only comfort. That may explain why so many people are addicted to smoking. But does it real work, I don't think so. Secondly, smoking will do much more harm to the people around the smokers. Especially for children and pregnant women, smoke will bring incurable influence to them. According to some statistics, smoking is the main cause to lung cancer. Every year, the amount of people dying from lung cancer is incredible, just less than the amount of death caused by car accident. Sometimes we say that smoking is an invisible killer. At last, smoking should also cost much money, and that will add one man's financial burden. Even smoking may also bring family conflicts.
