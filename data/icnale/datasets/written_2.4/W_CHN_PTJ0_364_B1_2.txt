Based on my own experiences, I believe it is both rewarding and beneficial for us college students to work outside in our spare time as long as we maintain an adequate balance between study and part-time jobs. Part-time working experiences can bring us great benefits from various aspects. To begin with, students are enabled not only to better understand what they've learned from books but also to gain more practical skills from the society such as the ability to communicate and cooperate with others. Your potential can be fully developed through the process of dealing with various difficulties while working in the society. In addition, part-time jobs help students accumulate working experience which will benefit their future job hunting. As more and more well-educated graduates are flocking to the job market, companies pay more attention to the practical experience when selecting the proper employees they need. Last but not least, part-time jobs help to relieve financial burden of college students especially those from poor families. Working outside in their spare time proves to be a good way to earn tuition fee as well as the cost of living. However, while we are taking a part-time job, we should not forget that study is our main task at school. Only in this way can we acquire the useful knowledge and skills both in and out of schools.
