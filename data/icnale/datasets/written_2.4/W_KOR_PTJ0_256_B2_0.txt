I agree the argument that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. College students should share their parents' burden because the tuition is too high by doing part time job. They can be motivated to save money after difficult experience for earning money. Lastly, they can learn many useful things. Here are some reasons for this statement. First of all, in Korea, due to the high rate of tuition students have to share their parents' burdensome by doing a part time job. Korea is one of the countries which have most expensive tuition. To cut family's economic problem, students can try to earn their allowance from payment of part time job. Second, most college students do not know how hard earning money is because they are familiar with getting money from their parents. Through new experience of part time job, they can recognize thanks for parents. Lastly, from part time job, students can learn a lot of useful information. For example, they can learn the way of patience when they feel angry and the importance of keeping kind and polite attitude in social relationship. For those reasons, I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job. In Korean situation, they should share economic burden and they can learn many useful things from doing part time job.
