There are not much people like smoke from smoking. I think it must be banned in the public area because it not harms only the one who smoke but it harm the people around them. So, the place like restaurants that child and family come together Smoking should have banned. For many years that I saw the paper of no-smoking area especially in the restaurants and they still smoking and don't care other people so, I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking make restaurants look terrible It smell bad The one who like it is only the smoker who smoked and it wrong to harm others people. Why shouldn't they smoking in a smoking area. I think they should have a law about smoking and use it strictly and allow the police to catch the one who doesn't smoking in the place. I have known many of my friends who allergic the smoke and they say it make them can't breathe well. And I think many of people don't like it too. I think smoking should be banned at the restaurants. If it have banned It Not only good for the people but for the restaurants itself. Because it make restaurant look better and attractive the customer.
