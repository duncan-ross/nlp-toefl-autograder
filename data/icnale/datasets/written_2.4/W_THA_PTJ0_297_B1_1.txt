I absolutely agree with that topic because a part-time job will make someone has a skill with other older people, studying in the college is not enough for the world business right now. The students must have a great moral together with the best knowledge as they can. And the things that make them to be that point is the working with as many as people they can do with, first thing first, attending in every classes and every activities you interesting, while you are doing your job, make friendly with the other people there, not only the close friends, but also the leader and every important persons in that job, and preparing yourself for the job coming or doing the things you see them should have done with appropriately. Actually, every time you doing job, you'll face much of the obstacle in your unable with something. Do not be waiting for that, asking the leader for fix that problem. I think, just doing this, the working skill for the future is absolutely done a little. But you must be forget about studying in classes and the outside class for nice grade when you graduate, you will find a beautiful smiles from your family and your friends especially your lovely teachers.
