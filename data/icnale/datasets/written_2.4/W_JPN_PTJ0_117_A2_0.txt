I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are three reasons why I think so. First reason is that having a part time job is useful for us to experience life in society. Second reason is that having a part time job is valuable for us to choice what vocation we wish to follow on the future. If we never have had a part time job, when we become a member of society, we don't have realistic knowledge about our potentialities, or we don't know enough about the many kinds of work available or even enough about the kind of work we think we wont to do. If we have had a part time job, we can increase our knowledge and understanding about society, so we can lay that much better a outlook for choosing our vocation. Third reason, this reason is the most important for me, is that we can earn allowance by having a part time job. For example, in my case, I have been having a part time job since I became a high school student. I saw earning money is terrible difficult, so I became not to waste money. I think we can realize importance and value of money by earning money ourselves. With these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.
