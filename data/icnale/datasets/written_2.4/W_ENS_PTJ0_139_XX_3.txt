I agree, providing that the students have good study/work balancing skills. If they don't, than the students may become even more stressed about trying to juggle and balance their time in between studying, work and of course, spending time with their friends. If they can come to grips with this, then I think that it would be good for them to have a part-time job because of the important benefits to be had. Whether that is extra cash for fun, easing their financial burden or just the all important work experience which will give them a head start in the job hunting stakes, either way it's a good thing and can only help. If however, they struggle with time management, are easily stressed by what seems to be too many commitments or it just starts to get too much for them, then I seriously recommend that they let go of the job and stay on track with their studies. There are many that perform this balancing act between work, study and still having leisure time quite easily. I think that it really is a case by case situation that each individual needs to explore for themselves and what works best for them.
