Banning smoking at restaurants has been a matter of debate in many of the United States for at least the last 20 years. It therefore does not surprise me that the issue has begun to arise in Japan as well. Because it is the same issue, I feel that many of the arguments that are often brought up when it is discussed in the American context will also lend themselves to being applied well in the Japanese context. I do not intend to summarize these issues, but rather to state that we can wait and see how things play out in America for both the smokers and the nonsmokers, and depending on the outcome, Japan will have a great example about how it should go about dealing with the same issue in that country. I think that everyone in the world should stop being so enveloped in their own country's affairs and look to other countries for guidance especially when the matter at hand is one that has already found a solution. Therefore, I submit that the Japanese populace should be patient until the time when America finds a good solution on this issue as a whole country, because if just a few states find a solution, that is not really applicable on a nationwide scale.
