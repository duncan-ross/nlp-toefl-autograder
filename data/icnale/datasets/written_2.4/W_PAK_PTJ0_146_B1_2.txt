Part time job is a job done for few hours, in the industrial societies the job hours are divided in two categories. One is full time job and the other is part time job. Full time job mean eight continuous hours while the part time job varies from four to six hours depending on the nature of the job. In such societies people are paid on the basis of their working hours. For example eight or ten dollars per hour were paid to the workers in USA in 90s. Now the part time job has made his place in eastern or back ward countries like Pakistan. The most popular example of part time job in our country is the job of call centers. At call centers the people work round the clock in different shifts and without caring for day and night. Mostly students are doing these kind of jobs to increase their pocket money and increase their experience of practical life. Although this is a healthy trend to increase the money and income and a good way to keep the mind and body busy and working in a positive way even yet it is having some bad effects as well. So all time running after money is not a healthy thing.
