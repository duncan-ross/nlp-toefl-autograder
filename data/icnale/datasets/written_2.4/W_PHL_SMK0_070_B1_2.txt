Not only does smoking kills the person using it, but also the people who are inhaling the smoke. Second hand smoking is what they call it. If you never heard of that, it means that the smoke coming out of a cigarette is almost twice as poisonous and toxic compared to actually using it. Either you are a user or an inhaler it is still the same time. That is why as a person who doesn't smoke, I would like to push for a law to stop smoking in Restaurants around the country. Why is this so? Ever experience going inside a bar a restaurants where you can smell the smoke coming out of the smoking area? For me, this happened to me a lot of times already since I love eating in such kind of bar and grill restaurants. I know that that as a student, I don't have any right to implement this to all restaurants all over the country because there will always be a conflict of interest between the people who are supporting this campaign and the people producing cigarette and bar and restaurant owners. However isn't it that we are the ones killing our environment and ourselves? Doesn't the future generation deserve to see the beauty of our nature before it gets destroyed by pollution? My answer to that entire question is yes. We should start finding a solution for this problem of smoking. Even if my suggestion will not be recognized by those authority responsible, I am encouraging everyone who are using cigarettes to limit smoking in areas where there are a lot of people around him or her
