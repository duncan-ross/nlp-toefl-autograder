I don't believe that every college student should have a part-time job. It is not necessarily important, because what are important are your studies. As a college student, I think having a job, even though it's part-time, will just distract students and it might be a reason for us to get low grades. I 'm not saying that we're not supposed to have a job. It still depends whether the student can balance his/her time studying and working at the same time. But we should also consider the capabilities of the student and their study habit. If they are not very good when it comes to their academic standing, it is not recommended for them to enter a job. But if they love to study, and at the same time help their parents regarding their tuition fees, then I think it is just fine. Some students are already having a hard time balancing their times when it comes to studying, so I really think that the companies or the employees should know first the reason why they want to work, and also know how they do in school. Because before a student can be a good employee, he/she must learn everything they have to know in school.
