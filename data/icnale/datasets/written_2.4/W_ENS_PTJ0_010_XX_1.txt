It is extremely important for college students to have a part-time job. It teaches us to be responsible and it also teaches us the real value of money, but more than that, I think college student should have a part-time job so that they can learn to be real adults and stop depending on their parents so much. I have been working part time since I was only 12 years old, so I have no sympathy for some of my friends whose parents seem to have done everything for them. Now, some of my friends think that it is unfair that they don't have extra spending money because their parents stopped giving it to them, but I think they should just did a part-time job and do something for themselves for once. Next, a part-time job is a great way to get used to working in the real world. Some college students just have work study jobs, but these are very different from what they will experience once they graduate from college. Therefore, I think it is good to get a real part-time job at a real company not affiliated with the school as soon as possible both in order to make some extra pocket money as well as to start conditioning yourself for a real career.
