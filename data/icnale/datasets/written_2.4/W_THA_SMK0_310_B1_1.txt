I agree with this topic. I think that the restaurant is a place for relaxing or meeting with family, friends, or lover. It is a good time to talk or sharing some ideas. There are a lot of foods, good atmosphere, and many people all of age. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it makes smell bad to another. It will have directly problem to yourself such as you will not have good health; the disease might increase, and can make you lost of money. Everyone all ready know that there is bad side than good side, so smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Moreover, smoking will make you have bad personality and not good for the children in the society. All adults should give good thing to the children. Stop smoking can make the world have fresh air, you will have good looking; don't make any trouble to the others. It is a good chance to stop smoking because it not has benefit with you but it is more advantage with another in the society too. If you not or stop smoking everyone in the society will live with happiness and get the best life.
