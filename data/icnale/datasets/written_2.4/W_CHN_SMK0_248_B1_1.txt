 It is just during the last few decades man had become generally aware of the harm of smoking. However, instead of dropping in last decade, the number of smokers has been on rising, especially of the teenagers. The situation has caused great concern among the people. There are several reasons that account for fact, but the following three may be the main ones. First of all, it is easy for teenagers to get cigarettes. Cigarettes are available almost everywhere. Today's teens have more spare money, which comes from the improved living standard of their parents. They can buy what they want, including cigarettes. Second, teenagers smoke because their adolescent years are filled with psychological problems. One of these problems, for example, is establishing a sense of identity. The teen years are the time when young people want to be more independent from their parents and from their own values. The enormous mental pressures of these years can make some people turn to smoking. Last, and perhaps most important reason is peer pressure to conform. Teens often become very close to special friends, for one thing, and they will share a attend parties and other social gatherings where it is all-important to be one of the crowd, to be cool. Even the most mature teenager might be tempted to smoke than to risk being an outcast. For all these reasons, cigarettes are a major problem facing teenagers.
