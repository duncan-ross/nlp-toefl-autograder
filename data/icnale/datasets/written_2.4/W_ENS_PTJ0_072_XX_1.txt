I agree with the topic that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, they should make sure that they only have a part-time job if they are able to balance it with that demands of a busy school schedule. I think that students are supposed to be in college to go to school, and things that get in the way of that are kind of counterproductive. It is important to learn how to work quickly and efficiently so that if you have a large project on your hands, you can deal with it well. Companies will appreciate students who have developed this skill as they can make better use of their time and the salary of their pay by the company and produce higher quality work. Finally, students to engage in part-time work in college are finding ways to expand their horizons and expand their experience in college. This is an important and basic part of any college, and choose students should do as well as they can in order to find ways to brighten their futures and give them self experience that they can take advantage of for their entire lives.
