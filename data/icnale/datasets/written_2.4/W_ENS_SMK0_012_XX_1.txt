I think that it would probably be a pretty good idea to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in Japan. Here in Colorado, smoking has been illegal in restaurants for kind of a long time, and I think this makes our states seem much more healthy and clean. Of course, there are the arguments of health and second hand smoke and more, but the real reason I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants is because it negatively impacts the experience. People go to restaurants because they want to have a good time and eat some food that they cannot cook by themselves, so I think that smoking in a restaurant is kind of like an insult both to the cook who works very hard to make delicious food as well as to the other patrons who are there to enjoy themselves. If I went to a restaurant and was talking very loudly or making a lot of noise I think you would be safe to say that a lot of other customers and would be very unhappy. To me, smoking in a restaurant is practically the same thing, and so in order to be polite to people around you, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants.
