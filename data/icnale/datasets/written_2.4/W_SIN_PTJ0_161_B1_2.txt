Personally, I find it important for students to have part-time job. This is because the lessons learnt when working which are not taught under school curriculum. In addition to earning more money that can act as a valuable source of income to fund their hefty school fees so as to lessen the families' financial burden, they get to learn life-long skills. For instance, in schools, the students are only taught theories and less of applications. Hence they do not understand how to apply all these theories to real life. This is contradictory given that the aim of schooling should be to equip students with the necessary skills to enter workface after graduation. Thus it is only during working that students gain exposure to the real world and apply all these theories. Upon application, they can understand the mechanisms of the real world, thereby enhancing their learning skills. This brings learning to a whole new level. Apart from this, students also get to build up their interpersonal relations. This is vital because upon graduation, students will need to work with other people in the company. Having good interpersonal relations will enable them to cooperate and work efficiently with others, not only benefitting the company, but also enhance the image of them being portrayed to others. In all, it is important for college students to have a job because it teaches them real-life working skills which cannot be taught under the school curriculum. It complements nicely with the school curriculum by enhancing learning so that students can understand how all these theories fit into place in the real world, bringing learning to a whole new level.
