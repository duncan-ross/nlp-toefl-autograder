Smoking is a very harmful habit, and as such, they should not allow it to happen at any place is that are public like restaurants. This is to say that I agree with this statement that they should ban smoking at restaurants in Japan. One problem they will face is that many restaurants sell cigarettes and make part of their profit from doing that, so the restaurants may be unwilling to ban smoking because they will be giving up some money. The tobacco companies who have investments in the restaurants will also be similarly unhappy because they do not want to see their profits evaporate. However, I think that human health is much more important than money, and so no matter how much money may be lost by the decision to ban smoking in restaurants, it should be banned as soon as possible. The longer we allow this to continue the harder it will be to eventually get rid of it, and there is no way that it will stay around forever. Why not just take the plunge now and do what we should've done a long time ago throughout the entire world. Japan could be the first country in the world to make a statement by banning smoking at restaurants as a nation, and if they do so, many other nations are likely to follow suit.
