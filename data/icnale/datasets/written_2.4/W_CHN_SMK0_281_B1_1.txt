 Many countries made a law, which is forbid to smoking in the all restaurants Though I agree with the government, I think it can not solve this situation. it is not a great way to solve. Smoking frog is harmful to our body, not only the smokers, but also the people who stand around him or her in some public places, Especially in the restaurants. If someone smokes, the air will be polluted. So many people breathe the frog, which is bad for their lungs and will influence people's moods. In my opinion, the measure is not suitable, those smokers need to smoke, they need a place to smoke in the public place, and we can correct it. For example, we can set a smoking room in order to their needs. In the world we must treat everyone equally. Though we hate smoking, Someone who be addicted to smoking need to smoke, they can not stop smoking right now, if you do not let they smoke, they will be hurried. Nowadays we must treat them with love, we need to think about in the other hand. In this way, we can solve this problem better. So I believe the world will be in concordance.
