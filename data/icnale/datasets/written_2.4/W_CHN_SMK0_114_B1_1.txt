I can't agree more with the suggestion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, it has been universally known that smoking is harmful. It not only does harm to the smokers themselves but also to the innocent people around. In addition, for the women who often smoke, it can affect the health of their unborn babies greatly. Secondly, in order to smoke, the smokers have to buy cigarettes. Always a bag of cigarettes is very expensive. Therefore, heavy smokers must bear a large pay for smoking. To them, they are just taking out of their money to harm their health. It is quite unwise. Also, there will be lots of people eating at the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants can make the restaurants dirty and influence others. While smoking, people produce a lot of harmful gas into the air. It is bad to our environment. What's more, the behavior people smoke in the public can reflect how rude they are. So in order to build a modern and peaceful country, it is a good way to put a ban on smoking in the public. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should not only be banned at the restaurants but also throughout all the public places.
