For me, Smoking in restaurants is very bad and unethical. It must be banned Immediately. In fact, In all the studies it was observed that the restaurant smoking ban had had a direct effect. After the ban there was an immediate reduction in the number of heart infarct victims admitted to hospitals. They should smoke on the right place like a smoking area or something. I've actually developed asthma and I 'm extremely sensitive to smoke of any sort because of being around it so much when I was younger. I think there should be certain smoking places like little areas around for people to smoke in. That way they could still smoke but bystanders wouldn't need to be exposed to it. I think all restaurants should ban smoking. I care about my health. Definitely they shouldn't be allowed to smoke in family-friendly places where children and babies are. If smoking is something they're going to do, they don't have to share the negative effects with everyone. If they want to slowly kill themselves they can do it in their own homes and not where other people are going to be affected by it.
