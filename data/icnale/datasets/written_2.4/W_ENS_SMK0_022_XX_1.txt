I think that it is a shame that so many people feel they have the right to impose their opinions on others. The more rules we have placed on our behavior the less free we are, and I think it is common knowledge that both the United States and Japan are free countries. Citizens should be able to do as they please as long as this does not interfere with others. This situation is very similar to the people trying to ban guns. Most owners and users of guns are very responsible people who are properly trained in the use of guns, but there are a few bad people who are ruining it for us all. It seems that there are some very inconsiderate smokers out there who aren't doing much to help nonsmokers be accepting of their habit and may be doing so by smoking in restaurants and other public places. If smoking was banned in restaurants and restaurants in Japan I don't think it would be a huge deal because they can always still smoke outside. The thing that worries me is that the next step will be to ban smoking outside as well and this would truly be a breach of civic freedom.
