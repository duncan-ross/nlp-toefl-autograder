I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Why do I say? First, when we graduate from college, everyone have to get a job. Why not get a part-time job early to learn about social experience? It is very important to be trained about social quality when student period. If you have not any skill of social, you would afraid of working after graduation. Second, it will make students understand the toil of work that let them to cherish thing. Almost students don't worry about cost of living, because their parents would provide finance to them. So they are easy to waste money. However, when they make money by themselves, it would let them to use totally about money, time, thing, and so on. Third, if you have a part-time job that could make you easily use money. Although, job can make someone learn more experience, it also can bring other money to self. That is a very special mode to learn about controlling money. Someone will make use of money to do more things. For example, learning language, saving, dancing, shopping, and traveling, and so on. I have a part-time job in my college life now, so I agree totally about the idea. Maybe someone disagree my thought. So what? Everyone is in charge of itself.
