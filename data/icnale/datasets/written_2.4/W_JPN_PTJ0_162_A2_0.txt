I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Last year, I became a college student. And I knew that college students have a lot of time because their school hours are shorter than that of high school students. That's why a lot of people join club activity or circle activity. And some people who are interested in foreign country go abroad for the purpose of language study or specialty study. Naturally, club activity, circle activity, and studying abroad need not only long free time but also need a lot of money. Students may get money from parents, but I think that they should get money by themselves because they are not just children. The reason why I recommend a part-timer of a college student is that not only a reason that it merely becomes an income source but also it can become good experience for their future. For example, when I worked in restaurants, I must learn that I try to always behave to a visitor in a polite manner. And when I work as a part-timer of a lecturer in a private supplementary school, I must learn a way to teach things intelligibly. So that there are two reasons such as the above, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
