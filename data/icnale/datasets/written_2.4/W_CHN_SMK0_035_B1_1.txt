As to the topic, I think smoking is supposed to be completely banned at restaurants in the country. First, restaurants are public places where people go to have their meals. If you are a non-smoker and hate smoking very much and you find yourself surrounded by smog when you are seated in the restaurants, what is your feeling? Do you still in a mood to eat? In this case, smoking in a restaurant leads to other customers' unhappiness and the atmosphere won't be good. On the other hand, we should let smokers know how to behave differently in various occasions. Smokers should be taught to respect others. By not allowing them to smoke at all the restaurants in the country, we are reminding them the above necessary qualities. Then, as we all know, second-hand smoking does great harm to people's health. People may have cancer if exposed to second-hand smoke for a long time. To protect people from being sick, and assure them a healthy environment to enjoy themselves, smoking should not be allowed by all the restaurants in the country. Above all, in the long run, if smokers are banned from smoking at all the restaurants in the country, they will gradually get used to it. By then, the world will be a wonderful one to live in. In a word, it is a pretty good idea to ban people from smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
