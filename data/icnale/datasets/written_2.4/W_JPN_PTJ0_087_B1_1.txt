I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Because college students have a lot of times. So they will play a lot, and to spend much money. Through this life, college students will think that to need to make money. Student will think to work part time job. That is to say, college students have a lot of time, and they want to kill time, and they want to make money for playing. Part time job's advantage is to get social experience. I think college student's common sense is different from social common sense. Sociality's senior relationship is strict. But college students will not know that. So they need to learn social rule. It is rare time for college student to speak to senior or elder. And working is hard. Senior may be angry about you. But sometimes senior praise about you. You become happy, so you will try your best. It is important for student to select the part time job interest you. Because it relates future and relates motivation. A rewarding job becomes people to do your best. Through these hard work, you will get result of money, so you will think money's importance. So you will become not to waste money. Through these experiences, you will growth and you find a steady job.
