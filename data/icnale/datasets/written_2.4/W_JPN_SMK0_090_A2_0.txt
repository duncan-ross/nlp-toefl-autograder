I agree with the opinion that smoking at all the restaurants in the country should be completely banned. There are three main reasons. First, when I have some dishes in a restaurant and there is the person who smokes in the nest seat, I will feel bad with my dishes even if how much delicious those are. Second, the top of tobacco with a little fire is very dangerous. Perhaps when I go through near a smoking person, my skin will be little burned. If the width of aisle in the restaurant is small, that probability will be increased. And there are many things which is burned easily in the restaurant so it will be a cause of fire when it is not diminished properly. Third, anyway, smoking is very bad for health. There are many diseases like cancer caused by smoking. And actually, the bad effects of smoking are bigger for those are near smoking people than smoking people themselves. The people who against this opinion will propose that restaurant is a place for rest so it is free to smoke there. But if you care for the others, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
