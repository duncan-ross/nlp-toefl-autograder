I have a part-time job, and all of my friends have part-time jobs too. We think that it is very important to have a part-time job in college so that you can have money to spend on the weekends. Socializing and making new friends is very important for college students and having a part-time job allows you to meet new people on the job but also allows you to meet new people when you go out on the weekends. Everyone knows that it's not what you know but who you know, and all of my friends who've already graduated tell me that if you don't have a contact at the company you want to apply for, you probably won't get hired. But so, I think only an idiot would not want to have a part-time job because if you don't have one, you are basically limiting yourself in the opportunity's you have to find work after graduation when you want to start a career. Also, you can learn a lot of great things at a part-time job. For example, I work at a gardening store, and I have learned a lot about the names of all the flowers that we have. My girlfriend really likes this because I can always prepare the best flower for any occasion, and that makes me feel very good. I think that all students should have a part-time job.
