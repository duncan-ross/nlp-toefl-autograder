Recently, the news about a master degree graduate in Chinese University of Hong Kong is unemployed for two years cause a big impact to Hong Kong citizens. Someone thinks it is because his personal skill is not enough. Someone thinks it is because he does not have work experience. So should the university students do a part time job? In my personal view, it is important for university students to have a part time job.. People always expect that University graduate should have high standard. They expect that we should have good knowledge with our field, good communication skill, interpersonal skill, good sense of society issue. With so many expectation, but school only provide us with teaching in academic stuffs. How can us to fulfill others expectation? Having a part time job is a good way for us to equip ourselves better. When we are working, we can have a chance to practice what we have learned. Working with other people can improve our communication skill and interpersonal skill. The most important thing is that we can realize a real working environment that can broaden our horizon and gain more work experiences. In conclude, having a part time job can bring us many benefit.
