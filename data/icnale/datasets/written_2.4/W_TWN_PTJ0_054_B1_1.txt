I slightly agree the importance of a part-time job for college students. First, I think the chief reason for going to school is to learn. Some people may think they can also learn a lot in a part-time job. But, the things could learn from job we also could lean from school too. We are students, the first thing for us is to increase our knowledge of what we major, if the job is most important then you don't have to go to school. And the things we can also learn in school include the attitude for how should we treat other people, how to blending with others, how to reach a goal, etc. These things we can learn not only from jobs but college. Second, some people may try to earn some other money for live a good life. But I think most of college students are working for the pocket money, not the cost of living. In this situation, it would not be a problem of living for if you don't have a part-time job. So I only agree the importance for college students to have a part-time job is whose income is for living or tuition.
