I think smoking is bad, but the society needs. Today our pressure is growing with the new technology and globalize. We even have little time to exercise or some ways to set out the pressure. Many adult smoking for a lot of reasons. If government wants to ban, I think the crime will grow up because the cigarette market is large today. The government can't ban at all, but it can restrict the smoking place to improve citizens healthy. I agree this policy. If any, separate smoking people and non-smoking people at same place also a good idea, because everyone has his own freedom. Citizen need to have a healthy environment. I think the correct education is the basic important thing. Government should make this aspect well. But nowadays too much people smoking, banning smoke from public places maybe a good and direct way. Fist, this can protect those who are not smoking people. They don't have to endure the bad air around them. Second, this policy can let the smoking people reduce a lot cigarette a day. Because they need to find somewhere they can smoke, they may think it's very inconvenience. For the reason, they may quite smoke gradually.
