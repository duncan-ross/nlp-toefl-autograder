While a great many of my friends and family think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job or seek some form of supplementary income, I simply do not think it is that important for college students to have a job. First, in many large ways students already have a job. Their job is to be students. Their job is to learn to go to school. They should not be required to work as a kid easily lead a distraction from their studies and have a negative impact on their performance in classes. In college, we always say that you can only pick two of the three areas which are good grades, sleep, and a social life. The fact of the matter is that we are already busy enough learning and making new connections to have extra time to work. That being said, there are opportunities such as work study which allow you to make a little bit of cash and sometimes allow you to study on the job. I think this is much different from part time work, in which you must focus your attention solely on the task at hand and have no room to keep up with schoolwork.
