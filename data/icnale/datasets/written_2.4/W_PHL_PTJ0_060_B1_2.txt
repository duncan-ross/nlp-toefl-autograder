A part time job is something that you don't do full time, it is something that you do during your spare time to either earn money or to gain experience for your future profession. Part time jobs are very essential and helpful to everybody because it does function as your source of income but also a source of experience that you could use in the future. People who commonly apply for part-time jobs are college students. They apply for part time jobs for an internship about their major program. College students take internships because it gives them a feel of the world that they would soon enter after their graduation. Their internship also gives them a chance of being absorbed by the company that they applied. Another reason why college students apply for part-time jobs is that they need a source of income to pay for their college education. As a first-year college student, I myself want to apply for a part-time job because I want to have field experience in my major program which is Architecture. I believe that with the experience that I would get from my part-time job I could perform better in school because I would have corporate knowledge and experience of the things that school would not teach.
