With the time going on, there will be more and more college graduates. Obviously, the press of job-hunting is heavier and heavier. For various reasons, many students are looking for part-time jobs. For one thing, it's a good way to get experience of work before get a formal job, for another, part-time job can reduce their financial stress. In my opinion, it's important for us students to find a part-time job. Of course, there will be some disadvantages, but I believe that, there will be more advantages. First of all, we can get many things from part-time job that you can never learn in any classes given by your tutor. Doing a job, it tells you how to communicate with others, even including people you never know before; it tells you how to spend your time wisely, you have much homework to do, you have an important meeting to attend, and, you have to work as a tutor in someone's home every night. Yes, lots of work, endless work. Now you should learning to make a balance between study and part-time job. Secondly, it benefits you a lot when you are trying to communicate with strangers. Through the whole process, you will gradually know how to use your eye contact and body language, you know, these are very important skills if you want to get well with others, especially with strangers. Surely, having a part-time job can set the stage for entering the society. Last, but I don't think it's of much significance. Having a part-time job can earn you some money, to reduce financial stress. All in all, I strongly agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job.
