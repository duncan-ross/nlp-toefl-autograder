I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons which support this idea. First of all, it is very disgusting for other persons in the restaurant. If there is only one person who feels annoyed by the smoking, smoking should be banned. Because smoking is actually harmful neighbor's health, it is dealt with more strictly. For example, in the Singapore, smoking is punished very hardly, because they think it has the possibilities to make other persons health badly. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants makes the atmosphere in the place very awful. The restaurant is the place where people eat the food, and for that reasons, people pay money for the restaurant. Then, is there anyone who eats the food in the dirty atmosphere? To make eating environment clean, all the things in the restaurant should be arranged well. The person who visits the restaurant has the right to expect clean eating environment. In conclusion, I think that smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country, because not only it is very disgusting for people who are not smoking, but also restaurants are the place where people have to eat food in the fresh atmosphere.
