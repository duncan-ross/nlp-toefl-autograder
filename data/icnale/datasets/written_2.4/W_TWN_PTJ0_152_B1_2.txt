It is really important for college students to have a part-time job, because we can learn a lot of things that we can't learn in school. First, we can realize that making money is not easy. We know how hard we got the money, therefore we won't waste it. I almost burst into tears when I first time got my wage. Second, we will get different experience from school. When we are in campus, our teachers can forgive our mistakes easily. Our parents seldom blame us for serious mistakes. However, when we have a part-time job, we need to take responsibility by ourselves. We need to be careful to make too much mistakes, because our boss need someone who can really help him to earn money. When we step in the real society, we can know the cruelty of it. Third, I think doing a good part-time job can help us to discover our real interests. Maybe we want to enter a field of work, and actually we can't know the details from school. I think it will be a good opportunity to do a part-time job which is much similar to the field. By doing the part-time job, we can actually know the work. No matter we finally love it or not, we had a change to realize the work at least. I think doing a part-time job is helpful for us to choose our future full-time work.
