As we all know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. No smoking has become a dream of many people. Some businesses now say that no one can smoke cigarettes in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea though it takes away some of our freedom. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of In public places, the harm of smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous off into the air. Therefore, the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are strongly supporting it. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. What's more, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will surely be beneficial to all of us.
