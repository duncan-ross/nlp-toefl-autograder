I think that smoking should not only be banned all the restaurants in Japan but also in all the restaurants everywhere in the world. Smoking is a leading cause of cancer in people under 50, and smoking causes tar to build up in the lungs. This means that people who smoke cannot perform in athletic activities or have as much energy as people who keep their longs in their bodies healthy. Smoking also takes years away from your lifetime, and I have heard that every cigarette you smoke can shorten your life by as much as 7 minutes. This doesn't seem like a lot, but if you smoke one pack of cigarettes every day, you take nearly 2 hours off your life every day, and if you continue this for a whole year, you will have shortened your life by approximately one month. With these numbers, I think it is easy to see that it is a good choice to quit smoking. By banning smoking in restaurants, and by banning smoking in restaurants in Japan, we can promote the good health of people, and we can teach our children healthier habits and styles of living. For these reasons, I think it is a good idea to ban smoking at restaurants in Japan.
