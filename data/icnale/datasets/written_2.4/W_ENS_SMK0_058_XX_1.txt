Smoking should be banned at restaurants. I work at a restaurant, and as fate would have it smoking was banned only one year ago while I was still working there. Since this change occurred, our restaurant has become much cleaner. We have a piano in our restaurant, and since smoking has been banned, the piano does not need to be tuned as frequently, which is actually quite terrifying because if the air was so dirty that it would cause a piano to go out of tune, I really hope that my own body has not gone out of tune. Also, my bosses told me that since smoking was banned business has actually increased. I'm not sure I fully understand the reasons for this, but he told me that more families are visiting because our restaurants as a good image in the town now. When families go to restaurants, they usually spend around $50 or $60 for a family of four. On the other hand, when smokers go to a restaurant they usually only go by themselves or with one friend, in that is only about $30. The math certainly makes sense, and it shows that even if only the same number of families comes as smokers, we can almost double our profits.
