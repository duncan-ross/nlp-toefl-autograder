Smoking is something that is rather common in the local community. Despite it being very expensive in Singapore to smoke, many people still do smoke. Many are aware of it being detrimental to health, and yet at the same time, people engage in what is called temporal discounting, sacrificing future gains for temporary gains. Despite there being pictures to warn people of smoking effects, people simply continue to do so. Thus, it would seem logical that one should simply ban smoking since increasing prices and scaring the people with health messages do not seem to work. However, I disagree that smoking should be banned as it is one of the only drugs available in the country. If smoking is banned, people would sense that the state is being overly controlling and as a result, it is not unlikely that they would turn to try other forms of drugs. There is still a drug problem locally and smoking is the lesser of the evils. Moreover, Singapore has made it difficult for people to smoke by keeping smoke out of areas where there are other people who do not smoke. Keeping in mind the greater tradeoffs of risking people experimenting with other drugs to replace smoking it was banned, it would simply not seem to be worth it as currently people seem able to comply with the strict regulations Singapore has set to protect the public. One may argue that the protection is not perfect and that people who inhale second-hand smoke would be harmed. However, the tradeoff of having drugs being more rampant posts more danger.
