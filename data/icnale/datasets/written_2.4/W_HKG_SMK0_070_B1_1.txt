There is an urgent need for the government to ban smoking in all restaurants. Restaurants are public places which needed by everyone including children. As many surveys point out that the little body, brain and organs of a child are still in developing which can be affected by the second-hand smoke seriously. In such a little place in the restaurant, the smoke will not get away easily. Therefore, the smell of smoke will remain for a long period of time. Worse still, it is a terribly horrible crisis for the pregnant. Every mother wants to have a healthy baby. If the government does not give a helping hand to banning smoking, all the restaurant will not take a step on it on the grounds that they have no right to refrain the customer from smoking. Also, the owner of restaurant may ignore the hard feeling of children and pregnant thanks to the income from smokers. Banning smoking is good for all the owners and customer if the government separate a small smoking area. For those who want to smoke can smoke in their own area after the meal. For those who do not smoke can have a healthy, tasty and delicious meal.
