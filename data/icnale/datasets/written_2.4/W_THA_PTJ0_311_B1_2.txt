I agree that students should have a part-time job. A part-time job is becoming necessary in student's life. However, Most college students in Thailand don't have a part-time job. I think that the college students should collect experience, even in a position that is not directly related to their field of study. The part-time job will give them much benefit such as experience, co-workers, ability to learn new skills. They will have the basic which make a good employee. They will better prepare themselves for the future. I believe that the students who work are more confident better time-management skills than students who aren't not employed. Working teaches them about responsibility too. Moreover, the college students who have a part-time job can find extra money. They needn't annoy their parents. However, those students can lead to drop out or have low grades. And working can also limit opportunities to build friendships and emotional development. Someone tells the college students should spend time on homework, studies, activities. Besides money which they find will use up with cars, gas and luxurious items because they have money to spend, they feel that they deserve to spend it. However, I still agree that students should have a part-time job. The problems don't happen if they have responsible.
