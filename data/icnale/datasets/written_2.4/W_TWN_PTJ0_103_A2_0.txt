I strongly agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, college students attend classes, go to some contests, and join school clubs, have meals with friends and freely do what they interest in. Time and money are never on their trouble list. However every activity is in campus, the safe and warm environment. There is no one stand in front of students and teach us what is going on in the world, what we will face in the future after graduation, how we can plan our life and prepare for our careers. Hence having a part time could give us a chance to notice those important things and think seriously. Work for someone else not only helps us earn pocket money but also let us know more about ourselves. When I doing the work, I would know if I like this kind job and if the job fits my personalities. When doing the work, I would know more people from other places and have more friends who have different backgrounds. After working, I would start thinking about what I learn from the job; think about my goals and my dreams. It is essential for students to have a part time job to see the world where we live and open our mind.
