Nowadays, there exist a great number of college students doing part-time job during their free time. Some are for experience, and the others are for money actually. For me, my mother doesn't allow me to do that, she emphasizes again and again, 'we can provide you with absolutely enough money for, and just fix all of yourself on your major and your activities!' While I don't agree with this and I really want to do part-time job after class. As far as I concerned, to begin with, it is strong tendency that college students kill their free time by hanging on internet, so having part-time job to do can make us more active and make full use of our campus life. What's more, in my opinion, social life and campus life are totally different. A part-time job can be a real and convenient way for us to touch the society while in campus, which avoids us being too puzzled and frustrated after graduating. Last but not the least, little is better than nothing. We will gain some money more or less so that we can treat ourselves while enjoying the satisfactory. So I agree it a pretty good idea to have a part-time job when in college.
