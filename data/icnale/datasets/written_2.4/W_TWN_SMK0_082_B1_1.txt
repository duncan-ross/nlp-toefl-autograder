'No Smoking" is a common slogan. However, one- fifth people have habits to smoke. The government sets many policies to prohibit people smoke. They raise price and stop smoking in the public place. Our government hopes us keep away from smoking and wants to reduce carbon oxygen. Most people know smoking is a killer, but smokers cannot get out of it. They cannot stand without it. Some smokers share me their experience. When they smoke, they feel cool and forget pressure shortly. Nevertheless, it just cut down relation in short time. When they go back to the real world, they feel upset. That is why they need to smoke many times in a day. If we can make them full in their mind, maybe they will not need to choose to smoke. Provided they can share something bad to their friends, they do not need to smoke. Not only they can spend less money, but they can have a more healthy life. Smoking has many negative influences so people should build a good thinking. When smokers ask non-smokers to join them, we cannot say yes. Because we do it once, then we will do it twice. The best way we do is keep away from smoking forever, not just a slogan.
