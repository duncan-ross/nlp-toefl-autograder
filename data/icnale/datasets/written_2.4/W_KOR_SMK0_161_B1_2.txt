We have two opinions about smoking. Agree about smoking and disagree about it. First, I want to tell about disagree opinion. Because I am not smoking. Smoking is harmful our health. But lots of non-smokers are feeling pain cause of cigarette's smoke. Everybody knows second-hand smoking is more harmful than smokers. If you smoke long time, you can die earlier than non-smoker. And nowadays lots of people try to help for smoker to quit cigarette. They try to give free chance of quit smoking. For example, give free nonsmoking patch and some pill which help to control about feeling of smoking. And on TV has lots of advertisement about danger of smoking. So if smokers who want to quit cigarette, but it if too difficult quit by ownself, try to get some help. Nevertheless you want to smoke; I want to smoke only on smoking area. And second opinion is agreed about smoking. Almost of smokers are say we want to smoke. But these days we can smoke only our house. Because almost of area are nonsmoking building. My opinion is disagreeing smoking. But when I read some article about smoker's difficulties, I can understand little. In government, they sell cigarettes. But government wants to quit smoking. This is out of question. If government and people really want to get rid of smokers, they cannot sell cigarette. So I think if you really want to get rid of smokers, never sell a cigarette and if you can do it, just you make some smoking for smoker.
