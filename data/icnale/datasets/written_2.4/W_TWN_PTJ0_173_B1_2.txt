Students with part-time job even can save some money and use them to fulfill their dreams. Also, it can help students to get more social experiences, keep interpersonal relationship and explore personal interests.

If someone do not have adequate time control ability or get too much working hours than one can handle, it might affect studies in college even causing being flunked, out of school. If student consider part-time job is much more important than studies, they may lose something important. Besides, Tiredness cause by too much work might harm one's health, it also should be pay attention. To sum up, part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. Either it benefits your life or not depends on whether a student can balance it with studies well. Basically, I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Life should full of challenges and possibility, and part-time job is another way to broad one's horizons.
