I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As you can see, many students in college do part-time jobs, and what the real feeling of them is that they learned a lot when they do their part-time jobs. College students live in school, in which they can just learn some theories. When they graduate from school, they know little about how to earn their living by themselves. They don't know how to use their knowledge in their work. So, it is important for college student to learn how to face to the individual life. Also, if college students try to do some part-time work, they can also reduce some pressure of their parents. Most of college students are adults, they are supposed to afford their fare in their life. Maybe parents do not want you to do a part-time job because they worry that you will be really tired if you do a extra job when you are busy to studying. But as a adult, college student must learn to balance them. What's more, college students have a lot of spare time, if we do some part-time jobs, our spare time will be full of happiness. And it will urge us to study more efficiently. Because of the reason mentioned above, I think it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job.
