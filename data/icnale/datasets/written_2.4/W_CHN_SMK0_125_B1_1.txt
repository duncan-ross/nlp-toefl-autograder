Nowadays, it is not very uncommon see many people smoke in the restaurants. So people are discussing whether smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Some people think that smoking should not be banned in restaurants because they are smokers themselves. They think smoking help them a lot in many sides. But, in my opinion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. Here I'll give you some reasons of my idea. First of all, smoking is harm to people's health, not only to these smokers but also nonsmokers. Scientists have show that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart trouble, and so on. Smokers feel very happy when smoke after meal in restaurants. But doctors say it is very dangerous if smokers smoke after meal at once. What's worse, the harm to the nonsmokers who breath in the smoke is much serious than smokers. So non-smokers hate people smoke in the restaurants. Second, there are lots of fire accidents being caused by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the rest of cigarette on the ground. It causes fire and terrible disaster. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. If we do this from now on, people will have a safe and clean place to have a good meal and enjoy themselves. Smokers can smoke outside if they want.
