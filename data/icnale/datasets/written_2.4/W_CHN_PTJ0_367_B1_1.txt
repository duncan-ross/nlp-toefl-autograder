After entering the university, more and more students gradually know the tiredness of parents. In order to lighten the burden of parents, they start to look for part-time jobs. Now, part-time job is so popular that very students take it. We can see that a lot of students take part-time jobs. But is it good to students. Someone think taking part-time jobs is good to students. In their opinion, it is a good way for students to be independent. And students can make money by themselves, so they will know the value of money and the tiredness of parents. Lightening the burden of the family is also the benefit of taking part-time jobs. By taking part-time jobs, students will know the difficulty of surviving in the society. Others think students should not take part-time jobs. In their opinion, studying is the most important thing that students should do. Taking part-time jobs will take much time that students should put in study. And, after doing the jobs, students will be so tired that they do not want to study. What is more, the money they make is too less, so it is not worthwhile. In my opinion, students should have a plan. If they have enough time, they can take part-time jobs, because it is a exercise to them. And students can make friends when working. But it is bad for students to take part-time jobs when they do not have enough time. If so, they can not study well
