Not now, not ever. has been antidrug campaign's slogan, but I think it is also suitable for encourage people not to smoking. The Hong Kong government has implemented a policy in order to ban smokers smoke in some restaurants area, but I do think that it is not enough, the policy should apply to all restaurant area. If we improve this policy, this will absolutely encourage more smokers to give up smoking, because they are hardly find a place to smoke, or else they take the risk to pay the punishing payment. Many researches show that smoking badly affect our health. Tar can increase mucus in our trachea, so smokers may always coughing. Also, nicotine will increase the chance of developing a lung cancer. And second-smoke can badly affect a child physical development. So why don't the government do more to encourage the residents not to smoke? Some people may said that we are deducing the human rights of the smokers, but think deeper, do the smokers also deducing our human rights? We do not want to breathe I any smoke that is produced by cigarette, and introducing this policy is for the smokers' health good. We should do more to encourage smokers to get rid of smoking, and let the restaurant be more hygiene!
