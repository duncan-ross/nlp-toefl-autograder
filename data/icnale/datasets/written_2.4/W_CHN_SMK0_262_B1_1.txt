 Is Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country? I think many people who are against smoking will say yes immediately, as smoking have a bad influence on the health of smokers and people sitting beside them and affect their moods as well. But can it be a adequate reason to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. What do the smokers think about? Since they are addicted to smoking, it seems cruel to ban their rights to relax. Despite that as a person always objects smoking in public place, I still do not support the idea above, at least some special places should be set for smoking people, like smoking rooms in railway. In the other aspect, restaurants provide proper places for people communicating with others, therefore, these occasions are quite relaxed. Once smoking being banned at all the restaurants, there surely will be a sharp decrease in the number of customes. All in all, though smoking in public places is impolite, but I still in favor of the idea that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
