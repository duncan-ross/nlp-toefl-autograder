As is known to all, cigarette is popular for many people. So we can see many people are smoking in a public place. This is very harmful for the other people who don't smoke. In addition, the restaurant's atmosphere surely is broken. The survey shows that the more and more people die because of smoking. But many persons are addicted to smoking, and so many persons think that smoking can release them. Hence the affair that government decides to ban smoking right now is very hard to be accepted for them. Therefore, I think the government need to consider it more carefully. In restaurants, smoking is certainly banned. But we still make the people that are addicted to smoking. In the public place, we should establish a room that is permitted to smoking. Of course, smoking is a disputed thing. It can lead to a debate, so government should take it more seriously. In a restaurant, the tidy environment is very important for every one that dines out. So the government must take actions to make the people comfortable in a restaurant, and encourage the persons that addicted to smoking to give up smoking. Just in this way, our society will be harmonious.
