Learning the ropes, on a part-time basis Experience is the best teacher. It makes us grow as a person, and prepares us for the future. For college students, a part time job is a taste of the real world and at the same time, something that can help them support themselves, even when they are still students. Part-time jobs give students a feel of their chosen field. Through this, they would have a smooth transition to their professional career compared to if they are thrust immediately into the lion's den. A part time job helps a college student appreciate the tutelage he underwent in college and to add to that, now he can see how he could apply what he learned through his stay in college. Through part time jobs, college students learn to balance their work with their studies. They gain skills like discipline and time-management, values a classroom won't teach. As a college student, one should be ready for what happens after college too because college is in itself a preparation for the future. Adding extra activities would give the student better training in preparation for the obstacles that the professional world has to offer. When a part time job comes with a salary, the student can use this to support their college education. I've heard of a number of college students who have part time jobs so that they can pay for their college education. Some schools even offer scholarships wherein students will serve time in the school, a sign that even the schools have joined in providing jobs for the students. Part time jobs should be seen as a plus by college students and others alike. Not only do they help prepare students, but they also make the transition from school to work for students easier.
