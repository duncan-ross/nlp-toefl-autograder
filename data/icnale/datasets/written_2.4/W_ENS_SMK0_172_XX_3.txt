At best, I see bans as a band aid fix and am yet to be convinced that they have any positive, long-term value that could not be achieved through the use of decent extraction systems which would negate the need to make smokers feel that they are being ostracised in some way. Having seen the results of bans in the UK and some parts of New York and Boston in the USA, I do not agree that these are the best solution. What they do is further fan the feelings of discontent and persecution amongst smokers and achieve nothing that could not be gained through the effective use of modern technology and without the need for alienating people. I think that governments like Japan need to re-evaluate any research that has led them to the conclusion that introducing bans is the only effective alternative. Furthermore, I don't believe that governments should infringe in the private sector area apart from policing standard law and order policies that are already in place. By doing so, I feel that it creates the impression of a dictatorial style of government rather than that of a democratic entity. Not being familiar with the Constitution of Japan, I cannot comment on whether this might also be viewed as a civil rights issue.
