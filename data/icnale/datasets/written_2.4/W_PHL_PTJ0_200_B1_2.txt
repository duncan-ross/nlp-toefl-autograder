Part time jobs are not an easy task, it can be very tiring but despite of it, it can help you to be mature enough to handle situation in life. Part time job are needed by some people especially since we are facing poverty. Some persons really need to have one (part time job) so that they can live, eat, and survive while schooling and it also help their parents in financial problem/s. One example of this is the people with lack of money or the poor, poor family have no choice, than to push their children to work despite of their young ages because of this, students must balance work and studies and take time for everything. Part time job can have a negative and positive or disadvantage and advantage in a person because part time job is a time. The advantages or the positive aspect of part time jobs, it allows student freedom to make their own money which means they can choose how or when to spend it, it also gives the student responsibility to juggle their time and plan ahead with regards to: school, work, sports (if there are any), friends, family, church (if they go to church), band (if they play an instrument), and it allows them to save up for anything they need or want. And the disadvantaged or the negative aspect of part time job, students could become too busy with work and neglect other responsibilities, student may be tired from work and may not do their best in school, and student may be at work a lot and not have as much time to spend with family and friends.
