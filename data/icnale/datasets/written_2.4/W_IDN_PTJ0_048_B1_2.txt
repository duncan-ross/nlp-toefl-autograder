In this time, many college students already have a job. Actually it is an part time job. Part time job is a Job that have a reduced work time almost half from the normal work time. And the salary its not as much as salary of the full worker job. The salary of the part time worker is about from Rp500. 000(about fifty dollars) to Rp 2. 000. 000, 00 (about two hundred dollars). It can exceed two hundred dollars depends on what part time job do you take and how many hours the job or how difficult the work. I say it was important, because college students can get more experience before he feel the reality world of the business world. College students can feel how hard it takes to make some money, so he become more mature naturally. Part time work can increase students skill ( if the part time job he takes is the same with his major). It can train a skill of managing time from the student. If he take a part time job, the student must arrange his or her part time schedule with his college schedule. So, it will train the college student discipline. That's why I believe part time job is important for college student.
