Smoking is very common nowadays. You see smokers basically everywhere. And restaurants are no exception. We come to restaurants for one thing—food. That is our main goal but not the only thing that matters. There are other factors such as the ambience, service, environment, etc. that adds to a great meal. Now if smoking's allowed in the restaurant's premises and cigarette smoke's everywhere, wouldn't you lose your appetite? Personally, I find cigarette smoke unpleasant. And having to unwillingly smell this foul stench would be aggravating. Most especially if you're in a restaurant trying to have a good meal but is ruined because of the smoke coming from another table. That's why smoking should be banned at all restaurants in our country. It may be hard to do that since there are lots of smokers in the Philippines but it is possible. Smokers have the right to smoke but non smokers also have their rights. The smoke from the cigarette is spread easily thus, non smokers are affected even if they don't want to. Our main purpose in going to a restaurant is to eat. If someone smokes in a restaurant, we will lose our appetite and most probably leave. Now smokers should respect that. There are places designated for smokers and that is where they should smoke and not in a public place where other non smokers can be affected.
