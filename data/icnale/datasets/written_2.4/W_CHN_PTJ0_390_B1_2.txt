Nowadays, with the competition for a job become sharp, more and more college students choose to find a part-time job in order to have a better beginning of their job career. Then, as college students, should we just follow others. No, before we make the decision, we should have a analysis of the part-time job. First of all, let's have a look at its advantages. As we all know, doing a part-time job can develop our ability. More important, we will get precise experience of working which can have a great influence on us. Next one may be the most important one. Before we have a part-time job, we are not a true independent man. Having a part-time job forces us to face the society and to be responsible for what we do. It is a large step in our life. So, there is no doubt that we can have a great development. However, it can have a negative influence at the same time. By doing this, we get experience of working but loss time to study. When we graduate, we can get experience easily but how can we have such a great opportunity to study.

We should seize the opportunity not only to prepare for our job but also to become independent. All we should pay attention to is having a suitable arrangement between study and work. It's time to make the change. Let's do something to put our campus life more wonderful.
