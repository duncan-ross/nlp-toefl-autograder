When I was a small child, I felt curious about why my father like smoking so much. I still remember that my father told me that the cigarettes are to them what the snacks are to us. Sometimes our lives need this kind of eating things to have entertainment. According to this, I hold the opinion that we can't ban the smoking in the restaurant. Indeed, smoking in public sometimes will disturb others and make the air dirty; the restaurant can avoid this by preparing non-smoking area for people to have a cigarette. By doing this, it can easily solve this problem. Although, may some people would say there's no benefit to smoke but harm people's health. Living in a sociable society, you need to know the basic behaviors of how to communicate with others in business or something else. The cigarettes as a tool contribute more on the process. Of course it's hard to avoid having cigarettes in a restaurant. Finally I also want to emphasis that people should smoke in a suitable way. After all health is the most important thing in your life. Not smoke too much for the sake of your health. I am not appreciating the opinion that we should ban the smoking in the restaurant. Instead, I would prefer having a smoking area.
