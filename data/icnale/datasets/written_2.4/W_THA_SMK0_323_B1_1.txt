In Thai society, many people smoke at any areas. In some countries, there are some restaurants that they do not allow people to smoke because it is illegal. People are happy when they can smoke because it is their right to do like that. There are three reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Second, I don't agree with smoking that completely banned because I think it is people's right to smoke in the public areas like restaurant. In some countries, governments ban this action because they think that it is impolite and harm others. Therefore, I don't want them to ban this behavior because it might violate against the UN Human right declaration. Third, wanting to ban smoking in public places isn't about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with.
