Cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health. That is the most common advert people see when watching cigarette commercials. But those damn TV commercial bastards fail to add that it's even more dangerous for the people around you. Smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the country. Not only that, but in every public place as well. Think of every bacterium you know, and imagine inhaling them with your nose, inside your body. Gross, isn't it? That's the exact same thing with smoking. You inhale the smoke, it's irritating, suffocating and it's deadly. Now imagine being indoors, say, a restaurant for example, and ten or fifteen people blowing out smoke from their mouths. The waiter who brings you your well-cooked meal walks through the smoke. Particles of it get on your food. Then you eat it. It doesn't affect your in that exact moment, but it eventually takes its toll on your body. Now those government officials who plan to do something about it have my support. I mean, who doesn't want clean air? Obviously, the people who don't want clean air are smokers. If they want to die a slow, painful death, it's their choice. But those of us who don't should be saved from those who do.
