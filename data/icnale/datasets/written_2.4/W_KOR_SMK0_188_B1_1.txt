Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I completely agree this opinion. There are three reasons; I completely agree this topic B. First, these days, smoker can smoke anywhere they want. They don't think another person. In the restaurant, if they smoke, another person breathes some cigarette smoke. That means, in the restaurant, we don't eat a food. We do passive smoking. If there are children or old people in the restaurant, this is fatal effect, but restaurants don't have a rule for banning the smoking. Second, restaurant is not smoking room; it is food serving place and important time for guest themselves. However, in the country, there is no law to ban at the restaurant usually. If they have a rule, this rule doesn't have a power. And if the county makes a rule for banning all places' smoking, smokers will argue their right. Therefore, the country makes a public advertisement for bed effect to smoke in the restaurant or other place, and smokers will accept this rule. This is job for country. Third, smoking also effect smokers directly. I don't know why smokers smoke to eat a food. If they really think their health, future and dream, and another restaurant guest, they have to agree this opinion at least. In my opinion, smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is good thing for restaurant guests and smokers. Plus, another place also banned smoking. For example, library, cafe, school, pub etc.
