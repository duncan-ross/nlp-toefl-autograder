When it comes to smoking banning, quite a lot of people will support this policy because smoking is not about a problem of personal habits but a public concern. Though enjoyable as smoking is for smokers, the behavior of smoking is unpleasing in public. It will discomfort people near you. Everyone should be considerate about others. It is reported that the annual number of people killed by smoking is increasing. And now not only man but also women smoke a lot. This trend will have an bad impact on the health of our future generation. Moreover, smoking in public is more dangerous. Second hand smoke is really bad for other people whose rate of lung disease will be higher than smokes themselves. It is un moral and these smokers can't take the responsibility. So, from the health point of view, smoking is absolutely harmful to human and therefore must be banned especially in public places such as restaurants. Environmentally, smoking cause pollution. The situation of air is getting more and more worse. Both people and nature will be suffering. We should publish a standard of monitoring environmental equality in large cities to avoid more air pollution. It is time we tighten great control over smoking banning in public places and strictly deal with the polluted environment and treat the pollution.
