As we all know, smoking is bad for our health. So some people choose not to smoke. But sometimes even non-smokers are forced to smoke. Yes, that is second hand smoking. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because restaurant is a public place. Most people are for the ban. So am I, and I think it a wise choice. Smoking will do harm to smoker's lungs and cause many diseases such as heart attack and even lung cancer. What's worse, passive smoking may cause worse effects. So smoking in public places is irresponsible to both smokers and people around. For each other's health concerns, smoking should be banned in restaurants. Though most people agree with it, when it comes to exercise, some people still act negatively. Some think it as unpractical because smoking people occupies most of the customers and it is equally important to protect smokers' freedom. But I think starting it from now on is wiser because it makes no sense to leave it alone until the problem become much worse. The government should try to set some regulations that all the restaurant ban people from smoking inside of the restaurant. If they really want to smoke, they can go outside of the restaurant to smoke and it won't influence others.
