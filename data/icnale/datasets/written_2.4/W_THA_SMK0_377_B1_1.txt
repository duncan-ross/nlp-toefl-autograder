"Do not smoke in this area" we often saw the message about this in every public place. For example in hospitals, schools, Univesity, resturants etc. It is a good banner way to stop the person who usually smoke in public area. I think the place that should be banned smoking is restaurants. Because it is a place that many people go there for relaxed. For example the older people, childent etc. the owner of erery restaurants should be taking care about this. This essay I would like to disscuse about should be banned smoke in restaurants or not. The restaurants is a public plase the everyone usually go ther. It dose not good if some person smoking in restaurants durring another people are eating food. Some people think restaurants is a relaxed place, everyone can do everything we want. But I think smoking in restaurants is a bad behavior. The person who smoke should be in smoking area. It is better than inside restaurants. Some restaurants also self cigarette for the customer. That way some people often smoke in restaurants that they have to go. The owen should pay respected with law banned smoking. If in the restaurants have no smoking area I think the owner should control the guest that want to smoke to go out side. because some women allergiy the tobacco smoke. Everyone will be happy and enjoy eating if the restaurant wihtout tobacco smoke. The restaurants owner should be serious about this. Because it is a service job and the customer go there for spending their relaxed time.
