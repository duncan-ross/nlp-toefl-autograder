With the development of society, smoking in public place such as restaurant is abandoned in many countries. Even though, it can give great inconvenience to smokers, since non-smokers suffer from their smoking, I am strongly convinced that those who smoke in the restaurants should be banned. First, smoking harms not only smokers' health, but also non-smokers'. It is a well known fact that passive smoking damages a person's body more than the direct one does. People who are near the smoker in the restaurant have no choice but to breathe all the bad chemical substances not being filtered. It causes many diseases such as cancers and difficulty in breathing. No one wants to harmful their health, with eating delicious food. Furthermore, the family who has a baby does never want to breathe in really harmful smoke to their baby. They have to take care of him because of young age. Second, everyone has the right to enjoy their life. A number of people visit restaurant to eat delicious food and have good time with their family or friends. Since they pay the money including service money, they have the rights to enjoy the happiness and even freedom. However, if a person smokes in the restaurant, this means that the person is violating the non-smokers' rights to refuse to breathe in the smoke, which harms their bodies and makes them unpleasant with the smell. For the two reasons above, I agree with the rule that prohibits people from smoking at the all restaurants in the country.
