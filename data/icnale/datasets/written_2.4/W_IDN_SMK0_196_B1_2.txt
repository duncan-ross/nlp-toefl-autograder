Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. I am agree with this statement. We know in the cigarette there is many addictive material which one can made many diseases for our body. Smoking in public area not only danger for our smoker but also many people around them. Beside that, can make our lungs has many hole. Smoking is a tradition not only for Indonesian's people but also people in the world. I don't know why they have a bad daily activity like that. It is a government's homework about how to handling smokers to smoking in special area. If you smoking in public area it like you kill people around you. Because cigarette can make many disease and make a pollution. If you smoke in the restaurant, can make all of food can be contamination. Beside that, cigarette is a biggest donate for our country. If smoking should be banned, so this country has less income. If a cigarette factory is closed, society around that haven't a job. The cigarette factory must make some activity with our society for save our earth, for example plant the tree, clean up the garbage in the river and the sea, etc. So, the cigarette factory not only produce the cigarette but also save the earth. So smoking in the restaurant should be banned, the owner of the restaurant make a special area for all of smoker. So, at now smoker must stop smoking can be spent your money to benefit thing and make the air free pollution. So far as we know, now is global warming, we must save the earth from pollution. Because we know that if the earth has broken cause pollution, etc.
