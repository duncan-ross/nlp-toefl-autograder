I believe that to have a part-time job is important to college students for two reasons. First of all, a part-time job can enable college students to become an adult for some aspects including a financial thing. So far, most Korean students are totally supported by their parents for every thing including pocket money. As we become a college student, however, we need to earn money by doing a part-time job for pocket money at least. Because, to be a college student would mean an adult, students need to be independent and responsible for themselves. In addition, if they earn money, they would develop their thoughts and one of them would be an importance of money. This would prevent many students from wasting their money and make them use money relatively wisely. That is, a part-time job would be a process of an awareness for the value of labor and money and therefore, make college students sound adults. Second, a part-time job can broaden a prospect in experiences of college students. As most people know, there are many jobs including a part-time job. To be specific, students could work at a cafeteria or a shop. Through a part-time job, students could get valuable experiences as well as money from it. Moreover, if a part time job is related to what they major in college, they could advantage and exhibit their merits. With regard to experience, students could meet various people and make a personal exchange. Unlike school days in past, the range students face through a part-time job would be vast. This would be precious and could be helpful for a job or a life later. Therefore, a part-time job would be a meaningful social experience for college students.
