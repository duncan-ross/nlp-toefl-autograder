Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? In my opinion I think it should be that because smoking leads to many health problems such as lung cancer and many problems about lung. The disease occurs because in the cigarette has a Tar, Nicotine which is a "Cacinogen" (substance that leads to cancer). However, I will not talk about the person who usually smokes because they also surely know that what will happen with their health in the future when they decide to smoke. On the other way I will talk about the person who does not smoke but is affected by smoking because of smoking in public such as restaurants, subway station, bus stop, taxi stand or something like that. I think the government should aware about this problem because people who do not smoke are affected although they do not smoke but they just stand in wrong place and wrong time. So the national rate of people who die with lung cancer or lung disease is increasing in nowadays. To solve this problem I think the government should write the law of smoking and strict with it. In order to decrease the national rate of people who die with lung cancer or lung disease.
