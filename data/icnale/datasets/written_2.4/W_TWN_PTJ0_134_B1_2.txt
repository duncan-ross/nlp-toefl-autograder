I do not agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many college students with one or more part-time job. Although it is beneficial in a variety way to have working experience during campus life, but it is not so crucial for every college students. Being a college student, I have some friends working as a part-timer. Some of them can give consideration to the both side, but some failed. I think it is more important to work hard on schoolwork than on part-time work. I have even heard that some college students skip classes to go to their part-time, which is obviously overlooking their study. Here is another reason why I do not regard having a part-time job is significant to college students. There is much more experience we could go through except part-time jobs in our college, and once if we miss them, we are less likely to have another chance after we graduated. For example, we can go to student clubs, or be a volunteer in a charity. We can learn many things when we participate in those groups. Based on these reasons above, I think we should plan our college life with more concern; if we have chances to enrich our life in college, why bother spending our precious time working on part-time jobs?
