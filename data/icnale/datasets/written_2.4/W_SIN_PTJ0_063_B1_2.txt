In my opinion, holding a part time job also the student to gain experience in the working world, as well as using the money obtained to use as extra pocket money to use, save or pay off tuition debts. I think that working while studying is an invaluable experience because first, a certain amount of working experience may translate into an added advantage when it comes to looking for jobs after graduation. This is because some employers will prefer to employ students who already have prior job experience. Also, working while studying allows the student to use his spare time to make extra money. The money earned can be used for many purposes. Especially in Singapore, where most students studying in university are paying school fees via loans, working now allows them to save up some money before they graduate, and the money can be used to repay the schools fees before the interest starts to snowball. However, working alongside studying requires very good time management, which not many students may be able to handle. Having a part time job effectively means an additional commitment, one that cannot be ignored at whim. Coupled with the extra-curricular activities in school and schoolwork, the burden may be too heavy to bear for the student. Also, the time consumed by working means that the student now has less time for other activities, be it studying or socializing. For many, university is the last phase of education, and it may seem pointless to work while in school since working is going to be an integral part of life after graduation. Weighing the pros and cons of working part time, I believe that ultimately, if one is able manage his time properly, the detriments can be easily mitigated.
