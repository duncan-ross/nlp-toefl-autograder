To begin with, I disagree with this statement, because we must look around the design of the restaurant. If it is in the outdoor, we should not to banned the smokers, than if it in the indoor with air conditioner inside, the smokers must be respect to other guest and smoking at the outside. But, there is many restaurant in Indonesia that the design is indoor with air conditioner inside the room, but there is a sign "smoking room" that means that room is free to smokers to smoking. But, maybe I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country, because must be there is special room to smoking like smoking room and there is a sign that not able to smoking to this room, so the smokers that wants to smoking will not smoking in there but in the smoking room. At least smoking is not good to our health, smoking is can make our lung broken, smoking can cause many diseases an makes heart attack, impotency. It can make passive smokers feel dizzy and not comfort to eat in that restaurant. The smoke of the cigarettes is not good for the people in the restaurant who are enjoying their meals. From the reason above, smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country.
