It is important for college students to have a part-job in my eyes. As you know, nowadays students in college almost are the 90s. They are almost born in a peaceful and wealthy family. However, the stabilized living circumstance makes their lazy and irresponsible. So when they are now in school, they are always staying in their living room and never go out for one step, which is called otaku by society. They don't want to take a part-job, neither. As far as I am concerned, there are some students taking a part-job, who are almost come from a relatively "poor" family, such as me. Taking a part-job is important for us, because it can give a sum of money, which though not large, can loosen our parents' pressure and make us feel comfortable when we think our parents won't live in a tense life. Maybe it is not important for some students. In my eyes, except a small income, there is an important reason to take a part-job in college. Now I have been taking two part-jobs, where I find much happiness. In the team, I have made many friends. We together work, and live. During our teamwork, I learned how to be a good teammate and how to cooperate with others in a task. I love my part-job and love my teammates. It is important to take a part-job.
