For long has smoking been a disputable social problem, and I think it's high time that we draw a conclusion and take action towards it. I agree to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country for the following reasons. First, smoking has nowadays become one of the most serious pollutions. In China, about 3/4 of population is found out to be the victim of second-hand smoke. And when we find out that the rest 1/4 is who that smokes, we have to acknowledge the dangerous situation we are faced with, that is, there is the toxic gas form cigarettes in every home. Can we just stand here and see this going on? No! Second, public places can be easily polluted by smoke. So it's reasonable that we first take step to protect these places form smoke. We eat in restaurant everyday, and we definitely don't want the disgusting smoke to ruin our appetite while enjoying the delicious food. Think about it, you step into a restaurant and expect to enjoy a good meal but only to find the whole room filled with smokes, what a bad day! Last but not least, kids are most easily to be harmed by smokes. Will you want you child to be exposed to the toxic gases? So let's take action and make our world a better place!
