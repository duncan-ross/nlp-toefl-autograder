Work in a part time for college students is important. I agree with this statement, because I think it is very good for college student to practice to make a business or entrepreneurship. Besides that, there are many other reasons why to have a part time job is very important for college students is very important. Although college students are very busy with their study, but they still can doing a good activities like working in a part time. They can working in the restaurant, coffeshop, bookstore, minimarket, and in other places. Usually, working in a part time at 9 am until 3 pm or at 3 pm until 10 pm. So I think this activity is will not disturb their study process in the college. But, it can maked an activity before study or after study in the college. Most of people certainly often think that every college student is very busy with their study in the college. But I think if they can manage their time carefully, working in a part time is not impossible. And I think is it can managed carefully it's can't disturb their study and their study achievement. Because every things is depend of how individual to manage their time. There are many advantages of work in a part time for college students. For example, if they work in a part time they can increase their money so they can help their parents too. And then they can also pay the boarding house with their money from work in a part time, buying food, and others. Besides that, this activity is very important to practices become a good entrepreneur, businessmen, and many others work if the students graduate from their college.
