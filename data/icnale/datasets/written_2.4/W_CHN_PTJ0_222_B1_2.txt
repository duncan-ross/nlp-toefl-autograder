 We are no longer freshmen in college now. There are more chances for us to do something like part time job. But whether part time job is important for us college students ? In my view, part time job is important for us. We can benefit a lot from it. First, we can learn how to communicate with different people, which will be helpful to develop our social ability that is necessary for jobs. Second, it can bring us one more skill if we take part in it. No matter what the part time job is, we have to know how to make it moving. During the process that we try it, a new skill will be owned by us. Third, of course, we can make some money by doing this. Maybe the money we make is not so much, but we make the money only by ourselves rather than get from our parents. To some degree, we can share our parents' burden somewhat. All of these can identify the important of part time job. As for me, I have a part time job. From the job, I have learnt how hard it is to make money. I also make my ability improved. Many classmates of mine who have part time jobs have the same feelings as well. In a word, we need a part time job.
