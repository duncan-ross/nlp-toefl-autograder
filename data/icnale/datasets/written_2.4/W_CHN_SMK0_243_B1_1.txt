As is known to all that smoking does a lot of harms to our health. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? It remains to be discussed. In my opinion, smoking can't be banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking is a long-overdue question which is undoubtedly can't be solved in a short period of time. It is estimated that there thousands of people who are hooked on cigarette and the number becomes larger every year. If we ban smoking in all restaurants, these smokers can not dine out any more. What's more, we can't promise that these people will all quit smoke. Maybe they will get mad, maybe their family will broke for their not dining out with their family members. Lots of problems which we didn't expect will exist. Society will be in a mass. Last but not the least, it is not the only way to protect most people's health. Restaurants can set smoking region for people who smoke and it will meet all guests' demand. At large, Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for it is not a necessity and will bring unexpected problems.
