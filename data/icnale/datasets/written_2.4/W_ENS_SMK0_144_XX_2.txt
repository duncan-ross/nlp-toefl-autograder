I agree but would also add that smoking should be banned in all public places in Japan. The reasons for the ban are obvious to all and should not be up for discussion. Apart from the nuisance value, passive smoking causes just as many health issues as smoking directly does. There is more than enough support for such a ban and momentum is growing everyday to introduce a smoking ban for all public places. This issue has been debated backwards and forwards in many countries and I am certain that it has been discussed in Japanese Government circle on more than one occasion. The time for discussion is over and it is now time for serious action irrespective of the feeble arguments put forward by the smoking community. There is no question that smoking kills and that inhaling second-hand smoke (passive smoking) also kills. The onus is on the Japanese Government to introduce a ban and also to enforce the ban across the nation. If this means also introducing some form of financial penalty for businesses that do not comply with the ban, then the government should also be prepared for this and act swiftly by imposing a substantial fine immediately in order to deter others from flaunting the ban.
