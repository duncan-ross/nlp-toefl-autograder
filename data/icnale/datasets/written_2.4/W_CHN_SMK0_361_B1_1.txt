Believe it or not, smoking has become more and more common in our lives. Nobody can deny that we can see it anytime or anywhere. Smokers believe strongly that when they feel tired or upset, a cigarette can certainly help them forget them and gain happiness and energy. Of course, we cannot easily condemn that they are wrong, just because it is unhealthy. But I want to declare that maybe we should consider others' feelings when we enjoy ourselves, especially when we in public. So, in my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public. In order to keep healthy, not only for others but also for smokers, we really need a law to tell people that smoking in public is impolite. We should try our best to let smokers know that this kind of practice is harmful to everybody. Anyhow, smoking in public is such a bad thing that can only indicate the smoker is a indelicacy person. Of course, we all know quit smoking is such a difficult thing for everybody and forcing smokers not to smoke is also unreasonable. How can we solve this problem? Maybe we can establish some places where smokers can enjoy themselves without any worry! Smoking is bad for our health, and smoking in public is a bad symbol of our soul. At last, I want to say respecting others is respecting ourselves !
