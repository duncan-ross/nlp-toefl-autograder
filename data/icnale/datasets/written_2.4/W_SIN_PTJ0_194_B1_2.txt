It is important for college students to hold part-time jobs. Firstly, I will discuss the benefits of managing both schoolwork and part-time job concurrently. This means careful allocation of time between the student's studies, his or her part-time job as well as family and social life. A student who successfully manages to strike a balance between the above will gain invaluable time-management skills which is an essential tool useful when he or she embarks on further studies, career and when he or she start a family. Holding a part-time job, whether or not during school term or off-school period, teaches a student several other important lessons too. One, it teaches them that things do not come easily or the way a person wants it to go. This means that they will learn not to take what their parents provide for them for granted such as the value of money. Two, they will have a taste of independence in the sense that they are earning some pocket money on their own. That means they will have to work hard to earn for the things they desire. Three, working part-time often offer fresh insights on a lot of issues hence students who work part-time are often more mature than their peers. However, having a part-time job does have its disadvantages. Holding a part-time job while studying often means that something else has got to give way, be it schoolwork, parents or friends. Young people often lack the ability to manage time well and in the process of acquiring such ability, they often learn the lesson the hard way such as subpar school grades. In conclusion, there are merits and shortcomings to having a part-time job but it depends on the motivation for one to work while studying. More often than not, they are forced into it by circumstances such as to supplement the family's low household income.
