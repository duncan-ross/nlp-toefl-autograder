Now part time job is one of the undivided part of college students. Many of college student take the part time job. They have so many reason to do the part time job. Some said that they want to be independent, not depend to their parents, especially to fulfill their needs in college. Some said that they want to have work experiences before they must work after graduation. In my personal opinion as a college student, what we must think first is our duty as a student. There are many of my friend that can't handle their duty as a college student. When they got income, they suddenly forget about their college. And it's affect to their scores, late to graduate, and spend a lot money. Most of them forget about their duty as a college student. But, am I really say that college student not allow to do part time job ? of course not. As I wrote above part time job also have benefits to the college student, work experience, become independent, etc. which is good. Part time job is also good solution for students that don't have enough money from their parents. But everything must in balance. We must know our duty first, as college student, so no question that you must do your task as college student very well. You can use part job as your advantage but not the most important. Do not let the trend to do part time job among your friends make you doubt, struggle, and in the end you'll make wrong decision.
