I would agree to a certain extent with the statement that college students should have a part-time job. Being a current college student myself, I find that it is important to acquire some life skills and experience having reached the age where adulthood is imminent. Personally, having worked part-time at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, a renowned institution offering arts education to tertiary students, my experience has allowed me to handle different situations with different types of people. This is something where one cannot learn off from a textbook. However, the context of when which the college student is holding a part-time job hold equal significance as well. The period of time when college students are having their holiday is actually a good time for students to hold part-time jobs. However, it may not be as beneficial for the student during term period. In my opinion, the job of a college student should be to study first and foremost in order to be able to obtain good grades. However, the diversion caused by having a part-time job may affect the attention that students are affording to their students. As such, I believe that having a part-time job is necessary for the long-term, provided that it is being carried out at the right time.
