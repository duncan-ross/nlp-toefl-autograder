In my opinion, it is important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons which support my point of view are as follow. To start with, having a part-time job can help students to improve their time management skill. Since college students are all adult, it is vital for them to learn how to maintain balance between study and work. I believe none of the future employers would like to employ anybody who has trouble with their schedule. Getting a part-time job, students can be partially financial independent from their family. It is a good idea for students to share the financial burden for their families. They should show their responsibilities to their families, and this is the way they can be more mature and responsible. In addition, students can learn some soft skills such as communication skill during the time they are doing the part-time jobs, which cannot be learnt from any textbooks or from schools. Some may argue that if students are getting a part-time job, they may lose their relaxation time or time to be with their friends and family. However, there are two faces of a coin; scarification is a must when you want to have both things done. That is the reason why time management is one of the important skills students should learn from the job. To conclude, it is a wonderful idea of college students getting a part-time job as they can gain a lot from it no matter soft skills or personal development.
