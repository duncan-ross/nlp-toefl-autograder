When I go to the restaurant, I always face the problem of smoking from people sit near my table. I don't like the smokers so much. I think that the government should ban people from smoking in the community. When I go to the park or the shopping mall, I always come across many smokers smoke and they make the awful atmosphere in the area. Smoking is a terrible thing for human health. It makes people be cancer and damage the lung. People who smoke may think that there is no harmful effect to the health. The truth is smoking is harmful both smoker and people who stay near the smoker. You can see from the advertisements on the television. They are trying to persuade that smoking is not good for the health of smoker and the people who stay near them. I think that the restaurant should not allow the smoker to smoke in the restaurants. We should not let the smoker go in to the public place too such as university, hospital, shopping mall, market, concert and movie theater as well. Finally, we must inform the smoker why we do not want them smoke in the public place because it will make people be harmful and unhealthy. If the smoker can decrease their cigarette per day they can have a long life.
