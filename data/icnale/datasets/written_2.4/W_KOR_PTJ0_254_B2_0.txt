I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, it gives people to experience something special, which is different from the studying in a college. If a college student works part-time job, he/she might be able to experience the outer society earlier than other students who don't work part-time job. For example, they have to learn patient to the boss or complaining customers. In addition, the students who have a part-time job can understand the value of money. The part-time job might teach the students that money is not come free. It teaches that if they wanted to earn money, they have to pay the time and their efforts, and then after they realize the value of money, they are relatively saving money than those who don't understand that. Finally, doing part-time job makes the college students independent from their parents. Just aging doesn't mean a person to become an adult. If the students want to be respected as an adult, they have to be independent from their parents. Being independent means they can take care of themselves. In our society, taking care of someone needs money, so the first step for independent is financially independence. Therefore in my opinion, having a part-time job is important for college students.
