 Nowadays many college students want to have a part time job. The tendency is becoming more and more popular. Some people approve of this because they think it is a good chance to improve their ability. But other students don't agree on it. They find that if they spend their time on doing a job, they can't focus on their study. It's just a waste of time. In my opinion, although there are both advantages and disadvantages in finding a part-time job for college students, I still believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, it can truly improve our ability. As we all know, the knowledge we have already learned from schools is very limited. And the society is also a school. So learning from the society can also improve us. Second, we can get some reward from the job. Although the amount can be very little, we can learn that No pains, no gains. The little reward can also help us to understand the hardness of doing a job and form a good habit of saving money. Third, we can also feel the importance of study. In addition, as to the problem of wasting time, I believe that it depends on different people. But if we arrange time properly, doing a part-time job will not have a great influence on our study. In one word, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
