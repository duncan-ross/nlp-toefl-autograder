 Smoking has been around through the history of man, for recreational and medicinal purposes. Hence you might say that smoking a cigarette is second-nature to Man because almost everyone has grown up seeing adults smoking in real life and in the media. These experiences, no matter how personal, definitely affect us subconsciously to pick up the habit in the future. It just depends on our personal attitude towards the health and social concerns toward it. Hence completely banning the smoking of cigarettes in a public area, like all restaurants in the country, would seem to be too harsh of a policy. Many restaurants have set up an open area for smokers, so that the fumes from their burnt cigarettes would not bother non-smoking customers. However there are many health issues concerning smoking that may create strong advocators of this proposed ban. Such issues like "second-hand smoking" being even more cancerous than first-hand smoking would raise many alarms. Especially in a environment that needs to maintain hygiene, that is the restaurants, allowing customers or staff to smoke would seem to be counter-intuitive to the aim of maintaining cleanliness to avoid food poisoning and other contamination. Hence I believe that strong reminders need to be made against smoking in restaurants, emphasising on consideration for others over personal benefits of lighting a cigarette. However, an official ban seems too harsh a treatment for a smoker who has a bodily need to have a cigarette.
