Nowadays, more and more college students are getting out of the school and do some part-time jobs while still doing their study. So, what's the reason? Apparently, it is, maybe not necessary, very important to do some part-time jobs. The importances are as follows:Firstly, as we all know, the college education pays more attention not to the practice but to the theory. However, part-time job is a chance for the students to use what they got at school and to change their theory into practice. Meanwhile, it can enrich their college life as well as improve their work abilities. Secondly, the students will get much experience through part-time job, such as how to get along with their boss and colleagues and how to develop the attitude to shoulder their responsibilities. The experience they get can do much help to their job finding after graduate. Finally, doing part-time jobs can help the students gain independence, especially the financial independence? Although it seems impossible, we have the desire to make our own living because we are already adults. However, we can earn some money if we do part-time jobs. Thus, we can ask for much less money from our parents, which can make us feel more independent.
