The reality of life usually starts when one is already working. Eyes are opened to the ugly truth which pertains to the life which is really simple but people are making it complicated. People are so busy. You sleep late. You get up early. You get broke. You can't really depend on someone all the time. I believe that some college students have been already realizing about the reality of life though, since some already have a part time job. In my opinion, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Every step that we take prepares us for the following big step. Being a college student as well, I believe that we must be preparing for more pressuring toils that we have to withstand in the future. Not to mention the sleepless nights because of the overload of home works, a part time job would be really a part of the training. People look at this situation at different perspectives. Most look it as a way to earn money to spend for shopping or for other desired wants. Some think of it as a way for starting an investment for their future. While a few view it as a way to train their selves in preparation for the real world.
