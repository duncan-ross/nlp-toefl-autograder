I agree that smoking should be banned restaurants to rapidly changing country. Because smoking can harm others indirectly, and it will spoil the atmosphere in the diet. All parties must have prohibited smoking in restaurants. Must be provided for them by smoking. It may take, but it must begin to have people follow. The government should set the strong rules for citizen. I will give you example in other countries where stating very strong law. For instance in Singapore any attempts to import cannabis or other drugs are punished with death by hanging, which applies even if you are unaware that they are in your possession. At the very least, in most countries, you will not be permitted to cross the border with the products still in your possession. Penalties for purchase, possession, and/or use within a given country can range from none to severe. Know the local laws. If Thailand can make such a very strong law and importantly all citizen willing to respect the law and act quickly in time can push our country to keep moving forwards to be the developed country in the near future. If people just think that this is just a small problem and is not their own business, it is hard to improve our country to be developed and all smokers will be around not just only in the restaurants for sure.
