Almost students who haven't had a part-time job don't have a good experience to improve themselves to be adulthood. Every part-time job is a way to make a person adult. If they didn't have a part time job, they will not know that what is important for life. This thing will provoke people to feel what life means. When they work, they have to think a lot. And they will meet a lot of failure that make them strong. Moreover, they have to plan what should to do in one day to be not much fall. I know a person, she is poor and her parents were died, is very industrious. She works in every evening and she told me that if she doesn't fight, she must be died. I think she has a lot of obligation to strict herself. Although she hasn't have parents teaching her, she always teaches herself and step to be a strong girl. Comparing to others who have parents, I think if they work a little, and observer what should do. I think it can increase the ability of the students in learning too because they know what to do for the life and then they can plan for reading or everything that can improve them. Thus, Part-time job is important for the students to improve them in many abilities.
