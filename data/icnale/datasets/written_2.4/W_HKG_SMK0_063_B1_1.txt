My attitude toward smoking is do not try to smoke, for those smoker, I encouraging them to give up. Why I say so ? There are two concrete reasons. First, smoking is very harmful to our body. Every year, numerous people is died from lung cancer, which is caused by smoking. Those chemicals in cigarette is highly toxic, after you breath in these chemicals to your lung, your lung will be seriously damaged. After a period of time, you respiratory system will decays and you will find difficult to breath and hard to cure. IN addition, for those people who do not smoke also affected by smokers. Thanks to the second hand smoke, many innocent people also get harm, and people who get lung cancer by second hand smoke is much more than those smoke people. Second, many people claim that they can quit form smoking once if they find health problem. However, they under estimate the addiction effect of smoking. Once you try smoking, you will only smoke for more frequently, and will not decrease the rate. In reality, tones of cases show that most people cannot quit from smoking, although someone can do so, after a period of time, they will smoke again. Also Smoking is very expensive, and right now, the tax rate of cigarette is extremely high in HK, Money spend on smoking in a long run is not the value you can be expected.
