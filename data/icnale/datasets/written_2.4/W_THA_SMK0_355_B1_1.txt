Smoking cigarette is a normal thing for our daily life now. Many people love to smoke and also lot of people don't like to smoke. The important thing is where do you smoke? In my opinion, I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The easy reason is, it disturbs to the others who is having meal. Smokers should have a smoking manner. Even though, it's legal to smoke in the restaurant. First of all, if they don't think about the others but they should think about their health. Smoking causes a lot of problem. If you smoke everyday, make sure that you will have a cancer in the future. Smoking in the restaurant is really rude and fool behavior. If smokers have a moral, our society must be really great. However, for the one who can't stop smoking, just think a little bit about the other. If you are in the restaurant and you really want to smoke, just walk outside of the restaurant, then take your time. It's good for you that you can smoke it and it's good for the others that it doesn't disturb anyone. Finally, I still confirm that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. It must be good if all of smokers consider about that.
