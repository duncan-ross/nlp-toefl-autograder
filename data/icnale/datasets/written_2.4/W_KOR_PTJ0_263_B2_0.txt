Many Korean college students get part-time jobs as soon as they graduate from their highschools. For example, they can tutor students or work at fast food restaurants. However, there are some parents who forbid their children from applying for these jobs. It is very controversial whether or not part-time jobs are necessary to college students. I think that these jobs are benefecial to them in terms of two reasons. First and Foremost, we should differentiate university students from elemenatry, junior high, and high school students. As a matter of fact, they are grown-ups, who are responsible for managing their own lives. Although getting good GPA is important, being able to take care of their budget should also be reagarded as an important task. If a grown-up still recieves pocket money from his parents, what is different between young children and grown-ups? A person like this should feel embarrassed. Secondly, students can earn various experiences by working in various fields. For example, books do not tell them how to make delicious hamburgers or how to serve customers. On the other hand, a person who works at a restaruant can learn these practical skills and useful knowledge. Through these unique experiences, people can find out in which they are interested to work in the near futurel. I do not think that working as a part-time worker is a waste of time for college students. Instead, it teaches responsibility and provides an invaluble message to them. Therefore, I agree that it is imporant for college students to have part-time jobs.
