Smoking kills you, as to what many people believe, say, and even advocate about—and affecting others is just as bad as committing an heinous crime. But freedom of choice is in itself a part of our law and lives, and banning all smoking areas in all restaurants may cause a rebellion towards others. The Philippines is a democratic nation and taking off an option from the freedom of people is not advisable. Restaurants banning smoking areas may be allowed, but banning it from ALL restaurants is a different situation. Restricting smoking areas in all restaurants would either cause others to compromise the situation and still smoke, or some restaurants will lose majority of their customers—and other situations could possibly occur. Discouraging smoking is a very significant act that a country should promote, but if it causes others to rebel against it, then it should be softened otherwise. Having the support of the majority is great, but having almost all the support of the people is way better. If there was a bill that would ban all smoking areas in all restaurants, then I would suggest that it should get almost all approval from each citizen. This is order to enforce a freedom and peaceful choice for everyone. And if this was to be implemented, then I would further suggest that the country should advocate the stop of smoking more in order to convince and enlighten the people to have better and healthier lives.
