I agree. In my opinion, I think many people want to sit in a clean restaurant. If you saw a smoker in restaurant you would go out. Because smoking has a bad effects on health. So it will be great if every one has cooperation. Many people want to sit in the clean restaurant. When you're eating. You don't want the smell of cigarettes. Sometimes feel bored with delicious food immediately. I think for smoker, if you want to smoking in the restaurant, you can get out. You should not damage the good feeling when a customer eating. Certainly. Smoking is bad for your healthy, whether you smoke by yourself or the smell from cigarettes disadvantage is on your own body. Many people who die from smoking relate a disease exceeds the total figure for deaths cause by breast cancer. Furthermore smoking is the most important cause of lung cancer. Smoking lung cancer is more likely. Non-smoking, 10 as those who inhale tobacco smoke of other at risk of lung cancer. Finally. I think, if the government legislation on banned smoking in the entire restaurant, it would be regular. Although people are still smoking they should come outside because a customer does not want the smell. If everyone has cooperation, it will be protect both you and others
