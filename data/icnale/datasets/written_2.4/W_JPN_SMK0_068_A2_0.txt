I agree. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The reason I think so is very simple. Smoking is bad for health. People who don't want to smoke, including me, have the right that we don't smoke. So smoking should be banned at not only restaurants but also at all public areas. Some says that separating the area between smoking and non-smoking prevents people who don't want to smoke from smoking. But the smoker's clothes have smell of cigarette. And more over it is true that waiters must smoke to order. Smoking in the restaurant is bad for smokers. Because dishes have own smell. Smell of cigarette prevents smokers from eating dishes delicious. Smoking has no benefit for all people in the restaurant. Nowadays, the number of non-smoking area is increased, such as hospital, station and so on. And smoking is banned at all restaurants in one foreign country. It is not difficult to change smoking restaurant to non-smoking restaurant. It goes without saying that smoking is bad for health. We must not rob of other people's health. And we want to enjoy eating. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
