The air is something that we need in our daily life. We breathe the air around us every day and every second of our life. We need this to be able to survive and for us to live. Smoking is one cause of our polluted air that makes our life miserable. Smoking is very usual to us, we see smokers whenever we turn our head they are everywhere. In some places smoking is not allowed, also some municipalities are not allowing people to smoke anywhere they just assign a spot where you can smoke. There are also some establishments that prohibit the smokers. Restaurants should ban the smokers so that the non-smokers won't be bothered. The smoke from the cigarettes are hazardous to our health, smoking is dangerous but second hand smoke is more dangerous so people who will inhale the smoke is more likely to get ill than those who smoke. I agree that smoking should be ban in restaurants, especially those restaurants who have a closed space that doesn't allow the air to go out but just circulate around. They should not only ban smoking in restaurants but also in public places, because it has a great effect in our health. Smokers should be responsible enough to know where and when to smoke.
