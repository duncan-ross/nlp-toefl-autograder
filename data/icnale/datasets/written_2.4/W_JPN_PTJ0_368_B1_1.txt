I agree with this opinion. You may say that college students should study hard so that they can play active in society, but it is not correct. I support this opinion with three opinions. First of all, they are able to make many friends. There are the younger generation and the middle generation and the older generation in workplace. Students may learn many things from working or communicationing or spending with middle or older genaration who live longer than them. Second, they learn the importance of money. You may understand that, we realize the importance of thing or how hard it is when we experience it. In my experience, when I started to work a part time that I earn 800 yen per an hour, I can't buy things which cost me over 800 yen easily. Third, my last opinion, they can earn money. How to use it is varied, for example, school fee, money for food, money for club activity, and others. One of these is money for travel abroad, now I save my money for this. I have been abroad for only once. It happened when I was three and hardly remmember. But, according to friends, teachers, and books, it is so great. When college students look at many things in abroad countries, they look at things with new eyes. Conclusingly, college students should work for a part time job and earn money, of course. I think that these experience may help them in their future.
