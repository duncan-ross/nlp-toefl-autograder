People nowadays spend their spare time useful. They make themselves productive when they have nothing to do. And make sure they earn some benefit from that thing they are up to. Best example? A Part time job. A part time job is only a temporary work in a short period of time. Well anyone can really get a part time job. Even students can get one, as long as they can do what they applied for. They work to earn some money and use it for their studies, family and etc. But most of them, they are students who are working to support their financial needs. They search for a part time job because they can't get a real job that needs all of your time. One can't give all of his/her time when he/she is studying. One won't be able to focus on their studies because of the time allotted for them to study is very short. Unlike in a part time job, you have more time in studying even if it's not that long. I really salute to those who can balance their time in studying and working. Because you can really see in them that they're willing to do anything just to study. And they really excel in class; they make sure that their hard work in working in a part time job is really worth it. Because they know their work is only temporary, they make sure that it's all worth it.
