The discussion with my partner gave a valuable result. We were in the same way that government should ban smoking in the restaurant. The reason is very clear. we all know that smoking has a bad effect for smoker itself and for the passive smoker. Therefore, it is the government's responsibility to decrease smoking activities through the program of forbidding to smoke especially in public area. Restaurant is one of public area that should be enjoyable, comfortable and safe for the customers or visitors. When someone smokes other people will be disturbed. In addition Indonesian people have a bad behavior. They will smoke after having meal. They will not be relaxed if they don't smoke after having a meal. So, the people, especially men, mostly smoke when they are in a restaurant. It will possibly disturb other people. In this case, restaurant have a big advantages especially for smokers that usually like getting together with their partners by having some meals and beverages. When they have a spare time, they will set an appointment to go to a restaurant (for example) and then have a chat. At this time, they often smoke in there. It's a common behavior. Therefore we can not let it happen it will reduce the comfort of the restaurant.
