My opinion the part time job has advantage and disadvantage. Because the part time job makes students have a short time to prepare education or reading books for exam. The part time job makes students have low or drop grade because they use almost time to their part time job. That is disadvantage about part time job in my opinion but the most important thing is allocate time of mine. But part time job makes student have more money and then they can use it to buy stationary or buy everything that they want. When they get money by part time job they should use it for family. Those are all advantage and disadvantage about part time job in my opinion. Having considered in detail, I still hold on my position that teenagers essentially need to work at least one job when they are student in schools to receive several benefit from it. So, I predict that schools and parents will support our young person to work a part time job. We have to ask ourselves, who can deny the importance of working of teenagers or we can ask ourselves should we do our best in our study? All people got their own reasons and they choose their own paths for going.
