I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the act of smoking is bad to bodies no matter the smokers or people around the smokers. The smokers have trouble not smoking again. If people smoke for a long time, they will get the lung cancer. The color of lung will be change from fresh red to black. And they often get cough. Second, the restaurants is where people enjoy foods in. people should enjoy the meals in a good environment, and the restaurants is public place, smokers should respect the other people's right and health. The smell of smoking is so ugly and I never think that when a man is smoking, his act is very handsome. I don't know what on earth the girls think about. Not only people who don't smoke have rights but also the smokers have rights to choose whether they smoke or not. Maybe the restaurants can place a room that only smokers can enter. So that people who don't smoke can use their meal delight and the smokers can smoke freely. I just think only a few restaurants can be placed smoking room now. I hope that the smoking room can be no use ever forever. The smokers could decrease slowly.
