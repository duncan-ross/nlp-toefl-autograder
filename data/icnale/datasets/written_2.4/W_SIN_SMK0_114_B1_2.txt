First, before I start the essay, I need to define what smoking means. Smoking in this context apparently refers to the act of putting a cigarette to one's mouth, lighting it, and puffing on it vigourously such that smoke from the cigarette enters your lungs. Generally, the effect of this would be to give that person a slight high due to the effect of nicotine on the mind. There are other definitions of smoking, such as the Singaporean definition, which is to pull wool over another's eyes. Now that I have defined smoking, I need to define restaurants. Restaurants can be defined as a place where people, generally humans of the species Homo sapiens sapiens, as opposed to Homo erectus, ingest sustenance. This sustenance is generally believed to taste good due to the fact that it was ingested in a restaurant. Since the purpose of the restaurant is to provide a place with ambience so that the food ingested is perceived to taste better, smoking detracts from this experience as smoking is generally disliked by the people around the smoker. As such, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country as it detracts from the very purpose of a restaurant, which is to provide a location for people to enjoy good food.
