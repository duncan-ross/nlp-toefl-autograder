I do not think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. We are very young, and we have a lot to worry about, so we don't need to waste any time on things that we don't absolutely have to do. For example, when major is engineering, and every week I have hours and hours of classes and homework and lab assignments. Even if I wanted to work, I would be hard pressed to find the time, and I also think that I would be very stressed out by adding anything more to my already busy schedule. I know a lot of people would disagree with me on this, but I kind of think it is parent's responsibility to provide for their children at least through college. Certainly, after they graduate student should get a fulltime job in begin their careers in earnest, but for the time being I think we should enjoy the little time we have before we're forced to become real adults and spend all our time being serious. In addition, I don't understand why everyone expects us to be so responsible even though we're just kids, so I think it is not really necessary for college students to be working.
