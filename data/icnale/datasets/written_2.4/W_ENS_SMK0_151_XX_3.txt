I don't agree because firstly, there are way too many smokers' opinions in Japan for the Japanese Government to just override and secondly, it really should be up to each restaurant and each person to decide for themselves without Government interference. If I owned a restaurant and I was complying with the standard food and beverage laws, why should the government Japanese or otherwise, come in and tell me how to run my business. What would be next on the agenda, banning karaoke or non-bottled water, only allowing customers in who are wearing pink shoes? A restaurant is usually a private concern and should be left that way if they meet the standard health regulations related to food and drink that I mentioned. The moment that governments start to over-regulate is usually when the problem/s get worse. Apart from kids, adults should be allowed to make their own choices about where they want to eat and the restaurants have the right to allow or disallow smoking on their own premises. That's just a part of fair trade in my view and consumers have the right to let their wallets do their talking by not going to smoking or non-smoking venues/restaurants as they see fit.
