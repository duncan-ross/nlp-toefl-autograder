Smoking is also an evil of our society. We inhale smoke in our body. Some people smoke with cigarette. Huqa or cigar. Some people smoke just for enjoyment or fashion, some for gestational problems and some for habit. Smoking is very dangerous for health. It effects on chests, lungs and our mouth. Mostly old people and adults are victim the chest and lungs problems. It also caused the cancer. In European countries women are also chain smokers. People smoke due to tension and depression. The govt should banned the smoking. This matter should discussed on higher levels. Smoking is not only the wastage of money. Its also very dangerous for health. So govt should take part to ban it in gathering and also in public places. In our policies the govt should fined the adults under 18 and also the shop keepers who sell this poison the adults under 18. When some time the women smoke they give berth to the children who are not physically healthy and normal. So in this way smoking is equally bad for the mother and the child and the children learn from the mother. When they saw their mothers smokers they also start smoking. It must should be banned in all the countries.
