In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not has effects on the many non smokers. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking which may later develop into a habit. Everyone knows cigarette is bad. We feel terrible when member in family is smoker. Cigarette destroys smoker and his family. Men smoke cigarette more than women. However, women tend to smoker cigarette increase. Every country fight people to discontinue smoking cigarette because it makes to be ill. So it is true that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's smell destroy smoker and people in general. Pollutant of cigarette adheres food and drink. In addition, pollutant of cigarette adheres clothes. Pollutant of cigarette is dangerous. When infant get pollutant of cigarette, it destroys nerve. Smoking cigarette make nicotinism. Nicotinism causes that nicotin is in body too many. The smokers should stop smoking cigarettes for their family or themselves. our laws should not say that the purchase of cigarettes is legal, but actually smoking them in any public place is not. I do believe that a smoker should do so responsibly and with respect to those who do not smoke.
