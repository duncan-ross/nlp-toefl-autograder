Nowadays, it is gradually accepted that smoking is a bad habit. Consequently, more and more countries have set laws to ban smoking in public places. As far as I'm concerned, that is terrific for us. Smoking is a bad habit, since it is bad for not only smokers, but people around them as well. It is unfair for them to suffer from smoking, for they don't do anything wrong but have a risk on their health. As the Bible says, everyone is born equal. Therefore, for the sake of non-smokers, our government should ban smoking. Laws should protect the benefit of the most people and show the equality of human society. Smoking is supposed to be forbidden in public places. On the other hand, smoking, itself, is a nuisance for our human society. It is thought to be a big cause of cancer as well as other diseases. Both the smokers and the second-hand smokers have a high risk on gaining the No. 1 killer---cancer. For instance, in a family, father is a smoker while his wife and his children are second-hand smokers. Study showed that about one-third of the cancer is related to smoking. Government ought to discourage people not to smoke. In addition, smoking do harm to our environment because it releases many kinds of harmful gas when lighted and tobacco agriculture is bad for our earth. In one word, smoking is nothing good but a sudden joy to the smoker when smoking. Smoking in public places should be banned. Let's say 'smoking free' to our society.
