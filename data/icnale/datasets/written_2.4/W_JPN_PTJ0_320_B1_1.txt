I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have three ideas. First, a part time job's incomes enable us to live a rich life without parent's help. I think this thing leads us independence from parents or families. For example, my friend studies for future, of course using her income. Next, this experience becomes learning to orient the community, and we learn ability of cooperation. Now, I job at the bar. I made many friends there. They are my precious friends except job time. And I learn etiquette or correct tongue, too. And Thanks to this experience, I grow up my sense of responsibility. Last, there are many kinds of a part time job. For example, restaurant, tutor, lecturer of private school, and temporary employment agency's jobs, etc. So we have many choices. And we can select our favorite jobs. If we would get a job, we couldn't experience various jobs. If we job very hard, we might neglect college's study or club activity. This thing is very unhappy. So, I think it is important that we have to fulfill a duty, for example, college's study. But a part of job's experiences surely connect our future. Absolutely, this experience is very useful in the society. So, I think a part time job is important for college students.
