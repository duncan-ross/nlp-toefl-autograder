Because smoking is so detrimental to the health of anyone who participates in it, smoking should be banned at restaurants. I have never been to Japan, but I do have one or two study abroad friends who have come to my university, and after I asked them about this question, they said that smoking was very prevalent in Japanese restaurants. I think this is a bad thing, because it gives the message that the Japanese people are OK with the spread of cancer and do not care about the people who have to breathe and the second hand smoke. A country as advanced as Japan should understand this and should not allow the opinions of smokers who just want to have a nicotine fix to affect that image of the country as a whole. Also, smoking can severely affect the quality of life especially in the last years of smokers and can also have a big impact on the actual length of life. I think it is safe to say that anyone who regularly engages in smoking will have a much shorter lifespan than those that do not, and the last field of years of their life will be filled with pain and misery.
