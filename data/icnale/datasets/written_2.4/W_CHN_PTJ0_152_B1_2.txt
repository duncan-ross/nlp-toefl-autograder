Though doing part-time is good for students in many aspects, I don't think it is very important for college students to have a part time job. I have reasons in the following paragraphs. There are many advantages for college students to take part time jobs while they are at college. Firstly, part time jobs will offer us students a chance to demonstrate our ability and to apply what we have learned at college. Secondly, part time jobs help us become more independent of our families because we can get money from doing part time jobs. Thirdly, the experience we gain through part time may be of great help to our future. When we look for jobs in the future, we can be more experienced. However, a part time job has some disadvantages. For example, we may lose time needed for sleep, rest and recreation. If we take part time jobs, it is likely for us to be so interested in the work that we cannot pay attention to our study. In my opinion, as a student we should we should hold the right attitude towards the part-time jobs, for acquiring knowledge, especially more book knowledge, is our first important task. Although part time jobs can do us some good in some aspects, we should pay more attention to school study than to part time jobs.
