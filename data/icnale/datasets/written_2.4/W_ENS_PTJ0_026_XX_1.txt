Many college students enjoy having a part-time job, but many college students also feel that they have enough work in their classes that they will not be able to balance the demands upon their time that having a part time job would impose. Thus, it is really not a question of whether all college students should have a part-time job or whether no college student should have a part-time job but rather a question of the appropriateness of a part time job given a specific student's situation. Students who feel that they have enough time to have a part-time job are good candidates for work study programs and can make a little bit of money as well. Students who do not feel that they have enough time for part-time jobs should just focus on their studies and not allow themselves to be distracted. This is the best solution for everyone and it allows the students decide for themselves whether are not they would like a part-time job. Another benefit is that if someone makes the wrong decision, they always have the choice of undoing that decision since part-time jobs in college are not that serious. For these reasons, a student should really decide for himself or for herself if a part-time job is appropriate.
