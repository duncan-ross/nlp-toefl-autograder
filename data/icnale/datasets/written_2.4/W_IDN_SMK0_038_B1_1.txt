I agree that smoking should be banned.. Because many people didn't smoke in the restaurants. People feel uncomfortable when they breathe. And it's bothering them. Can you imagine, when you are eating and there is someone besides you are smoking? It must be uncomfort right? So I agree that smoking must be prohibit in the restaurants. Sometimes there is a baby or a child in the restaurant, and they must caught because there is someone smoke in there. It's not good for their health. Smoking in the restaurants is selfish. Why don't go outside and smoking in the outside of the restaurants. Sometimes they don't think the impact of smoking in the restaurants. But it's not good for their health. not only for their health but also for people around them's heath. So, some restaurants have a smoking area to solve this problem. Where the smokers stay there to smoke. It is very efficient because the smokers stay with the smokers also. But some restaurants did not provides the smoking area. This is the problem then. If you disagree the statement above, you must make sure that all of restaurants in this country have a smoking area. And all of the people can feel comfort.
