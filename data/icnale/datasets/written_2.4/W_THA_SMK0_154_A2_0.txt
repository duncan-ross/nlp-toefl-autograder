Smoking is something that teenagers today are popular smoking same fashion without knowing the penalty for smoking tobacco. Smoking is addictive substance that is harmful to the body. Smoking is not just physical abuse male smoking itself only to hurt people around you and the environment as well I think smoking in restaurants is not appropriate because the department is most people come to eat and maybe have children to eat by smoking is not suitable to smoke in restaurants because it is a danger to people nearby. They like to smoke but other don't so don't hurt people who want to eat by having smoking inside the restaurants. The servers should tell them to stop because they hold the right to tell customers in the restaurants not the customers. If the servers cannot handle it they should tell the managers or the owners to get rid of that person. I mean to take them out the restaurants but before that they must try to talk with the smokers nicely. If the smokers still acting rude to them. I think the guard should throw them out of the restaurants and ban them to come back again ever. Thus, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants.
