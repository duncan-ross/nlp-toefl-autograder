 We all agree that smoking does harm to our health. And we also advice smokers to lay aside this habit, and some countries pass laws that smoking in the public places is banned. Yeah, it is really necessary. But we must consider the large number of smokers, we must safeguard their rights. So, we should not forbid them from smoking in all restaurants. We could classify the restaurants into two kinds. We can provide some special restaurants for the smokers, and in others, smoking should be banned. Of course, this is only one solution to the problem. But, we must respect the smokers' rights. We can advice, but we can not do harm to their rights. If smoking is completely banned in all restaurants in the coutry, maybe it does effect someone to give it up. But, what we do will not lead to a good ending. Though we sacrifice others' rights to make our thoughts come true, we also realize that maybe some day we could be the others. So, smoking shouldn't be completed banned in all restaurants in the country.
