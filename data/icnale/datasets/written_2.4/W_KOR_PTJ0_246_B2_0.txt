As far as college student's having a part time job, I will suggest 3 supports on the below. First of all, students are born to study other than having part-time job with spending a lot of time. Nowadays, most of part-time job owners force student to spend a lot of time by making the contract filled out when they get a job. However, once the contract is submitted to the employers, it is extremely hard to reject their offer even if they have a lot of homework that should be dealt with on a day and night. Therefore, it would be better not to start to avoid such traps. Secondly, instead of trying to get money by having part time job, they can take alternatives. When we take a closer look to colleges, there are a lot of scholarships designed to students. Thus, for college students, it is reasonable to take a way to get a scholarship by studying hard instead of killing a lot of time. Finally, it can do other meaningful activities in college rather than having a part- time job. The experience students can get by part-time job is not important as students can go through this experience when they get a real job after graduation; however, the experience regarding meaningful activities never will not be back once this period is over. Considering that it is not easy to take 2 rabbits at a time because of the time limit, we can conclude that students should experience more meaningful experience that needs less time.
