I totally agree with this statement. Personally, I think university is a transition between narrow study and the more open society. In recent years, a large number of graduates fail to find a job after their graduation. One reason is that they seldom take a part-time job at university so that they haven't accumulated any job experience. As we all know, a lot of job hunting advertisements show that experienced hunters are usually needed. A adult with one year or more of job experience is easier to acquire a suitable job. To fit the demand, we college students had better take at least a part-time job at our free time. What can we do if we take a part-time job?From my point of view, the common choice is to be a tutor. We can make the most use of our alreay acquired knowledge. We can teach a high, middle school student or even a pupil, we can teach them maths, Chinese, English and so on. Apart from a tutor, a job in a small restaurant is OK. There we can experience the tough living and working conditions so that we won't spoil the better job-if can-we get in the future. To sum up, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, we should still focus on our major. Only if we get a high degree, can we make full use of our knowledge.
