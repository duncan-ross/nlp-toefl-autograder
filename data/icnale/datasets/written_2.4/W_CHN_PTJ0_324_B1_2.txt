 This time, a great many university students choose to do part-time job during their leisure time. The desire for this is quite different, some for the financial aid, some for the working experience. Even, there are many people who just want to learn to how to adjust to the cruel social competition. Here I'd like to say something about my point of view. Firstly, from doing part-time, you can learn many things that we can't get in book. During working, you start to find out how hard to survive, to live on one's own. This will bring a lot of benefits to our future while the others are complaining about the hard pressure. Moreover, if the part-time job is concerned with your major, it will put your knowledge into practice. That's would be excellent advantage when you take part in an interview when the company takes the working experience seriously. There is no doubt that part-time job will make you more independent from your parents and family. However, every coin has two sides. Part-time job will surely take lots of time, not only spare time, but also your study time. So there is an annoying question which is faced with you: how to keep a balance between the work and study? Speak personally, I tend to put study in the first. For your job is student, your main task is to study, to get higher grade, not just for the money that seem to make your present life more comfortable. In conclusion, if once I am about to do the part-time job, I will see does it have anything to do with my major or does it cover too much time. Anyway, study while doing the job is my hope.
