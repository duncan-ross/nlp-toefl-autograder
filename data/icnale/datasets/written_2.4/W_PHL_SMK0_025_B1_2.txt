In today's society, a lot of countries have passed laws that ban smoking in public places, especially restaurants, because second hand smoking has been proven to be unsafe. Second hand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, which are known to cause cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Not only does it participate in one's body problems, it also contributes to the world's environmental problems. Some may argue that if smoking is banned permanently in restaurants, people will take it as another personal interference by the government. This is not essentially correct. Smoking in restaurants damages the public's health against their will and this could cause them a variety of lung diseases. People go to restaurants thing to have a social gathering, relax, or to simply have a quality time with their loved ones. Doing it in an unhealthy and unpleasant environment isn't necessarily enjoyable. Smokers also need to think about those people around them who are exposed to smoke, pregnant women, children, elderly, and the asthmatic. Smoking around them, in my honest opinion, is a selfish to do. If smokers want to take these risks, that is fine, but they should have to limit their smoking to the comfort of their own car or home and not in public places where the public is unwillingly exposed to second-hand smoke and its harmful effects. If people want to smoke despite the fact that it's dangerous to their health, it's completely fine so long as they limit their habit where no one who is unwillingly exposed to second hand smoke gets distressed. I believe that a smoker's bad choice shouldn't affect other people; hence, why it should be banned in restaurants. Smokers already have the liberty to smoke at their own will and privacy, so I suppose banning it in restaurants is beyond reasonable.
