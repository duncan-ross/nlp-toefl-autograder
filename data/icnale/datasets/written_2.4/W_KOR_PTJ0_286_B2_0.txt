I am opposite side of getting part time job in the College life. I think periods of college are not appropriate to do part-time jobs, especially if those jobs are included in the simeple labor. There are many kinds of part-time jobs all around us. The money we can get from those also are of variety. For instance, there are tutors and staff in the restaurnat or store. Compared to other part time jobs, being tutor is very helpful to make money much more well. On the other hand, We can get little money by serving in the restaurant and being in the counter in the store, Those things are very simple so I think it cannot give a meaningful experience. I doubt if it is worth investing our time in doing them. At that time of doing those things, we can do much more productive things. Were it not for the situation of having a hard time to make a living, I strongly maintain that we should do much more creative and desirable things instead of simple labor. . Before the graduation of college, it is important to broaden our experience and diversify our way of thinking. Earning money is not our priority. We have to deeply explore the academic world and do a volunteering or community work. We have to discover our hidden potential or dream I really want to do. Depending on them, We can make our specific porfolio to develop our potential and come true our cherished dream.
