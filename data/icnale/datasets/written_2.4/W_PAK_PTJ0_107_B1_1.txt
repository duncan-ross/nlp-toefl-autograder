Many students in the country work past time job and also attend high school. Many of them manage these taro job properly. Which allows them to maintain good result while finding a personas source of income. Other high School Students are not able at to balance the to responsibilities in most causes. The past time job becomes to much hard to handle, and results being sleeping. In spite of all these facts apart time job is becoming necessary in a high school students life. Money is necessary for every one to fact is that responsible students will have no problems balancing a job and schools. But average students cannot mange their jobs and studies. They cannot enjoy their life. Because a part time job occupies time that should be spent on home work, studies, extra curricular act ivies. In my opinion both sides nave very valid arguments. Job does teach children responsibility. When doing a part time job, students can earn money by their own so they can grow up. In conclusion, a part time job benefits a university student in be more independent, experiend and Confident. As well as it helps him to cover his needs in daily life.
