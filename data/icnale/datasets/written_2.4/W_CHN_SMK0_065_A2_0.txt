In my perspective, I disagree with this opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons. Firstly, in my opinion, there are some restaurants have two parts. One is the smoking area and another is non-smoking area. I believe it is a good way not to influence people not like smoke if smokers smoke in the restaurants. We can have more restaurants like this. So we need not ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, it is unfair to force people smoked for a long time not smoke in the restaurants. If all the restaurants completely ban smoking, how can they have meal in all the restaurants? In China, many people smoke with people in the restaurants to do business. If it is completely banned, they will have problems for business. Thirdly, restaurants ban smoking will not attract smokers and they will influence their business. If I smoke and the restaurants ban smoking, I will go to the restaurants any longer. How can earn money?Last but not least, many smokers throw cigarettes everywhere in the restaurants. Some people say it is very dangerous because many fire happen because this.
