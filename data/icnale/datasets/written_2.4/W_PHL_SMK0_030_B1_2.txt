Smoking in restaurants will affect other dinners specially those children and senescence people. And it is not proper to smoke in place where foods are serving and with other people on your side. So it is just right to banned smoking in restaurants. In smoking in this place many people are harm and being a secondhand smoker tends to have more bad effect. And they should not only ban smoking in restaurants but also in all public areas. They can smoke but only in the place where no one can be harm. And there are lots of ways in relaxing other than smoking. They also use smoking in relieving stress but there are other forms of stress relieving activities. Reason for some people for smoking inside a restaurant is for their digesting food because some people said that it helps them to digest. But I think it really helps them maybe they always think that way and even though it is not true they still believe on it. Stop or making a law that banned smoking in restaurants will be useful in many ways because for me I 'm in a restaurant and someone will smoke I'll feel disrespect. For the reason that I 'm eating then suddenly I can smell the cigarette of other people and beside his is not the only customer in that restaurant.
