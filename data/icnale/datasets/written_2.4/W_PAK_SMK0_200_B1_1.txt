It is commonly said that smoking is injurious for health. But it is a bad luck of our nation that in spite of knowing the dangers of smoking they do not often care for these restrictions and healthcare warnings. We find smokers smoking the cigarettes on roads, markets, restaurants and other public places. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, other people also feel disturbance because of smoking in restaurants. The smoke screens of cigarette are untolerateable for some people. The smoke screens are also cause of lung cancer in non-smokers because they inhale them through air. Secondly, smoking also mars the charm of environment and people avoid going in such restaurants. It pollutes the environment and makes it a source of illness. We should act quickly to check all such kinds of evils. There should be an end to this bad activity that affects the vision and peace of mind of the people. We need to understand the true dimension of pollution created by smokers in restaurants that is perhaps one of the greatest problems of our country, as much as of the old, plaguing the health and well being of the billions. Smoking needs to be banned in restaurants.
