A part-time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. Workers are considered to be part time if they commonly work fewer than 30 or 35 hours per week. There are many reasons for working part time, including the desire to do so, having one's hours cut back by an employer and being unable to find a full-time job. "Part-time" can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes only a few courses, rather than a full load of coursework each semester. And it is very helpful to the student when he/she has a part time job because the salary may use for the allowance in everyday fare and the other need for school like books and the like. Many students whose work is part time job, sometimes students just take as a working experience not for the sake of extra money but the experience. Like me I want to have part time job for the experience only, so that I have experience when I apply for a certain job in the future. Part time job for the students is a big help for them even though it's a little bit difficult but they need to do it for many reason.
