I agree with this statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, it's now well-known that both first-hand and second-hand smoke can cause cancer. So, being in the vicinity of someone smoking, especially indoors where there is little ventilation, can adversely affect one's health. I go to restaurants to enjoy healthy food and, as a paying customer, I shouldn't have to risk my health sitting near smokers. Second, servers and other restaurant staff shouldn't have to work around harmful cigarette smoke, especially on a daily basis. Employees have a right to work in a safe environment, which includes a smoke-free establishment. Even if there was a separate section for smoking customers, workers would still be exposed to harmful fumes. Third, cigarette smoke smells terrible and even a small whiff of it can quickly spoil ones appetite and ruin the mood. I want to smell the food as it's being prepared in the kitchen and savor it as it arrives on my plate. This is an enjoyable part of dining out, which would suffer if I had to sit near smokers. Lastly, many industrialized nations, including the U. S., ban smoking in restaurants and most bars to protect customers and workers. Japan should follow suit and take measures to protect the health of its citizens. And completely banning smoking in restaurants is one good way to do this.
