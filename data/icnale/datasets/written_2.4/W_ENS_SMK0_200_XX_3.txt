Yes, for the love of God, please ban smoking at Japanese restaurants. I have spent too much time in a hospital watching otherwise beautiful and pleasant people suffer from their decision to smoke cigarettes, and so I have been vehemently opposed to all forms of tobacco usage since I began working in the hospital. There is nothing more painful than watching someone go really slowly and painfully, and this is what happens to almost all smokers who come into our hospital. Not only does smoking have immediate impacts upon your short-term health, it also really affects the last years of your life. What might have been otherwise tolerable aches and pains from old age will instead become excruciating injuries and exhausting diseases. I think that they should even go so far as to make a rule that would make it illegal to smoke at any public place. I know that smokers have rights and they are people just like everyone else, but they do not have enough respect for human life to make decisions of this nature. I really hope that the world as a whole will take a more serious stance against smoking, and I hope that as part of this, the poor people of Japan who are subjected to cigarette smoke will also find some solace.
