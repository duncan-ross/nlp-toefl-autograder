I'm one of the none-smoking people and sometimes I am angry with a insensible deed that those who have smoked lots of days is biting a cigarette around a lot of people in the place like bus station, restaurant, what else. While rather my mine likes this, how about our whole nation thinking of smoking in the public place? I guess it is not different. How think about in the Restaurant, as presenting essay topic to me. Nothing of speaking of, the extensive people object to smoking in the restaurant no matter who they do. But it is definitely needed to change our mine. All of the people obtain The Liberty, which during the many decades we have sought, and finally have reached with over much blood, war, sacrifice, effort, heavy pain and burden or so. In other words, the smokers is having the right that they can definitely smoke everywhere they want and no matter who someone are dare not interfere with. Existing like this situation, The Restaurant is classified as Possible-smoke-place and None-smoke-place. Therefore, just select your taste about the place to meal with. That's why I can't feel like needing the ban of smoking in the restaurant.
