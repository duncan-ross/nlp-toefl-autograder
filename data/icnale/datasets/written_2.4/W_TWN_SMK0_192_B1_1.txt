In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. Especially in the restaurant, there is a lot of food, it will imminently in people's mouth; therefore, smoking in the restaurant is the worst influence to people's health! From most people's perspective, the drawbacks of totally banning cigarette smoking in restaurants outweigh its benefits. Smoking is a health issue and it should be prohibited. The problem is, in spite of its terrible effects on health, quite a lot of people take up this dangerous habit. The number of smokers is increasingly large, so they can affect public opinion and the economy. If we totally ban smoking right now, not considering the smokers, things may get out of hand. The only thing we can do now is to ban smoking step by step, beginning with a partial ban and then a total ban. Publicity and education are also indispensable to show smokers and non-smokers the lethal nature of cigarette smoking.
