Hong Kong Government is now to completely ban smoking in all of the restaurants. In my opinion, I think it is a great measure made by Hong Kong Government. The reasons are as follows, First, smoking banning is good measure to help people have a healthy body. As smoking will emit some gases which harm other people when they inhale these gases from the first hand smoking. As people absorb these second-hand smoking, people will be harmed by these gases which will affect their lungs and make them suffered from cancer. Also, this measure can boost the profit of the restaurants as the environment of the restaurants become better. People will come into the restaurants to consume and will stay longer to eat. This may left a good image in the costumers' brain. So the reputation of the restaurants will become better rather than the day before the measure imposed. To conclude, I think smoking in restaurants completely banned is a good measure in Hong Kong. This can make Hong Kong become a healthy, clean city from other nation people images. Also, restaurants in Hong Kong can earn more under this measure.
