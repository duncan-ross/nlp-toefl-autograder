Recently, an issue of smoking prohibition in public area has been debated as a hot topic. In my opinion, smoking in public area especially when it is restaurant, should be prohibited because of the following two reasons. First of all, smoking is bad not only for smoker's health, but also for non-smoker's health. There are many research studies that have been conducted regarding to the relationship between smoking and health problem like lung cancer or larynx-linked disease. For example, nicotine or tar which is one of the most harmful ingredients included in tobacco, is well known to cause a serious cancer or disease to the non-smokers who inhale those things through secondary smoking as well as the smoker himself. Non-smokers have right to decide whether or not keep themselves from exposing towards the smokers. Secondly, smoking in all the restaurants should be banned because there also are many children among the people who visit the restaurants. It is pretty well known that children, unlike adults, are more likely to be affected by the secondary smoking. In case of family restaurants, problems are more serious than the normal restaurants. They should be not exposed to an unwanted smoking which can harm their health in a disastrous way. In conclusion, smoking in all public area, including restaurants should be prohibited for the other non-smokers. We should not disregard the non-smokers' rights to maintain their lives and surroundings as clean and fresh as possible. Banning all the smoking in all the restaurants should be executed immediately.
