Having a part-time job is one of the best things college students do to help prepare themselves for their futures. It is well known that students to graduate from college with no work experience have an extremely tough time finding employment, and along with this, the employment which they can find is not as lucrative or as engaging as a work that can be found if they only had some work experience. Almost everyone in the world will have to work at some point in their lives, so why not get started as early as possible. I do think that college students should focus most of their time on learning, but it is very easy to find a place that will allow you to work with a flexible schedule so that you can stay focused on your studies. Furthermore, if you're like me and have been going to school for a long time or are pursuing an advanced degree, you will inevitably have to work in order to make enough money to live and eat. Except for a few rare cases of kids that have extremely wealthy parents, most students will need to work in order to support either their living situation or their entertainment.
