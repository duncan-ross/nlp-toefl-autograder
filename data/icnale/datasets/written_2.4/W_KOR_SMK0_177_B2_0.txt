Smoking has been an issue for a long time already. There is no question that cigarettes are only good for doing harm, but banning smoking at all the restaurants is not a good idea. Rather it's good or not, it is one of the favorite foods. Before we unconditionally ban smoking and advocate non-smoker, we also need to consider the smoker's right. It would be good if there are seats for smokers only. To separate the seats into two kinds, for smoker and non-smokers, can be one solution which is already happening in Korea. If you visit caf辿 or restaurants, you can easily find the seats separated. I think this is the better idea than banning smoking all the areas at restaurants. And it is also good to make a smoking area outside of the restaurants buildings so that the people can smoke and non-smokers don't get harmful effect. My opinion is that we don't have the right to stop smokers so smoking should be allowed. But a guideline or a condition must be followed which is saying "Smoker should not affect non-smoker. " If this condition is kept, I think it is find to leave them smoke. Their health is their responsibility.
