I cannot agree more that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In high school we have no time to do a part-time job. We must study everyday in order to enter a better university. But as a college student, do some part-time job is good for us. Here I have three reasons to support my view of point. First, taking a part-time job, we can make money, so we can buy something we like. It can bring us the extra pocket money and cultivate your independence. Just economy independence is the true independence. Second, we can make friends in a part-time job, share our happiness and sadness with others. The third reason is the most important one. Part-time jobs can broaden our vision and we can practice ourselves, develop our interpersonal skills from various social practice, improve abilities and lay a foundation of the social work. Of course, it's in the foundation of you have free time. It depends on your character, your condition of life and your major, I think. If you are a person who like to study and research and you are not worrying about the tuition and your major is something like math and science, you'd better focus on the study. A part-time job is only a supplement which gives you a kind of rest.
