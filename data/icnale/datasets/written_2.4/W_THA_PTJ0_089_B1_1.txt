A part time worker is someone who work fewer hours that a full- time worker. College costs are high that money is needed now more that ever. So time management will be useful. Student who work could better time management that student who are not employed. Student who work have new friend and built friendship may find it helpful from work more than ever. Teenagers with job will learn to better communicate with people and they can lean about of the employer. They still could learn about information. During working hours, Student who interesting part time should be decide do it on summer because it will not side effect to education. School is full-time job which we should be learn for work in the future but some people don't have enough money, they might be look for work that good and earning money for cost of living, but be careful, study might fall down if you can a good time management you will succeed in study and work together. However, It effect for me too. It is I no have a free time for relax to be equal with friend but I don't care. Many time, I always go to bed early because I have homework and I must repeat the reason everyday. I'm tired but I do. So, working is good bad for me. I should to share of the time, to do bests for everything.
