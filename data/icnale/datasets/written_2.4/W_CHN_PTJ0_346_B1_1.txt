Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? As I see, maybe the answer is "yes". Because the significance of part-time job is very clear to see. Don't you believe? Ok, now, let me give you some in brief. As the first of it, the part-time job is a job. So you can get reward if you do it carefully. Every time I get the salary in the end of month, I am always feeling so excited for it is exchanged with the sweat of mine. Don't think the money you earned is too little and isn't worth to mention. As I know, part-time jobs for students are very worth for in fact you didn't create much value. And at the same time, you never spend much time on it. Meanwhile, you can get much experience from it. For example, as you work, you are gradually learning how to communicate with the boss and how to cooperate with other workers. More importantly, it's a very difficult-getting chance to learn to deal with these problems you come across when you work. And for you are a student, anyone else will patiently teach you how to solve these problems. But when you really begin to work, no one will be willing to waste time to teach you. The last and the most important is that you can get into the society through this way. And then you will gradually to see the society through and try your best to adapt to it. Some time later, you will find the ability of society-communicating has a great improvement. So, why we don't have a part-time job right now?
