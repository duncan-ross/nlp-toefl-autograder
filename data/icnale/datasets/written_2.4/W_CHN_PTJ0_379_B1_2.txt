When asked about whether college student should have a part-time job in their leisure time, people's perspectives diverge considerably. From my point of view, i hold the idea that the benefits of doing part-time job overshadow the risks of it. Among countless factors which contribute to my standpoint are the following reasonable ones. Initially, doing part-time job will expand one's horizon and enrich one's knowledge. There are many things we cannot learn from our books and studies. in part-time job. Not only can it deepen your understanding of your major, but also it can accumulate experience for your future job. Due to the accelerating rate of college graduate, the competition in employment get more ruthless and relentless. so it is crucial for gaining the job to have a woke experience. Secondly, it is self-evident that doing part-time job can abbreviate our parent's burden on affording our studies. The average fee of the Chinese college is around 10 thousand yuan, which is relatively high for most Chinese families. I can think of no better exemplification and illustration of Hong Zhanhui, owning the honor of :THE MOST MOVING PERSON IN CHINA,, He came from a poor family, so poor that he cannot finish his college only depending on his family. It is doing some part-time jobs in his leisure time that allow him to sail through his college. It is college that helped him out of the poverty and gave him a opportunity to achieve his wild dream. Admittedly, doing part-time job, to some extent, will adversely affect the normal study. It will make you feel harder to concentrate on class, make you get tired easily and make you have less time in studying. However, the benefits of doing part-time job overshadow the risks of it. So I reinforce my standpoint that it is beneficial for us college students doing some part-time job in the leisure time.
