I think that part time work is good. It gives us experience in life. We also take pride in ourselves. We can bring money to the families we have as well as to know the value of money. It is not difficult to find work that allows us to meet more people. We should start to find jobs that we like to do or happy to do. Some jobs may pay in a very low rate but many students are happy to do because they can meet people, they can dress very nicely, and they can gain job experience from a very famous place. For example, some of my friends are working in Japanese restaurants, or brand-name ice cream shops such as Svensens. They all are very happy even they earn not too much money but they say they like to wear the shop's dress and like to give services to people. They say they are very patients since they have a part time job. They have to understand the needs of customers and always clam down if someone complains. This is just example of good effects from part time job. We will know better than other if we have more views is what I want to add.
