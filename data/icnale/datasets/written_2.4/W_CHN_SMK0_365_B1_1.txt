In the old times, smoking is maybe the symbol of aged, cultured men. Now, with the widespread planting of tobacco, every grown-ups especially male, are tend to smoke. Some of them are addict to cigarettes, so they smoke everywhere, including in public places. However, I think smoking in public places should not be allowed. First, smoking is not a good manner to others, if you always pouring out smelly smoke while others feel sick, you must be unpopular. Secondly, smoking now mainly plays the role in social interaction, not just make someone feel satisfied. Also, cigarette has a lot of harmful chemicals that will hurt your body. Every cigarette box has a sign reminding you not to smoke too much outside. In public places, people need a quiet, comfortable environment. Smoking can make one excited like coffee do, to some extent. So smoking can affect all people around you and have a bad influence. That's why I oppose to smoking in public. I think every public place should have a smoking area. This action can not only release the smokers' pressure, but also create a good environment in public places, like the old saying goes Kill two birds with one stone.
