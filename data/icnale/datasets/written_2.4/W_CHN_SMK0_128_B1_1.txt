 I hate the smell of the cigarettes. As a result of this, I support all the smoking-forbidden activities, though some of my families have the bad habit of smoking. This time is no exception, either. I positively agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking not only does harm to the smokers, but also leaves a bad influence on the people around them-we just call those "second-hand smokers". Restaurants are the places where people eat food. If someone else smokes here, the other people in the restaurant just become the second-hand smokers. They always "eat" the smoke into their body while they are having the food. As we all know, smoke is harmful, especially to the children and the pregnant women. Restaurants are the public places, so the government should take the benefits of all the people into consideration. What's more, smoking while eating is a behavior that lacks respect for others. For the smokers own, they will give a terrible impression on the rest of the people. And the more serious consequence is that you may ruin your figure which you set up carefully. I guess that the people who are used to smoking have a completely different idea. They might think smoking-banned in the restaurants harms their rights. What we can do for this is to set aside a room as smoking room for smokers. However, all in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I will always be on this side.
