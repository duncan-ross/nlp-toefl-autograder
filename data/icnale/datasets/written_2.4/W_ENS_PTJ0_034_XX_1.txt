I wish that I had enough time to have a part-time job, but I am way too busy with my schoolwork to even think about getting started in something that would only drain my time and detract from the intense focus which is required for my studies. I am an MCDB major, so I think I have a lot more homework than other kids on campus. A lot of my friends have part-time jobs and they seem to enjoy them quite a lot, and it really makes me feel bad that I have so much work that I cannot even have just a few hours per week to make a little bit of money and have a little bit of fun. Hopefully, after I graduate from college, I can find a very good job, but I am also worried that with no work experience I really might have my work cut out for me, no pun intended. The economy is pretty bad right now everywhere in the world, so it may be difficult for the current generation of college graduates to find employment after their graduations. Therefore, I think that college student should have a part-time job in order to help them gain experience which will help them later.
