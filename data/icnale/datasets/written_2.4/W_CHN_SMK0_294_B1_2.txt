In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public places. As we all know, smoking is harmful to people' health. Cigarettes contain a lot of poisonous things that if a baby swallows one, it is likely to die and that the boiled water from a bunch of them makes an effective insecticide. Once people are hooked by cigarettes, they will take the risk of suffering pneumonia and even lung cancer. They are all horrible deadly diseases. Smoking has become an important killer along these years. So I do not support the idea that smoke in public places. Apart from the harm it does to people's health, the fact that smoking pollutes the environment of public places is another important reason. Obviously, there are many kinds of people gather in public places. Some places like pubs, hospitals, there are a lot of people there and the air can not cycle easily. I have had the experience so I know the bad feeling taking breath of the smoke other people breathe out. It affect my mood greatly. In a row it can affects the efficiency of work. When you smoke in public places, may be you are comfortable, while others are suffering. Based on the reasons above, so I think smoking should be forbidden in public places. A law which limits smoking should be passed so that we can get fresh air back in public places.
