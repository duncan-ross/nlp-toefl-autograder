There is no doubt that smoking is not healthy. People who are unconscious, however, smoke in the public place like the restaurant. So the behavior influences people's feeling and cause some complaint. In their view, we should ban smoking in the restaurant. In my opinion, I'm in favor of banning smoking in the restaurant too. Some reasons will explain my idea. As we all know, the restaurant is a public place to enjoy ourselves. It doesn't only belong to those smoking person. Of course, you can smoke, it's your right, but you can consider firstly other's feelings. Second-hand smokers suffer more harmful than those smokers. Worse more, there are all kinds of person, such as children, the old people, some pregnant women and so on, are in the restaurant having their meals. The smell of cigarettes must have negative effect on them. Originally, we can have a good time with our family to have a dinner. Finally, we cannot enjoy ourselves due to smoking in the restaurant. If you can't help smoking, you can smoke outside, I believe no one can disturb and prevent you. Thus, the smokers enjoy and the others can enjoy their dinners. After the ban of smoking in the restaurant, everyone will be happy to have their dinners in the restaurants.
