I do not think that it is very important for college students to have part-time jobs, unless the student really needs the money for his / her study or family. I think a student should concentrate on studying rather than having part-time jobs. Students go to college to be full-time students instead of working full-time is because they can learn some useful skills that will help them find better jobs in the future if they go to college. They can make more money and have more professional experiences from those better jobs more easily than from part-time jobs. Besides, if a student spends too much time on having part-time jobs, he / she would have no time for study, which is the very basic way to learn those useful skills, and may be kicked out of college because of bad grades. Then the student loses not only the chance to learn useful skills but also the chance to benefit from those skills by using them during working; that is a pity for the student. Therefore, unless the student needs money to support his / her study or family, I do not agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.
