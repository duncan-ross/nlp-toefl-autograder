Is important for college students to have a part-time job? What the part-time job is so important for most college student? These are good questions for nowadays college students. In my opinion, I think the part-time job is very important for the college student for the following reasons. The first reason is that the student can learn the job experiences. About eighty to ninety percent of college in Taiwan when they graduated they should be find out their job. If they had the job experiences, it will be better than other who didn't have any job experience. And when the college student in the part-time job, they also learn something that don't teach in the class. I thought the second reason is that the college student can find out which job is suitable for him in his part-time job. Most students who didn't worked before after they graduated they will spend long time to find out what kind of job is suitable for him or whether they can have interest in the job. I think this is a very important, because most people just work for work or the money. If they are no interest in the job, not only is very tough for him, it also make lower the job appearance. And the college student if they have the part-time job, they will know which job is more suitable for them and it is also save the time to looking for the job when they graduate. In conclusion, I think the part-time job is so important for the college student for these two reasons, to get the experience and find out the job interest. For these two reasons, I strongly believe that the part-time job is benefit for the college student, and is good for their future job.
