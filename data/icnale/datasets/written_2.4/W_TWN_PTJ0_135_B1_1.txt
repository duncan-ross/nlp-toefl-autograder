In my opinion, it is important for college student to have apart-time job. For college students, they should learn both the knowledge in the class and lesson in the life. Most college students are already an adult. If an adult still can't earn the money to support his or her life, it would be difficult for him or her to fit in the society. For college students, they should have enough ability to support their life and they have to take the responsibility for their own life. When they want to buy something new, they should try to get the things by their own effort, rather than make a phone call to their parents and say: "Hello! Dad, Mom, I want to buy some clothes and can you give me the money? " Some say that if college students have part-time job, the job will occupy the study time; other say that the high salary will also make students earn the money rather than go to school. However, as what I mentioned before, knowledge in the class and lesson in the life are even important, and college student should take the responsibility for their own life. If a student makes a bad score in the school, he should realize that maybe he should give up his job and concentrate on studying; and that is also a kind of lesson. Part-time job is important but not necessary for every college students. However, what make part-time job important is not the job's salary but what can you learn from the job: how to have conversation with the costumer, how to do your job more efficiently, or how to deal with the sudden-happened situation. In short, a part-time job is important for college student because you'll have the experiment helping you in the future.
