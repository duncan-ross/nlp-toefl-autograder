Recently some researches show that smoking is not only bad to the smoker himself, but also people around him, which arouse public's attention, especially those non-smokers. Walking along the street, you can speed up and overtake who are blowing a cloud. In a taxi cabin or on a bus, you can crank the window and ventilate. However, suppose you are sitting in a restaurant, waiting your meal with expectation and a person, just sits on the next table, enjoying inspiriting and aspirating, what will you do? You feel uncomfortable, annoyed, and angry. But unfortunately you can find little to do. I have gone through such dilemma, so I strongly agree that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurant is a place where we order and enjoy palatable food. We change our money for chef's elaborate skills, exciting visual and tongue experience, even good health. Usually smoking restrains your appetite. More cigarettes, less degustation. Definitely it isn't worthy of what you have paid. It means waste of time and money. So first of all, I suggest those who prefer smoking on a table put out lighter and take up the dishware. On the other hand, since you are in a public area, you are bound to take other people into consideration. Smoking, this behavior, has a unique form – smoke, which floats everywhere without boundaries and has impact on others. A smoker may claim smoking is his or her private right. If it is, they should do that in their private place like sitting room or balcony. Everybody knows smoking is bad for health, including those heavy smokers. The problem is that they have formed a habit that can be hardly gotten rid of. Banning smoking in restaurants is an option to create a harmonious situation and relationships among people. Although it seems not a positive way, I still uphold it.
