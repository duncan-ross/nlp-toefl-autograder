Having a part-time job is a useful way for college students to get a taste of working life aside from the school life that occupies much of their life. Keeping the context of this discussion to Singaporean students since the author, I am of that origin and can best speak for them with full comprehension, having experienced that stage myself. It is often touted that school education prepares and equips us with the knowledge and skills necessary for the "real" world, in this sense the working world. However, it can be argued that an academic education is unable to fully prepare us for the working world since a successful future career cannot be directly measured by one's academic capacity. Hence, by taking a part-time job in an industry that one is preferably interested in is a good way taking a first-hand look at the intrinsic characteristics of working in such an industry. Possibly, one can figure out his/her own suitability or discover his/her forte in this industry. For reasons other than life-planning purposes, one could also take on a part-time job just for the fun of it. Perhaps there are certain jobs that you are curious to undertake but are not within your realistic expectations for the future in considering its monetary remuneration and career prospects. Furthermore, taking on a part-time job also teaches us one of the harsh realities of the "real" world: that money is hard-earned. Given the different family backgrounds and upbringing of all college students, this hard inevitable truth may not be reinforced enough. In considerations of these reasons, it is not really mandatory but is encouraged that college students to take on a part-time job as they should also kick back and relax during the vacation period for the future endeavours ahead.
