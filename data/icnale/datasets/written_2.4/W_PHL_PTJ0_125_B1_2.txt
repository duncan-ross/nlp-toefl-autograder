I agree that it is necessary for students to have a part time job. Based on what I have observed nowadays here in our country students are the most common to search a part time jobs especially when summer vacation comes. Instead of staying at home many students decides to have it to help their parents in gaining money for the purpose of their tuitions. Having a part time job is a big help to an ordinary student especially to those who are unfortunate but still doing and finding a way to finish their degrees or ambitions in life, students can pay for their education and thus will value their education even more. There are many benefits also that a student could earn having a part time job because it can foster a sense of competition, which is important for students in the future. It enhances a young person's social development. Part-time jobs can help students apply their knowledge in practice and, in return, their experience will make them know better what they have learned in classes and books. A job can help students better develop their identities, obtain increased autonomy, achieve new accomplishments, develop work experience, and become more independent from their parents. Aside from that with the money earned, students can buy many books they like, they can even buy clothes or other material needs without bothering a help with their parents and in that way it is lessens for the expenses of the family. For college students having a part time job provides students work experience and it can help to look good their resumes. Having a job while studying is great, aside from you are earning you are capable of gaining some benefits from it that could be very useful when you finish your pursued degrees.
