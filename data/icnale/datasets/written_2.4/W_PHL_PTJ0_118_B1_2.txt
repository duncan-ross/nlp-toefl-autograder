I do not think it is important for a college student to have a part time job. The immediate responsibility of a college student is to his/her studies. I believe that having a part-time job has its perks and advantages such as learning about responsibility and commitment and earning extra money to put into their savings, but having a part-time job also has certain disadvantages that outweigh its advantages. One disadvantage is that it takes up the time of the student. Having a part-time job commits the student to his/her employer. The implication of this is that the student has no choice but to attend to his/her employer. This will give the student less time to focus on his/her studies. Other than that, it tires the student physically and mentally. Usually, college students are given night shifts for their part-time jobs, since they have classes during the day. In a country like the Philippines, where it is difficult to get from one place to another and where the traffic situation is horrendous, you can only imagine the effort it will take to get to school, get to your workplace, then get back home very late. This adds stress to the student and may make him/her inefficient in studies and in work.
