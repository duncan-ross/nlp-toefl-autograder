Some smokers claim that it is unfair it all restaurants banned smoking, restaurants shall provide some places for smoking. I totally disagree with their opinion. I am going to express my opinion on completely banned of smoking. First, banning smoking completely at restaurant can lead them to give up smoking. As smoking harm smokers' bodies. Carbon monoxide reduce the oxygen in the blood, smokers will feel dizzy. Tar is carcinogenic substances. Thus, if smokers go dining out, they will smoke less so that their bodies can be improved. Besides, allowing smoking in the restaurant partly will affect other people. Smokers may say that the restaurants can segment a part as smoking zone. However, as the restaurants are using central air-conditioner, the harmful substances will spread out though the air adjusting system. Second-hand smoking harms people more because they do not have a filter. As a result, smokers cannot avoid harming other innocent people, people who do not smoke will suffer from these smokers. To conclude, smoking should be banned completely, it can help both smokers and non-smokers. If they can stop smoking in the restaurant, as time goes by, smoker will get rid of tobacco. The world will be cleaner and cleaner.
