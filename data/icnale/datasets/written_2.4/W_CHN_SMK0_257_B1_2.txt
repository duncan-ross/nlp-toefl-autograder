 No smoking! is a slogan which has been spoken for a long time, but a complete prohibition of smoking is a dream hard to come true. Considering the bad effects of smoking, I am strongly for the proposal to ban smoking at least in some areas---for example---the restaurants. First of all, smoking in restaurant may cause bad impact on the business. Restaurant is a place where people go to enjoy food and have some relax, and as a result, besides the food and service, the atmosphere and the environment of it is an important factor in choosing a restaurant. For those non-smokers, it is unbearable to sit in a smoky area for an hour or more since the air is polluted, not to mention to have a good appetite. What's more, non-smoking customers, which is a large portion in the population, will refuse to have dinner in it, which is a great loss to the restaurant. Secondly, smoking in public places like restaurants raises a severe problem of second-hand smokers. As is shown in the medical research, second-hand smokers are more likely to get lung-cancer than people who really smoke. In restaurant, the smoke of one cigarette will spread across the whole room, thus bringing potential danger to health of all the staff and customers. That's a big problem. In the world people live longer and happier, smoking is really a great obstacle to improve the quality of people's lives. Consideration the above obvious bad impacts of smoking, we should ban smoking from our life---from the basic level(eating environment)---ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
