 As we all know, smoking is becoming a widespread habit in the whole world today. We can see all kinds of people smoke on street or on bus or wherever they want. Some of them even smoke in restaurants. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I think the answer is yes. There is no doubt that smoking does harm to our health and we all know that smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. But why so many people still smoke like chimneys? The reason varies from person to person. Some people may think it cool with a cigarette between their lips. Some may smoke just out of curiosity. And some may smoke to refresh themselves. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves but also a great threat to others. When we smoke in the restaurant, we unconsciously do harm to others at the same time. We should think for others so we shouldn't smoke in restaurant. On the other hand, when we eat in restaurant, we will feel awful if others are smoking. So we can't have a good mood to enjoy our meals. Imagine we are in a restaurant full of smokes, which must be very bad! And smoking at restaurant is often regarded as a bad manner. If we want to enjoy our meal, smoking must be banned! In a word, smoking does a lot of harm to smokers and non-smokers. It must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
