 Last year ago, New York declared a severe order about stop smoking in the world, people are banned smoke in public places, which include bars, restaurants, offices, auditorium, and so on. It's said that the order in order to protect services health. No matter who is protected, we know that smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. Especially at restaurants, if one person smoke, others may breathe in and eat (smoke may fall on food) smoke, so our lunges and stomach will be polluted, it's like that we do passive smoking two times. I think you can imagine the disadvantage that people smoke at restaurant. When you go restaurant with a smoker, and the smoker spit the smoke on food which is your favorite, what do you think then? In my opinion, I will suffer from lack of appetite. We may have a try to put ourselves in smokers' shoes, they may don't want to smoke at restaurant, but they usually can't control their craving for tobacco, and now we can help they stop the desire of smoking, it's not only protect our health, but also help smokers. In my view, everyone has the right to choose his/her own way of life, but one does not have the right to impose his way of life on other people. So smoking in public places should be banned.
