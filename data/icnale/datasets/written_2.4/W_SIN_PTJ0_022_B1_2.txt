Although there are merits of having a part time job while schooling at a college level, I believe that the focus of students should primarily be their studies. Working a part-time job can be very beneficial as youngsters learn various skills like responsibility, hard work, team work and perseverance. It also gives them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth because they would be earning money entirely by themselves. This makes them independent because they would no longer require to merely rely passively on their parents for allowance to meet their daily expenses. Working a part-time job would also enable young people to understand the value of money and learn to appreciate it. This cultivates a good habit of thrift which would be useful for them in the future when they are accountable for their own financial matters. Working also helps students to not take things for granted especially since they would experience first-hand how it feels to work for money. However despite these benefits, I strongly believe that students should ultimately divert a significant amount of attention to their academic endeavours simply because it is only pragmatic to do so. Especially in a meritocratic country like Singapore, hard work in school translates to qualifications that would render one more successful in their careers in the future. Financial stability should take precedence and therefore, students should not waste their precious revision time on being employed while they are schooling.
