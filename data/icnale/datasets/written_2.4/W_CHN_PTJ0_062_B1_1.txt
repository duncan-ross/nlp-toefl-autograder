In summer holiday, several friends of mine chose to take a part time job. Imaging that you delivering some advertisement, standing in the store smiling to welcome people or serving people in a restaurant in the hot summer day. I prefer to take a part time job thought feeling tired and facing trouble. As a college student now, I have been able to burden duty in law. Though my family supports me to finish my studying in school, i still want to burden duty of paying partly for the school fees. To the majority of college students, the school fees are too high to pay. If you plan to set, aslo choose a suitable job for yourself. It's obvious that the competition in society is more intense than before. Even other position of a cleaner can attract thousands of graduates. Let alone other jobs with high salary. Higher the salary, higher the standard. What should you do before landing a good job according to a survey about job in Daily China, more than half of the sample prefer to take a part job, for two benefits, firstly, you an acquire a general knowing of particular job and the steps or the strategies to do well. Secondly, you can experience totally different daily life. It can also good your CV. In my opinion, taking a part time job can helps as adjust ourselves to the society and earn some extra money. All in all, don't judge from the salary or your favorite, choose the suitable job depending on your goal and strength.
