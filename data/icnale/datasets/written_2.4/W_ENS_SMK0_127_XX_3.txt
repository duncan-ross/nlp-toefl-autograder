Smoking is not nearly as socially acceptable as it once was. In days gone by, most men smoked in Japan. These days, however, smoking is becoming less and less acceptable as the risks involved with smoking become better understood. As a result of this, there has been much pressure to curb the amount of smoke that pollutes the air in public places. I agree that smoking should be severely restricted in restaurants. The reason for this is the danger of secondhand smoke. Smoking does not just hurt the person who is smoking a cigarette; it also pollutes the air and is inhaled by people around the smoker. Studies have shown that secondhand smoke can cause cancer. Therefore, you can get cancer from the smoking of other people even if you do not smoke yourself. The upshot of this is that whenever you go out in public and people are smoking around you, you run the risk of being exposed to secondhand smoke and therefore potentially developing cancer later in life. Thus you should be able to go to restaurants without being exposed to this danger. There are other reasons that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. The smoky atmosphere in a restaurant that allows smoking can make people inside the restaurant stank of cigarette smoke even if they don't smoke themselves. Also, some people are allergic to cigarette smoke and would have a bad reaction if they were to be exposed to it. Therefore, I definitely think that smoking in restaurants in Japan should be banned. People should be able to go to whatever restaurant they desire without having to worry about being exposed to secondhand smoke that could cause cancer, ending up speaking of cigarette smoke, or being exposed to the risk of suffering from an allergic reaction. Because of all these reasons, smoking should be eliminated from public restaurants in the country.
