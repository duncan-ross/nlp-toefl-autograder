I think that it is important for us to have a part time job. College fee has been very high recently in the case of national college. It is not to say in the case of private college. If students live alone, in addition to this fee, they need to pay a house rent and food cost and so on. And if brothers or sisters of students enter colleges, their parents are imposed on heavy burden. So we should help our parents in the part of financial. We learn the human relationships from having a part time job. Particularly relationships with senior people are very precious. If we do not have a part time job, we do not have an opportunity to communicate with, for example, ten senior people. Communication with senior people is essential for us because when we get a job two year later, most of people are senior to us. And we learn a right way of speaking by serving customers. We learn the hardship to get money. In these reasons part time job is profitable experience for us as a preparation of entering adult society. In the view of earning money and cultivating humanity part time job is important.
