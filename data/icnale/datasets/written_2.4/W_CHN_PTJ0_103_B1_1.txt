Nowadays, many college students in foreign countries choose to take a part time job. However, most Chinese college students are still prone to pay little attention to doing part jobs and focus only on their major study. In my opinion, the pros of doing part time jobs overweigh its cons. I have mainly four reasons for it. In the first place, doing part jobs is a symbol of being independent which means you are no more a child and you can take good care of yourself. Second, you can learn quite a lot from the job. It will help you broaden your horizons, gain more experiences and get more close to the society. As a saying goes that experience is the best teacher, the meaningful experiences will make you adjust to the society much better and will benefit you the whole life. Third, as we all know time is limited and valuable in college and doing a part time job is often in conflict with studying. Hence, taking a part job will force you to know how to balance your work and study and how to use time to the fullest. Last but not least, if you take a part time job, you will get a sum of money which can be used to cover tuition and purchase whatever you want. What's more it will also teach your how to handle and manage your money. In conclusion, although learning is our main task and doing part job will take much time, it benefits us quite a lot. From my point of view, universities and college students should make join efforts to advocate college students to take a part time job.
