In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all in the restaurants in the country. I will explain it in the below. For one thing, as we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. According to the number of statistics, smoking is one of the biggest killers to the human being's health. Every one of us including the smokers should spare no effort to resist the cigarette. Therefore, banning smoking is absolutely right. For another, smoking bring harms to not only the smoker himself but also the people around him, that is to say, the people all around the smokers have to pay their health !Why? This is unfair! Taking that the restaurant is a public place into consideration, the smoking will do harms to more people! The restaurant is a public place and there are all kinds of people including the children. I think nobody wants to answer the children's question that "Why they do smoking? Should I do the same thing? Why?"If you were smoking in the restaurant and there was a kid asking you the question, how and what will you say? Without any doubts, both of the kid's body and psychology are affected. In a word, if we are blind to the problem, smoking in the restaurant will do more and more harms to our society. It's the high time for us to take actions!
