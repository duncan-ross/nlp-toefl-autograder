Smoking, as we all know, is detrimental to health but there are some people sticking to this hobbit. It causes several diseases into our body and makes our longevity shorter. Smoking in restaurants is a disruption to everyone's meal, not just the smokers. The dividers that restaurants owners provide do not keep the smoke from spreading to non-smoking areas. The smokers do not worry about the smoke because they have a filter and have made the choice to smoke. Most of the time smokers do not even notice the smoke; they have become immune to smell of smoke. Without the filter, the non-smokers end up taking in more toxins than smokers do. Ventilation along with dividers may be a way to solve the smoke problem. The dividers placed between smoking and non-smoking areas do not provide a good enough barrier Latest research shows that the banning of smoking in restaurants has reduced heart attacks by as much as a fifth. In all the studies it was observed that the restaurant smoking ban had had a direct effect. After the ban there was an immediate reduction in the number of heart infarct victims admitted to hospitals. Beginning 2004 many countries have banned smoking in restaurants. Norway and Ireland were among the first. This is also evident in the reduction of heart attacks. It has been estimated that 400 000 people have given up smoking altogether after restaurant smoking was banned in England in July last year. The ban has been calculated to prevent 40 000 deaths during the next 10 years. Irish researchers have pointed out that the ban on smoking has raised the quality of music in restaurants. Banning smoking in restaurants has thus proven an excellent measure for keeping clean various pipes in musical instruments as well as in humans.
