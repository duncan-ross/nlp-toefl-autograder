In my opinion, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job. Most students study in college for specific reasons. When it comes to the word "college, " we know it is the place where we gain further knowledge in a distinct field from. Some of us bury themselves into the academic, spending the most of their time trying to figure out something new or significant; however, most of the college students regard here as the place where we learn something more - the skills and abilities that would be required after we graduate, starting to find a job. What are the required skills then? Specific work position needs specific background knowledge and basic, even professional ability, such as accounting, management... etc. Along with the abilities above, great communication and social skills are also the crucial elements that make us good employees in the future. How do we learn these skills if they are not taught by any professors in our schools? Having a part-time job might be the best way. In a safe and not-so-complex working environment, students can learn how to deal with problems that are trickier than their math essays, and how to communicate with their supervisors or colleagues. In addition, since the part-time job is merely a part of a busy college student's life, they have to make the most of their limited time, they have to be more efficient, and they have to decide what their priorities are. To sum up, having a part-time job is a great way for college students to gain some useful experiences. These experiences do not only help us to have a glimpse of the post-graduate working society, but also help us to broaden the horizons and to be more caring.
