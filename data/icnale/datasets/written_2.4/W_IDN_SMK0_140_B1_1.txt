I strongly agree that government have to make ban smoking in restaurant for some reasons. First, smoking not good for our body. There are many poison in cigarette, and it so bad for our body such as, nicotine tar asphalt, etc. They are chemistry elements. If our body brust them it is really hurt for our body, and it can make heart attack. Second, the smoke can disturb everyone that eat in the restaurant. Smoking is dangerous not only for the smokers but for other people around them as well Although we do not smoking, but as a passive smoker there is not difference between passive smoker and active smoker. Passive smoker as a sacrifice as active smoker. Third, the smoke of cigarette in restaurant can make the room so dirty and not healthy. We cannot stay here comfortable. The visitors begin decrease and it make the restaurant lose because of the cigarette's smoke. Fourth, the rule can decrease death risk. Many people get lung cancer because of cigarette smoking and die. The restaurant can help government for support these rule. The restaurant not give chance for smoker to smoke. The restaurant just serve some nice food as the way to life healthy. We can life healthy without smoking.
