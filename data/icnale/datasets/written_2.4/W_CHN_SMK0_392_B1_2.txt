 The smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, is an annoying problem. It is troublesome when you are enjoying your meal and, being a second-hand smoker because of a smoker sitting by. However, is it sensible to ban smoking completely in all restaurants? No. Think about the population of smokers! To prevent them from the dinner table means to cut down the profit of restaurants by half—a quarter, at least—many smokers are wealthy. Since it still remains a problem for these people to quit smoking, and we don't have the right to raid their freedom to eat in a restaurant while many of them cannot live without a cigarette for even one minute, we shouldn't ban smoking completely in all restaurants. Even though we do not ban completely, we have rules and should make it a law that every restaurant should have a corner for those who smoke, and these areas should be where the smoke can be guided directly to outside. In other places of the restaurant, people should not smoke at all. And if anyone does so, he should be strictly punished. If the idea is put into reality, the smokers just go back to their corners, and all the people can enjoy themselves and not be disturbed by the smoke.
