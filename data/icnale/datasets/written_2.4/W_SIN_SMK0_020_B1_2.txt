I agree to a large extent that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are so many health hazards smoking can cost to not only the smoker him or herself but also people around them. A restaurant is for a place to eat and enjoy our food, however, with all the cigarette smells, it can also affect one's appetite. Secondly, innocent passive smokers causes even more harm compared to the first-hand smokers. The exposure of these smoke or tobacco can cause several diseases like lung cancer and in some cases, even death, which shows that it is a potential hazard. These risks are not what the they wanted when they are dining in a restaurant. Thus, it should be banned in restaurants. Besides, doing so can advocate the potential risks of smoking. I find that if smoking were to be completely banned initially, it can arise certain objections. I suggest that there should be a smoking corner or room which is completely seperated from the non-smokers diners who wants to simply enjoy their meals. And overtime, slowly increasing the number of restaurants that ban smoking. Thus, in conclusion, smoking should be completed banned at restaurants due to all the potential health risks posed to smokers and people around them.
