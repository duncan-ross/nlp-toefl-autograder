Chinese government declared that smoking should be completely banned at all the indoor public and commonality vehicles, coupled with me other outdoor working yards, at the mainland after January 2011. But I think it's not good enough to banned smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants in the country are different from other public whose customers usually are farmers. They often go to restaurants for a simple part or when they need to celebrate an event. Cigarettes become a bond of social communication and giving a cigarette shows their friendliness to others. With a cigarette in their hands, they can chat with each other enthusiastically. To some degree, smoking can refresh and relax oneself. Farmers work hard in field and do other jobs to support their families. Being too tied, smoking when chat with friends in the restaurants makes them feel ease. Ban on smoking is the final aim. But this project should be done step by step. Banning smoking completely breaks the farmers' harmony in the restaurant. There will be more depress, misunderstanding and conflicts. Worse still, if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in the country, false smoke will be more rampancy in the country, which can bring more serious damages to peoples' health. It's a huge project to ban smoking and everything should be taken into consideration.
