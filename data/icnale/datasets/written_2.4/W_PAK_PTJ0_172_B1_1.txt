Nobody is perfect in this world and we cannot deny this fact that in our world there were people who were born wealthy. It is a fortunate life if you were born in a wealthy or average family and you get all the luxuries of life and there were born who were not wealthy it is unfortunate life if you were born in a poverty life and deprived all the necessities of life. With the rising population there were many who were in the poverty life and day by day they were struggling to live and find ways to move to the poverty line of life. They had to manage to live and survive in this modern and competitive world. Education would be the biggest challenge of the family in the poverty stage of how are they going to support their children to send them to school. Government schools are cheap and it will be a big opportunity to send their children to school at low cost or affordability. Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words, purpose of education is not educating people only for educating them but the purpose is fit them for life. Education widens our outlook and makes us wise. Part time jobs are a brilliant place to start your work career. It is common for high school students who are just entering the workforce, to start with a part-time job. Part-time jobs are also quite well for individuals who are employed full time, but want to earn extra money, for any number of reasons they do not only continue their studies but also support their families. While they earn pocket money, or money to reduce the cost of their tuition. Part-time jobs should be thought of an opportunity to learn new skills. Many people in fact become not proficient at what they learned through a part-time job, that they choose it as a career and affect their future life.
