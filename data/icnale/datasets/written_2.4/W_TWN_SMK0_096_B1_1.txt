That's true. According science reports, cigarettes content lots of chemical substances that would harm your lungs and even lead to cancers. They also have influences to other parts of body and make you weaker day after day. And two-hand-smoking is much worse to ours health. Thankfully, there are not so many people like to smoke in recent years. The government has also set the law to protect un-smoking people, hoping that smokers can change their habits. The rule is that smokers are not allowed to smoke in public areas anymore, such as offices, train stations and restaurants. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Not only banned for health reason but also give respect to un-smokers. Not everyone can stand that kind of smell. But restaurants can still have smoking room or area for smoker to enjoy both their habits and food. Other public areas also can have the same design for smokers. People in 21st centaury become more polite to other persons and respect each other. That remote the country to improve.
