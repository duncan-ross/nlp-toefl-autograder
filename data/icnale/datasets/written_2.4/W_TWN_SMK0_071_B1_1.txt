Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is not only the slogan or the post in front of the restaurant but also the rule that everybody should be follow. And what are not smoking should be banned at all the restaurants? There are two reasons that can explain why can not smoking at the restaurants. The first one is benefit everybody's health. The smoking is totally not hurt for the person who smokes the cigarette and the smoke is more hurt the other who didn't smoke. I thought it is not very faith for the people who didn't smoke and the smoke is hurt their health. And the restaurant is the public space so it should be banned that people can not smoke at the restaurants. The second reason is for the smell in the restaurant. The restaurant is the place that everyone enjoys their food and it must full of the good smell of food. If some smoke at the restaurant it should be make the air not clean and the smell is not very good for the person to enjoy their dish. So I think smoke at the restaurant is very impolite for other people. Finally, I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This way is not only for the smoker's but also protect other person health.
