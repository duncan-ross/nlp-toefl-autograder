In recent years, mankind achieved a stretch of unusual peace in human history. Stability led to an explosive increase in the number of students studying in. It is common practice for students to have a part-time job when they are going through their university years. I agree on this practice if and only if the part-time job is needed or will help the student in their future career. The most common scenario where a student will need a part-time job is when they need to earn some money to support themselves through their studies. The financial background of different students may vary significantly. For this reason, I am for students to pick up part time jobs to cover for their expenses. However, students must be able to balance the working time with their academic responsibilities in order for the student to do well. Another scenario whereby I will support a student to pick-up part-time job is when it is career-related. It is important for students to make full use of their university time to improve themselves and add-value to their own set of skills. Taking up a part-time career related job will increase the student's chance of getting a good graduate job. It is to me highly recommended Other than the above two reasons, I feel it is not advisable for a student to pick up part time work as the time available should be fully utilize by students to gear for the real world after graduation.
