Smoking in restaurants should be banned, of course thinks. Because I didn't smoking and bodies are worse if neither smoke, nor have an impact on food to go around because of smoking ash, and people are very unpleasant. In addition, there are many children in restaurants. Cigarette smoke is deadly to children. Do not smoke in public places. In the restaurant is even more careful thought. Of course, Smoker will uncomfortable. But I hope to smokers who smoke in their designated places. Of course there are people who cannot do it banned. I'm sorry for them, should be banned smoking in restaurants. Instead of banning, smoking area in the country seems to be nice to make a lot. If so, that would reduce smoking in public places. Non-smoking areas in restaurants, but sometimes people are smoking. Such people are reported to pay the fines. Other countries are a lot of people smoking in the restaurant. Fortunately, our country has banned smoking almost the restaurant. It is basic manners, and smokers will not smoke in the restaurant. And around people, especially for young children to think that smoking should be banned. For this reason, smoking is completely banned in all restaurants in the country, I agree.
