I disagree because college is a lot more difficult than people realize and to graduate is even more difficult than it was just a few short years ago. If students are working in part-time jobs because they need to survive or pay college fees, then that's understandable. If there is no need to pay, then I would say don't work because college is hard enough as it is without adding impossible schedules, heavy workloads or other obligations that only serve to suck up more and more of your time and give you a bucketful of stress. So many of my buddies have held down jobs while attending college and all of them have their own little horror stories to tell. College is a big enough undertaking on its own these days and the pressure to graduate is always on. Leave well enough alone I think and just keep concentrating on your college stuff without adding to it. It's not compulsory unless as I said, you need the money or it might be a short internship which is a different story because you usually do those during your vacation times and they are not some extra curricular activity that sucks up your time and patience.
