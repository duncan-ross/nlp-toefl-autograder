In this recent year, college students have so many problem about their daily life either their study or their daily needs. In Indonesia the university is usually in a big city. The students who lives in a village force to leave their village for the sake of their education. So this condition takes them in a boarding house that they will stay. This also forces them to have a much money to supply their daily needs in their boarding. Therefore, most college students have a part time in job beside their lecturing activities. Job is their solution to supply their daily needs. As a college students, they have to make a balance between studying and their job. Unfortunately, must college students can not do it. They are focusing on their job instead of their studying. This condition takes them in a job thinking. They just think where and when or what time they will get a job. Therefore, their studying score will be bad. When a person gets a job, they will force to have a great power. As a college students, they have to be more clever in managing the time and their health. In fact, most of college students who has a part time in job, they are usually not in a good condition. Their power runs out after having a job. As a result, they will little bit ignore their lecture because they are tired after having a job. In this case, the government have a big role to solve this problem. It can not be ignored to this problem. The government should give more scholarship for poor students, so the college students can focus on their subjects without facing their daily life problem
