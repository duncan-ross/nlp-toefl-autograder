I will explain my opinion about smoking. I have a negative thinking about smoking so, I claim that smoking is handled narcotic crimes. Smoking has a lot of a weak point. There are fifth reasons of this claim. First, smoking can be cause cancer because cigarette has a lot of carcinogen. Carcinogen causes the cancer. Especially, if you smoke, you could get high chance of a lung cancer than nonsmokers. So, smoking is dangerous. Second, many people hate the smoking because the cigarette smell is disgusting smell. When I was a child, I smelled the sickening smell of cigarette. Third, secondhand smoking is a big health hazard than smoker. I heard that secondhand smoke will have chance of a cancer than smoker. Especially, women of secondhand smokers can be infertility. So, secondhand smoking is very terrible. Forth, if you smoke, you could reek dreadfully of tobacco and you can cause a lot of trouble for everybody else. Fifth, smoker will get a tartar buildup and have a foul breath. So smoker will be damage to people. For such a reason, smoking is doing more harm than good. Therefore, smoking is handled narcotic crimes. Smoker has to quit smoking. Then, you will get a health.
