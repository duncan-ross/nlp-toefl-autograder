I think the answer is "yes"! Because when I was a student, I always get "part time" to support my life cost. Because I thought I already became adult so I most do my best and don't let my parents worry! I often do servicer, because my strong skill is solve custom question and make they happy. The most job I like is in "Fridays', because this is America system so if you know all about it, you also can go to work in America. And I also have a chance to talk with foreigh; I always have no opportunity to talk at the school and only increase listening and writing in the class. So I think the place cause me approve. By the way, accentlt I do the "show girl" in Taipei, this is a special experice that I only want do one time. inspite this job can earn much money but the worst is you must wear less and not scare when someone watch your body. By the way, I very like do "pt", because I always learn knowledge at the job and I even think it is very fun. As I study at junior high school until university, I do more than thirty jobs. And I think this is very helpful to my formal job.
