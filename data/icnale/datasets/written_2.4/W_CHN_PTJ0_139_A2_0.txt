Nowadays more and more college students take a part time job in their free time. I think it is good for students to take a part time job. There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, we can gain money from the part time job. Students are always lacking of money we can gain money through our hard-working, it will bring a lot of confidence when we get the money we earn. And we can use the money to buy many things we like. It also reduce our family burden. Second, we can gain experience from the part time job. Nowadays more and more company inquire the employee has the work experience and the part time job can give us that. We can familiar with the society in advance. From part time job, we study many knowledge different from text book knowledge in our universities. So the reasons above all show that it is important for college students to have part time jobs. Finally I strongly recommended college student to take a part time job, we can gain benefits from it. If you have free time, try to look for a part time job from now on.
