Nowadays, more and more college students have a part-time job. Some work as tutors, some work as waiters or waitress in the restaurants; still others work at the convenience stores. They keep part-time jobs not only because it's a good opportunity to prepare for their future career plans but also help them save more money, and they can help their family or be financially independent from their family. In my opinion, however, I don't think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I don't mean that keep a job when they are still students is a bad thing, but I think it is not really necessary and primary. College is such a wonderful place where can preserve the students the advanced information, the diverse knowledge, and the rich learning resources. There are also many college activities which are as important as study that students must not miss. The knowledge, the ability, and the experience of joining activities are the invisible fortune that will help the students a lot in the future. If the college students have a part-time job, maybe they'll too busy to deal with their college stuffs. Keeping a part time job may gain some experience and money, but it possibly make the students lose the time to develop their knowledge and ability, which are more important for a student. For the reason, I think it is not really important for college students to have a part-time job.
