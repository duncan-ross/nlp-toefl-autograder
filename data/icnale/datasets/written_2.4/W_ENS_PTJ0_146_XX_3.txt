I think that it is extremely important. With the economy the way it is now, students need to learn very early that the best chance at success that they have is by taking financial responsibility for themselves as soon as possible. Further, if they want to get ahead, then they also need to get as many skills and as much work experience as they can. Getting a job is not as easy as it used to be and it is very tough in New Zealand at the moment just as it is in many countries. Many companies are simply not hiring and a lot of recruitment programs have been put on hold in the larger corporations. Students also have to expect that they might not get the job that they want as soon as they graduate, but if they had some kind of work experience they would have a good chance at getting some other kind of work in the meantime. They need to be mentally tough and prepared that life might just not fall into place in the way that they expect and have a few alternative strategies rather than just one big plan to land their dream jobs.
