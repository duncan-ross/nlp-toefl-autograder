Restaurants are always supposed to be a place that people can completely enjoy their meals, relaxing their feelings. But let us assume the situation that when you are eating the delicious food. Suddenly, there a man breathes out with the smoke, so you may not want to sit here anymore. Smoking can bother others, and should be completely banned at all the restaurants. China has a large number of smokers. As nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon, they hold the view that smoking should be banned. They complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in public that would greatly harm to their health. As all of us known, smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. And diseases caused by the second-hand smoke are even more serious. Nonsmokers shouldn't be responsible for it, while the smokers should think about more for others. Banning the smoking in the restaurant is to build a better atmosphere for nonsmokers, and also for the smokers, in order to have a good time to eat. It is a problem related to the ethic, which means to consider more about the others' rights, not only thinking for you. Although, there is not a clear law to forbid the behavior, but it counts. It calls for all the people to do something to help!
