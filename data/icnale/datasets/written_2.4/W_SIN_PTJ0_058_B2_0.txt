In my opinion, it is not that important for students to have a part-time job, provided that they have the financial capabilities to do so. The period spent at university is one's last chance of enjoying carefree youth without the responsibilities of being an adult. Being a student has its perks, and being free from selling one's labour is a part of it. After graduation we are plagued with so-called adult responsibilities and are expected to take up these expectations by society. In a usual middle-class setting, we are expected to work hard, pay off student loans and be responsible for our own finances, contributing to the family instead of leeching off our parents. With a whole life time ahead for work, work, and more work, I reckon that it would be good to devote all of our time to school --- taking part in school activities, enjoying the learning process of a subject we enjoy and living up the last few years of reckless youth. Granted, I understand that some might not be so fortunate to enjoy schooling life. In that case, working part-time for extra allowance would be useful and helpful for his / her family. I am sure that many university students are working for extra allowance, or taking a financial load of their families.
