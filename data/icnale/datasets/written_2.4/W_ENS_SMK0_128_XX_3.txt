I do not smoke, and I consider smoking to be a dirty and unpleasant habit. It is also dangerous. However, I think that people should be free to indulge in unpleasant habits and dangerous activities as long as they harm no-one else. I enjoy skiing and mountain-climbing, both of which involve an element of risk, and I do not think they should be banned. Dangerous driving, on the other hand, is rightly illegal. The issue of smoking in public places is more complex. Smoking should be banned in all places of work, as it imposes risks on the employees beyond those that are strictly essential for the job. By analogy, construction workers sometimes have to carry out dangerous tasks, but they should be provided with adequate safety equipment, and should not have to carry out dangerous and inessential tasks. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants that have employees. In the case of restaurants run by a single individual or couple, in the abstract, I think that smoking should be permitted, as the owners and customers are free agents. I certainly think this principle applies in the case of a bar or cafe, as, if someone starts smoking, one can simply drink one's glass of beer or coffee and leave. However, the situation with respect to restaurants is more complicated, as a meal may last an hour or two, so one is committed to that time, and temporarily ceases to be a free agent; one cannot simply leave if someone starts smoking nearby. Therefore, on balance, I would say that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.
