I strongly agree with the idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. First of all, we know smoking really does harm to a person's health. Smoking will cause many diseases and make people have no energy so a person'd better not smoke. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, there will be less and less smokers. However, there are still some people who are addicted to smoking. They can't completely quit smoking. However, smoking will also affect health of the people close to the smoker. That's really terrible. One person's smoking will make the harm spreads and many people have to suffer innocently. As a result, smoking must be banned in public places like restaurants. Secondly, the gas spreading from the cigarette will surely make other people in the restaurant feel uncomfortable and they won't have a good appetite so the restaurants have to suffer from the smokers. Banning smoking in all the restaurants will not only enable people to lead a healthier life but also provide the restaurant a better chance to earn more profits. Thirdly, people who don't smoke have the right to have a good environment without other people's smoking in the restaurant. The smokers need to obey to the needs of the most people. In all, banning smoking in restaurants will bring benefits to everyone and this trend is absolutely irreversible.
