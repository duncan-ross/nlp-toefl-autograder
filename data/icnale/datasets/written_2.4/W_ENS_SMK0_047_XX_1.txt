20 years ago, smoking was cool and in style, but as time passes it becomes not as common as people come to understand the harmful effects and other issues. Nowadays, many people think it is much cooler to not smoke, as they will have a very difficult time to find a significant other if they are a smoker. If you are a non-smoker, you can date almost anybody you want to, but if you are a smoker, you can pretty much only date other smokers. This is because nobody likes the taste of an ashy mouth, and even just thinking about that gives me the shivers. Also, smoking is a rather expensive habit, and many smokers waste quite a lot of money on cigarettes or chew. I think the reason that people keep smoking is because of the nicotine, because it is a drug that gives them a high. The ironic thing is that you can achieve a similar high by doing healthy activities like working out which release good chemicals in your brain and body. Perhaps if the Japanese people knew about this they would have a much easier time finding a solution to the smoking problem in restaurants. Please tell them.
