Smoking is an unhealthful thing because it is not only harmful to the smoker's lung but also the other people around the smoker. Some research claim that second- smoke is also harmful to human beings. Most of all, smoke would induce the lung cancer and increase the possibility of the other cancer. Thus, I consider that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not everyone like smoking. And if we allow the smokers to smoke in the restaurant, the air would be awful and stingy. The smoke would cover the smell of the delicious food. Other people would not like the situation because the smoker influences their mood in the restaurant. By the way, it is not easy to divide smoking area and non- smoking area clearly. In my experience, I can even smell the smoke in the non-smoking area! Thus smoking should be banned at the restaurants. In conclusion, the smokers should respect the others and do not smoke in the public area. But maybe it's possible for the restaurants to make a small outside smoking area to the smokers. In that way, they could smoke and don't need to influence to other non-smokers.
