There is nothing worse than coming home after dining out and finding that your clothes smell like an old fireplace or a dirty ashtray, because they have absorbed cigarette fumes. I wouldn't mind so much if I was a smoker I guess, but I'm not and the stench irritates me to no end. Now I am not saying that all smokers are bad and that they shouldn't be allowed in all public places, but I do feel that the areas that are set aside, if any, for non-smoking and smoking in restaurants in Japan are totally inadequate. Of course I have health concerns as well, just like many others do when it comes to breathing in secondhand smoke, but the stench seems to irk me more. Perhaps it's because it is immediately noticeable whereas illnesses and death usually just creep up on you. I don't believe that there is any easy way around this as I feel that any exhaust fan remedies are far from being the ideal solution. In my mind, there is no point in dancing around it and it would appear that the only viable solution would be for Japan to put a ban in place or quite possibly have completely separate smoking and non-smoking restaurants although, I am not too sure how viable that would prove to be as a business proposition.
