Some days ago, I watched a video called Justice. This is a class held in Harvard university. The famous professor showed some data to his students. The cigarette factory make many profit by producing cigarettes and they pay large sums of tax to the country. I can't remember the number of the data exactly, but this profit is much bigger than the money spend in curing the illness that the cigarettes bring to us. So this draw forth the consideration of whether the government should forbid smoking when all of us know the bad effect of smoking. In one aspect, smoking enlarge the social wealth and give more people jobs. However in the other aspect, smoking results in cancel and other illness. So what should the government do and what should we do? my opinions are as follows. Firstly, I think we should completely banned smoking in all the restaurants step by step because it is impossible to carry out this big plan in a short time. With the develop of the technology, people have change their view on cigarette, and few and few people are smoking now, which suggest us that banned smoking completely is possible. Secondly, I think we should not allow cigarettes destroy out health even it have some many advantages to the country. There must exist some other things that can take place cigarettes. We can develop that factory. We hope that we could have a no-smoking world in the future.
