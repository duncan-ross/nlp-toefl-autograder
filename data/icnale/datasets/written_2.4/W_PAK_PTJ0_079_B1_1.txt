While high school and the years before were fairly smooth for many young teenagers, the college life can be quite the transition. Many college students attend private and public institutions and have to foot the bill. While financial aide and student loans help cover some of the costs, a vast majority of college students are taking on part-time jobs to help offset the costs of university life. With the cost of education on the rise, more students are feeling the need to try to achieve some sort of financial independence. Although a part-time job can be discouraging at times, the experience of work can more than make up for it. Every year the cost of education is on the rise. Unless the universities work to lower their tuition rates, students and their families are finding themselves in a bind. In most cases, financial aide and scholarships are offered on a need and/ or merit basis. Unfortunately, a vast majority of college students do not necessarily fall into those categories. Although the idea of acquiring a part-time job may be discouraging to some students, it does have its advantages. For many students, college is their first experience living away from home. In most cases, students have had the protective watch of their parents or have taken minor jobs at their parents' insistence. Once in college, the student is more independent. Allowed to fulfill almost every desire, the student must work to stay on track and be successful. For many students, this is the first taste of financial independence. Granted, some students receive a steady flow of money from their parents, a majority of the others have to budget their expenses and take on a part-time job to supplement their income. It is a fact of college life. For the most part, acquiring a job is not something most people look forward to. Unfortunately, it is a necessary fact for many college students. However, with independence come stipulations and responsibilities.
