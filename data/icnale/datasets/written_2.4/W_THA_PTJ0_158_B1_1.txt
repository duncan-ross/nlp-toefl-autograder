In college life that there are a lot of costs to pay which may be necessary and unnecessary, so the extra money is very important for those students who want to live on comfortably and Part-time is one of the things that many students can do for their money. In the college which you have to pay a lot of money such as for dorm, food, facility and etc., If your parent money is not enough then I strongly agree the part-time job. For me I want to have a part-time job to but when I ask my parent may I have a part-time job and they just want me to study only. The problems are time, when you have part-time job you must sure that you could manage the time and you can study with a little time for it. But for me part-time job is good Because It can help you to know the cost of money and help you can practice your skill like if you good at playing music so, you can play music in pub as a part-time job, if you good at English so you can be a translator. The conclusion for me is part-time job is good for the one who can manger their time and have free time and bad for one whom have no time and not have responsibility.
