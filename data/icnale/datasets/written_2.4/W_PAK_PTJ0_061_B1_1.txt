Part time job is the work done in extra time to earn some money. Part time jobs are good for college students as it help them to as it them to pay their fee and allow their parents to relax. If also given students confidence, make him self drive, it help him to know the world, its goodness and its badness, they also give him experience. Part time job makes a person or a student self service. Mostly people of Pakistan are very poor they cannot afford the fee of higher institutions so that their children can study i. e, take a example of G. I. K university Islamabad. It fee per smester is 1 lac and that of Nust, Fast, K. E, Lahore college, G. c etc has not less them 70, 000 Rs/-. So imagine if a child of a poor person study in these institutions what is their condition behind? How can they survive? What can they do? What can they spend on the study of other children? But imagning these we come to know that a student living in these adverse condition has no opportunity instead of part time jobs. Part time job has also some negative effect on the health of a student, on his study. It make him sick of every other thing. So, it is duty of a government to provide opportunity to these students. The help of government make these students free of tension and allow them to study hard with concentration.
