I agree with the statement above regarding the prohibition of smoking in public places like restaurants because it would be very annoying person who is around smoker are what hope do we already know and understand the dangers of what will be caused by smoking, although we do not smoke if you breathe in smoke from cigarettes we are indirectly become passive smokers and to be affected the same with active smokers so that that ban smoking in all public places is very good. From the research I did turned out to smoke a cigarette can spoil the taste of these foods, because before we eat food we can assess the taste of food with a delicious smell which increases appetite, can we imagine if that delicious smell is mixed with the smell of the other will cause people to be reluctant to eat at a place that made rules that prohibit visitors smoke inside the restaurant so indirectly the owner of the restaurant to give comfort to the visitors. But in reality are no longer effective way because a lot of visitors who still smoke inside the restaurant was probably due to the lack of socialization to the visitors about the ban, perhaps because it is now a lot of restaurants that create a special place for smokers to smoke more active in order not interfere with the visitor which is in the restaurant.
