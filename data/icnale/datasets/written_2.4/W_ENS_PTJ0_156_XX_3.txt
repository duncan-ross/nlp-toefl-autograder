I disagree. If it was so important then the students would do better by getting a full-time job and going to college part-time. When I paint, my focus is completely devoted to unraveling the picture that comes from with inside me. If my attention is not directed entirely at what I am doing the painting will be flawed. I believe that is the same with college studies too. When I was in college, I was completely zeroed in on completing my degree, nothing else. Because of this, I was able to do exceptionally well at everything that I did whereas, if I had to think about going to my job, then it would have been virtually impossible for me to put out my best effort. I think that it is OK if people have a part-time job because they need to, what I am saying is that I don't believe that it is important to have one just because they are at college. My parents would disagree with my point of view but that is OK and they are entitle to their opinion just as I am. I just believe that if students or anybody wants to do well in any activity, course or whatever, then they need to be there completely focused and in the moment.
