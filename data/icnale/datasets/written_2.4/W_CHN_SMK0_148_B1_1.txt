In our country, smoking was enjoyed only by man long time ago. As the status of woman now is promoted in present-day society, they can smoke like men and even regard smoking as the symbol of fashion. What's more, smoking is becoming popular among many young persons. At any places, the smoking persons can be seen any places. However, as to me, it's an ugly behavior especially in public places, such as restaurants. I advocate that smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking has a serious bad effect on our health. Cigarettes contain various poisonous elements which can be deadly in some degree. If somebody is addicted to it, his body will be exhausted gradually. In public, most of people want to live in harmonious environment and don't hope to be surrounded by smog which is spread by smokers. The smog can be breathed in by others who stay beside the smokers and have no habit to smoke. At this time, it does more harm than the smokers. Furthermore, many people will have a headache or have no appetite on food when smog fills the air at restaurants. When the rest of a cigarette is thrown down with going out, it may cause a fire. To create harmonious environment at restaurant, to appreciate the delicious food, to care about the health of your friends and families, please stop smoking.
