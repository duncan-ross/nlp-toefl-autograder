Smoking is very bad for one's wellbeing and health for the reason that it causes various types of cancer and it greatly harms vital organs in the human body. This type of vice is hazardous for it kills. It only not harms the smoker, but also the people surrounding him or her. Nowadays, many people smoke. Even at restaurants people smoke. In my opinion, when it comes to people smoking in cafés and bistros, and for the act of smoking to be banned in those places, smoking should be banned. Smoking must be banned in restaurants because even though restaurants are ventilated places, second-hand smoke is still a danger. Not only smoking causes bad breath, it gives off pollution to the environment and to the eating place. Imagine people smoking in five star restaurants. It is not only a smelly place, but it can be a place of death since the people inside are slowly killing one another through first –hand and second-hand smoke. Yes there are specific places in restaurants where you can puff cigars and smoke. But in my own perception regarding this matter, bistros, cafes and restaurants, would be a much safer place for children, teenagers, and adults, even senior citizens, if smoking will be banned in those places, smokers will be forced to not smoke and they will be more considerate to those who are not smoking. Moreover, smoking is not just a silent killer in the society, but a bad diversion to citizens. Many hazards and warnings were already given to the mass for a long time yet numerous people still dwell on smoking. In the end, I will still depend on the people if they will follow and ordinance or not.
