 Part time job is becoming more and more popular. Many college students take part time jobs to get money to pay for the university or get some work experience. I think, part job is necessary for university students. First, part time job, in my opinion, is not just a way for money, it is a way to get work experience and learn about the society. Today, employees want not just your high grades, but also your work experience. Suppose that there are two persons wanting a job, one has a two-year part time job experience and the other has never worked for others before, the employee is sure to hire the former. So, part time job will help you find a better full time job. Second, part time job is also a way to get money. In the past, it is our parents who pay for us, but now we have grown up. It is responsible for us to make money ourselves to help our parents. I think parents will be happy to see that we can make a live by ourselves. Third, taking a part time job can help us make some friends of all kinds. Today, friends can help you a lot. They can give you good advice or they can help you when you get trouble. Part time job will let you know a lot of workmates, and they maybe your friends. From all above, we can see that a part time job is really necessary for college students. Some of my classmates have already taken part time jobs. So, find a part time job for yourself, it will help you a lot!
