I really think that it should. I have been to a few restaurants in Japan and in one of them the smoking area was directly across from me with no glass, walls or any kind of partition and the smoke was thick and everywhere. People need to think of their health and their families' health more too. I don't think that the restaurant owners care because they will just think of where most of the money is coming from first. Not sure how the system works in Japan, but if I were the government, I would just issue a ban overnight because it's their job to protect the people. I know there are a lot of smokers in Japan and one of my smoking friends even joked to me that Japan was one of the cheapest places in the world to get cancer and become and alcoholic. I don't know that I would want to do that but I think that the government should go ahead and ban it. Everybody knows that smoking kills lots of people every year and I think that government do not need debates about that. They have all the proof that they need to go ahead and just do it without having to drag out some long legal process about it.
