I think that it is great for college students to have a part-time job, but for the sake of argument I will be taking the opposite side, that is, the side of things college student should not have a part-time job. When a college student has a part-time job, they basically have an excuse to not focus very hard on their schoolwork. It's basically like giving them a free pass to under achieve. College students in many ways already have an occupation and that occupation is to go to school. Furthermore, part-time work is very boring and not a lot of college students like to do boring things. We want to have fun and experience a lot of new things in college, but we have our whole lives to work but we don't have our whole lives to have fun. Also, it is very hard to find a part-time job that is flexible enough and allows studying so that students could use their time effectively even while working. The best work study positions are taken by the smartest kids and the employers to want to hire anyone who doesn't have a 4. 0 GPA. For these reasons, college student should focus on other things that part-time work while they are in college.
