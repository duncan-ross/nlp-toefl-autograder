I agree with the statement Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking near by your pizza or salad, all the delicious smell and such a fresh green leaf or tomato will be covered by smoke and taste will change. Since I am not smoker, I can say that it should be completely banned. It might be too strict rule for all the people and it is impossible to change all the restaurant and customer who visit the restaurant. But I think smoking is very unkind thing for non-smoking people. Even Some restaurant asks you for smoking table or non-smoking table, there is no wall between them so the smoke come into the non-smoking table too. It is unfair we both paying same amount for the meal and one is having good time and the other feels bad about smoke covered meal. All in all, we need totally separated from smoking place in restaurant. Some smoker says if you don't want to get smoke from smoker, you shouldn't be at the same place and come to there. But we all have right to say that wonderful meal always should be wonderful taste. What I am trying to say is smoker and non-smoker has different opinion for smoking, so we all need to think and care about ourselves each other.
