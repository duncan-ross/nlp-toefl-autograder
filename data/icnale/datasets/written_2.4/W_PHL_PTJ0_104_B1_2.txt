A job is what everyone needs right after attending college. Or mainly, job is needed in order to have money in order to live. However, are jobs created mainly just for the people outside the school? No, job is for everyone. Nowadays, even students have jobs. Those students work in order to have allowances or sometimes, in order for them to have money for their tuition fees. That is where part-time jobs come about. Having a part-time job may also imply that the student's family doesn't have the enough money to sustain all their needs. Hence, being involved in a part-time job is a great help to continue living the life a certain student wants. The previous statements state the positive side of having a part-time job. However, like other things in the world, having a part-time job also has a negative side. It is undeniable that when you have a job, you need to reserve a time for it. One may say that there is this so called shift in every job so there is little time needed to be off to school. However, it is also undeniable that no matter how little the time taken away from students for a job, it still affects their lifestyle. Take for example a student working on a fast food chain. She has to manage her time between her studies and her work. Because of her busy schedule, she might not be able to reserve a time for 'fun ', such as hanging out with friends and attending family events. Having a part-time job may be considered important especially when that job is related to the course a student is taking. Also, the money earned in a job is a great help to sustain living. However, if he or she was not able to manage his or her time wisely, the essence of having a part-time job is lost and will be insignificant.
