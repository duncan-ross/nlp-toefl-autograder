I do agree that working while studying of college students is important. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, I think working part time job gives students many lessons to learn about life. For example, they have learnt how to be patient to work and they learnt how to be responsible of duty of work and study, and they would learn how to manage themselves; it's sure that they might have a time table to manage themselves for work and study, and also they can learn how to live with different people and different ideas, so they can share their experiences with others. It's good a way to teach teenagers before they reach the working age. Next, I think working as a part time job of college students can make money, even if it's not much, but they can use the money for studying and whatever they want to buy. They don't need to ask from parents if they want to get something. It can reduce the burden of their parents. Then, they will know the value of money and know how to spend money in good ways carefully. However, working part time job is important for college students in many ways. They are to give the lessons for students to learn such as patient and responsible, and also they can help their parents reduce burden.
