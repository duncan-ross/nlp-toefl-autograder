I disagree with that statement. Of course I don't smoke because I am now still 19 and don't like smoking. I think recently, the number of the people smoking in a public place like load, station and so on. In a restaurant, there are often two rooms, smoking room and not smoking room. I really appreciate it and use not smoking room because I don't smoke. I think there are some troubles, but if smoking is banned more over, the people who smoke cannot go outside with smoking. But when I go to a restaurant with friends of mine who smoke, there occurs a trouble. I have to put up with smoking or they have to bear smoking. I think restraints should make a room where both of people who smoke and people not smoke can eat. For example, they make the machine which takes all smoke. It may cost a lot, but I hope it to be made. Also, the restaurant which all the rooms is for the people who smoke should be made because the room where people can smoke is restricted and the room where people can smoke without any hesitation is necessary. I understand that smoking is harmful, but people can choose whether to smoke or not smoke. As long as people can smoke, the room for smoking is necessary for smokers.
