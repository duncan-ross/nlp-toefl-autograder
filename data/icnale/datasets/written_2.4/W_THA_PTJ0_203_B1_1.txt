I'm strongly agree with the sentence is "It is important for college students to have a part-time job. " But a part-time job have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, people who study in university, they must to apply knowledge to use in their job in the future. They must to practice their knowledge and experiences many time. If a part-time job have relation with major that students learning, it so good. Because it can help many things for them such as experiences using knowledge working with other people students are development and etc. Students have a part-time job when they have a free times. They get money from a part-time job. They are learning about how to working. A part-time job make students are rule. But a part-time job have an effect to healthy. Students have little times for relax. Have a part-time job are advantages and disadvantages. They can apply knowledge with situation. They have experiences and they can learning many things form a part-time job. But it make bad healthy for students. And it may be have disadvantage to education too. However, it depend with my self, how can I develop with situation and working. They can have advantages more than disadvantages.
