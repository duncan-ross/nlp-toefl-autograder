Smoking is an activity that should be banned in all public areas, including restaurant. I need to say this statement because I have already felt a lot of negative effects when I was in the same place with people who smoking. In closed rooms, this problem will become even worse; the smoke from cigar will keep circulating in that room and inhaled by others. And if there is a food like in the restaurant, food will be contaminated by ashes and go into human body as well. For these problems, it obviously affects person's health. Smokes and ashes that enter human body will slowly damage respiratory and digestive systems. If this person is exposed to these smokes for a long period, eventually, he may get some kind of cancer. The other reasons why smoking need to banned is the inconvenience caused by this activity. Not all people like the smell of the cigarettes' smoke, even some people will cough heavily or get asthma when they inhaled too much smokes. In public areas, such as bus stop or toilet, we still can avoid these smokers by moving away from them. But in restaurant, we can't just leave our foods and go out from the restaurant. Tell the smokers to stop is also not easy to perform. So, the best way is from the officers in the restaurant to stick a non-smoking sticker at the front door.
