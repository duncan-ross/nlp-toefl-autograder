For me, I really hate the smell of cigarettes. And every time I see a man who smokes around me, I just want to run away and think all the problems about the health. Especially in restaurant, it should be a comfortable place and a clean space for those who come here to taste a delicious meal or have a talk. It's a relax not a bear. So everyone who wants to smoke please go outside or go to the place with a little people. I'm so pleased that the government in Taiwan had announced a new law that it's forbidden to smoke in public places even most of places in universities. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country had done in Taiwan-my country. By the way, how to promote the policy? One of them is using the power of the mass. The government emphasizes the damage of smoking by showing the pictures, the black liver for example. And also reveals the statics the amount of people who got cancer because of the effect of smoke. Another way is adding the tax on the buyers. Three of them are useful in Taiwan and actually prevent some people smoking and decrease the rate of smoking.
