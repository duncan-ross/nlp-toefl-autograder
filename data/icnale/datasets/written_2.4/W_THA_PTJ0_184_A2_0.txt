I think a part-time job are not important for students in Thailand. Because parents support them and what they need to do is only study the lessons. Some students have part-time job which I think it is great. I think If they do not have a part-time job or get something what they want easily. They do not know value of money and slavery of capitalism. Part time job will take their time on studying after school and at night. Some students will need to go back to home very late in the evening. They will have bad grades at the end of terms. Their fathers and mothers will sorry and be not happy at the same time. They will study hard in the next term to finish the university as fast as possible. However, part time job has a good side and a bad side. Students need to consider which one is really important and necessary. Asking yourselves, do I really need to do a part time job? Why? Try to list and find reasonable reason to support your ideas. You may waste or lose a good opportunity if you got wrong decisions. I don't mean that I don't support the part time job but for me it's just not important. So, I don't agree to have a part time job while studying if your family can support you.
