There are several way to destroy your health. People always do it even if they know how bad it is. For example drinking alcohol eating disorder going bed late and last but not least smoking. In Thailand, we can see people smoke in public place like on the bus, in the park, or even restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is not allowed in some restaurant. In some restaurant, they have the forbid tag of smoking on the door. Everyone know well about smelling the smoke. It is not destroy smoker but it also destroy the people who is sitting nearby. In Thailand, we should ban the people who smoke in public place by go way from them and leave them alone. This way will make them have no friend. The important problem of smoking in public place is smoking in the restaurant. In spite of having forbid tag in front of the restaurant they still do it. The restaurant owner should fine them or maybe the owner should charge two time of the price of food that they have ordered or service them unpressured. This is also the government responsibility too. They should have a very high measure to fine them or them manage with the people who do not know the social manner.
