It is important for college students to have a part-time job, but the main purpose of it is not earning more money. Many college students have part-time jobs because they want to get more money for entertainment or clothing; however, another benefit gained from part-time job is often ignored. Earning money is definitely a good reason for having a part-time job, but at the same time one acquires something more valuable. Since college is a place where one prepares for his/her future career, having a part-time job helps one to obtain different experiences and gets used to the working environment. For example, working as a restaurant clerk, one may learn how to interact with strangers and how to provide best service for customers; also, working as an assistant, one must pay great attention to all the details and SOP for meeting or presentation. Moreover, a part-time job should be regarded as a real job, which one must put patience, responsibility, and perseverance to; through part-time job, one learns how to take the responsibility to finish his/her work, getting along with colleagues and even boss. Hence, part-time job should not be considered as a tool of making money, but an opportunity for one to cultivate social and working experiences, which are necessary for college students.
