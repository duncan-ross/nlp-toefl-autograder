Smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, smoking is not good for smoker's health and people's health that be around them. Especially in the public place such as the restaurant where have a lot of people who want to eat a delicious food, they must get the toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride that cause cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. The smoke and smell from cigarette may interrupt people who are eating and make surrounding around the restaurant to be bad. Moreover, it is not good for children to see people smoking because it might lead them to believe there is nothing wrong with smoking. Now there are smoking sections and nonsmoking section in the restaurant, but there is nothing to physically keep the smoke in the smoking section and some restaurant ignore this separating section just like a lot of places forget to close the door between the sections. Smoking has an affect on personality, health of the smoker and including to people around the smoker. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned not only in all the restaurants but also all the public place.
