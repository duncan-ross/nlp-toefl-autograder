 I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Entering colleges means children's growing up. Students should try to learn as much as they can during days in colleges. Because this is the time you needn't worry about too much life problems and have many chances to obtain new things. Especially in China, students have little time to do things themselves before being a college student. College time is good time to become mature. We can feel much through earning money ourselves. On the other hand, we can collect much experience. All this is good for us. There is always a time when you have to make a living by yourselves. The more practice how, the easier the challenges that future has prepared for you will be. What's more, many people destroy their future for the lack of enough things to do. These people feel bored and don't know what to do after being set free suddenly. Then, they do some no-meanings to pull the time like playing computers day and night. They then form many bad habits. Finding work is good way to stop this from happening. So, college students of course should find part-time job.
