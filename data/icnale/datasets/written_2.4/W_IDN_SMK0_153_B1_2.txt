At present, the smoke is not unusual. In every country of cigarettes is a very good already at the meet. A variety of shapes, types, sizes, materials, prices, etc. In fact, cigarettes are very harmful to health, have been many studies that prove that the cigarettes are addictive substances that can cause cancer, heart disease, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, and adverse effects to give birth. Therefore, many restrictions on smoking, for example in restaurants, malls, hospitals, etc. I agree with the statement that smoking in public places such as restaurants are prohibited. Because the restaurant is a gathering place for all people from children to the elderly and even babies could also be there if there are families who brought her baby. It may not be a problem for the smoker but what about the people around him. People who are passive smokers certainly more dangerous. Therefore, if the restaurant wants to allow people to smoke in there, there should be a special place in its own right for the smokers. Probably still in a restaurant but there is a separate room as the room smoking. The government should resolute to give the sanction if that place collide, for example the restaurant will pay fines. Research also reveals the dangers of cigarette smoke on biological and chemical aspects of the human body. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned. Research says passive smokers is more harmful than active smokers. People would not feel comfortable if there is eating and near with smoker. And should be a cigarette factory too good to closed. People will get used to not smoking in public places and the longer it will reduce smoking.
