Some people maintain that smoking should be completely banned in the restraunt. I n their opinions, smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. Moreover, smoking is a waste of money. When one smokes a cigarette, he/she is actually burning money. Other people do not agree. They believe that smoking helps to sharpen one's mind and make them feel happy after a fine meal. Also the government gets a lot of money from cigarette taxes and also charge a lot for those who smoke in the restraunt. In my view, everyone has the right to choose his/her own way of life, but one does not have the right to impose his/her way of life on other people. So smoking in public places should be banned especially in the hotels and restraunt. If you wanna smoke in your own home, fine. If you live with someone who doesn't smoke you should have consideration for them though seeing as how second hand smoke is more dangerous than actually smoking. If someone decided to open up a place that was strictly no smoking - but said place had many other places around where you could smoke that were just like this place. Smokers are a minority and the way I see a lot of things go is that so long as they are not getting screwed, the ruling majority [in this case, non-smokers] are gonna screw you over. Now, smoking and non-smoking sections are good for a person like me - who doesn't have the greatest health - but what's the point of smoking while eating anyway?
