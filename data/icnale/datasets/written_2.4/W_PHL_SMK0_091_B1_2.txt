Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because we all know that smoking is dangerous to our health. All the advertisements always said that smoking destroys our health. But all the smokers don't pay attention to it but still, they used to smoke. For me, every smoker must think to other people who didn't smoke that they can affect others health even though they are not smoking, and they just called second hand smokers and to think that I 'm one of them, I think I will die in early years. When it comes to constructing a restaurant, when the owner or the manager makes project of his/her future restaurant, they should think not only about visitor's satisfactions from food or conditions and their relaxation and impression from his place. Because the most important thing is that they should take care of their health, they should not allow them to smoke in a hall, where there a lot of non-smokers. Nowadays, we can see that there are many restaurants that allow customers to smoke and hold a cup of drinking alcohol which for me is bad to the eyes of the young ones. I want to say that people should not be indifferent to each other. It is a real problem. Also smoking must be banned in not only restaurants and bars, taking everything into consideration I think that it should be banned in all public places such as streets, squares, and parks and so on. 248
