I agree with a it is important for college student to have a part job because I think spending free time to work a part time job is beneficial for me. I think we will get many things from doing a part time job. The first thing that we learn from it is money. Doing a part time job practice everyone to save money by themselves. It teachs every one to know money value and theach ours to know how to spend the money. Next I think doing apart time job make me know how to spend life in social because in real life we ought to relate with other people and it can't avoid because we can't live alone we have to talk with friends to go see a movie with a special one to dinner with family etc. If you spend your life alone you would be unhappy. The next we can learn from a part time job is communication skill because working in one day we ought to communicate with many people. It's practicing ours to communicate with people better. I think communication skill is necessary for everyone if we haven't a good communication skill it would be the obstruct for ours work. This is why a part time job important for college student.
