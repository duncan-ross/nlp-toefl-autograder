Whether is it important for college student to have a part-time job or not? This is a great problem. There doesn't exist a common answer. Firstly, we must have a clear understanding of University study, which includes theoretical study and practical experience of learning! Of course, we have a large number of chances to do the theoretical study. But the practical learning isn't the same enough. A part-time job is a kind of social practice that gets material and spiritual rewards by paying physical and intellectual labor to some specific organization or individual. So a part-time job occupying reasonable time benefit us. However, we must remember clearly all the time that the main purpose of our college life is studying which ought to take most of the time. So no matter how many you can get from your part-time job, keep yourself studying most of the time. Always remember that studying well is the largest expectation of our parents. As a matter of fact, we will have many chances to participate in social practice. In short, take a part-time job only when you can master all of your courses. For us college student's focus on learning is the most important.
