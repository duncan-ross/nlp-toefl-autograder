It is widely acknowledged that smoking does much harm for human's health and it should be completely banned at all especially at all the restaurants, which may not only benefit the person himself, but also do good for the people around. Like most of the other public places, restaurants are always crowded where different kinds of people stay together. They have meals, talk freely and at the same time have a lot of fun. However, it is often occurred that someone lit up a cigarette who may just be accustomed to this kind of relax but really bothers the others. People who don't smoking will feel very uncomfortable and unsatisfied, and people who smoke will tend to have a cigarette too which would make most of the other people around more unpleasant and not want to have meals any more. What's worse, those smokers obviously show bad manners, leave a bad impression and largely ruin their personal image. On the other hand, it is accepted that smoking does more harm to the people around than the very person who smokes. So the smoker really should be condemned as he sacrifices others' health for his own bad habits. OK, now imagine that you walk into a restaurant where there is so much smoke floating in the air that one can hardly breathe, would you want to sit down or even have a meal? Of course you won't. Therefore, for the sake of the fame of the restaurant and the health of all people, smoking should be completely banned. And as long as all of us put it into action, then the meals may taste more delicious.
