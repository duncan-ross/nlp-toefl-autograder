You can see the college students everywhere; most of them have a part-time job. The reason why the number of students who has part-time job is increasing is that having a part-time job has three benefits. First, about the money. As is known to us, a lot of college students are suffering from the money for study and living. Having part-time job is a good way to earn money. They can use their own ability but not ask parents for money all the time. They can make a living by themselves because this is the first step of being an adult. Second, about the experiences. Most of college students are not familiar with the society. If they have a part-time job, it will be a good chance for them to know more about the society. They can gain a lot of experiences during the job. Third, about the relationships. Students can only meet students or teachers at school. But when they have a part-time job, they can meet a large number of different kinds of people, such as businessman, officer and so on. They can teach you things that you cannot learn from school. You can set up your relationship with others. In summary, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
