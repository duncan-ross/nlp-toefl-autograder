Smoking in public areas is a huge debated issue in Singapore In my point of view, it is necessary to ban smoking in some areas, but concession should be allowed for some highlighted cases. Recently, the government has legislated against public smoking in certain areas to alleviate the inconveniences brought to passive smokers who are unwilling recipients of the tobacco. While non-smokers and environmentalists cheer to this law, some stakeholders in the society are dismayed by it. For example, business owners lament over the smoker-customers who are less willing to spend and dine at their establishments due to this restriction. To this end, we have to acknowledge that smoking is a social currency to some in the society, typically in bars and social hangouts characterized by business dealings and social exchanges. Offering a cigarette or a lighter to light up is known as a kind gesture to mark the start of a friendship or a reciprocal relationship. Social smoking is more tolerated than its pathological counterpart, and thus I would advocate for smoking to be allowed in certain areas. A complete ban on public smoking might have positive externalities on the public health and environment at large, but businesses and social dealings will have to be altered accordingly, to which, will lead to many dismal responses from the public.
