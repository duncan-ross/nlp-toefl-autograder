The cigarettes is not permitted to enter the restaurant, i agree with this opinion, because almost everyone know that cigarette smoking, is not good for our healthy. A restaurant is a public facility, where there are so many people who not at all of them are smoker. Many people go to the restaurant for their meals. Smoking is one of bad habit in our country, they called it as culture. After having lunch or dinner, they have to smoke one, two or more the cigarettes. In fact, they have to spend much money on cigarettes every day. We know there are so many effect if we are smokers, bad effect surely. First, the most effect is disturbing the breathing, disturbing the lung, and the most scream is cancer of lung, and so on. So this is one of reason, why the smoking is not allowed in restaurant. But i think, this is not only for restaurant as public facility, but also in other public places Some of the solutions is the owner of restaurant provide a special place for smoker, where at that place only for they who have a smoke. But at sometime, this rule is not followed by some people, they feel lazy to go to the box smoke. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoke and hard punishment for everyone who disobey the rule.
