I am a smoker, and although I agree that the restaurants thing is an issue, I don't think that banning smoking in restaurants will have the intended effect. If you ban smoking in restaurants, smokers will just find some other place to smoke, and it may be indoors. I think the real solution would be for smokers to become more considerate of others and learn how to smoke politely, as it were. It is possible to be a conscientious and polite smoker, and many people are very surprised when they find out that I smoke cigarettes because my clothes don't smell bad, my house is very clean and does not smell bad either, and I'd never smoke around people who are nonsmokers. If there were more people who are willing to be like this, smoking would not be a problem at all. Therefore, instead of banning restaurants from allowing smoking, why not raise awareness of the habits and actions that could be called polite smoking. Smokers have to deal with a lot of negative stigma already, whether they are good people or not, and I don't think it is fair to prosecute everyone based on the actions of a few.
