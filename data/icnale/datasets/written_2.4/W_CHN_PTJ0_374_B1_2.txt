 As is known to all, part time jobs never fail to appeal college students. A part time job can always teach something that you can not learn in class apart from giving you money. Time and intelligence can be fully used, ability and courage can be practiced, and you are bound to be fully rewarded. So as far as I'm concerned, it's important for us college students to have a part time job. For one thing, part time job offers you a golden opportunity to intercourse with a lot of people who you seldom have access to make friends with and who you can surely learn much from. This is very important for us, since we're highly likely to be locked in the ivory tower. It is often the case that we bury ourselves in books and tests and even isolate from the society. In addition, doing part time jobs, to some degree, makes students aware of something like duty and thrifty. I used to spend lavishly. But since I have done some part time job, I fully recognized that earning money is truly not an easy thing. Besides, students can gain a sense of achievement by earning money themselves which does good to their mental health. Last but not least, students can really learn a lot of skills and get self-improvements. To sum up, the advantages of doing part time jobs far overweigh the disadvantages. With a little bit of caution, you can acquire money, friendship, practice and fun in the same time. So why not?
