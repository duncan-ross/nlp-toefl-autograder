According to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, as of October 2009 71% of the U. S. population lives under a ban on smoking in "workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law, " though only 41. 2% live under bans in all workplaces and restaurants and bars. In many states have enacted smoking bans in all general workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants (though many of these exempt tobacconists, cigar bars, casinos, and/or private clubs). The remaining 11 states in the US have no statewide smoking ban at all, though many cities and/or counties in most of those states have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees (though Oklahoma prohibits local governments from passing smoking laws at all). So as the previous study, I want to see Thailand ban smoking in all public places (including bars and restaurants). Thai government should prohibits smoking in restaurants, and also extend to workplaces or any other businesses. We can control people to smoke as well as we can sell it. Smoking is not that bad because it can help someone to release their stressful (as they believe), and it helps the government to get some income for the country. So how can we deal with smokers, my summarization is about either banning them or put place for them.
