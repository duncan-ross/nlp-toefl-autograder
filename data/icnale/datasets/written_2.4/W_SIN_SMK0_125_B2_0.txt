I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As a non-smoker, the smell of cigarettes put me off and causes much discomfort. Second hand smoking, also known as passive smoking, is also known to cause lung cancer as well as many other health complications. Thus, I feel that the health of non-smokers should not be penalized by the act of inconsiderate smokers. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Furthermore, restaurants are a place for the enjoyment of fine food. The aroma of food should not be tainted by the smell of cigarettes. The smell of cigarettes are not appealing to everyone and hence, smoking in an enclosed place is an inconsiderate act, in my opinion. However, many restaurant owners may not be happy if smoking were to be banned because they may lose a considerable number of customers. These customers may be a group of people who either discuss business dealings or spend time with friends and family at the restaurant over food and smoke. If smoking were to be banned, some of these customers may not wish to carry on with these activities there anymore. They may head to other places where they can have a cigarette or two. Therefore, although smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in my opinion, I am aware that many smokers as well as restaurant owners may be concerned.
