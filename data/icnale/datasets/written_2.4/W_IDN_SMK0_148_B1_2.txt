I am not very agree with statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurant. There are some reason why people agree and disagree about this Reason why they agree, because we all know that cigarette contains many dangerous chemical like tar nicotine and many more. That is make smoking have very bad effect for our body. Reason two passive smoking, passive smoking means condition when we are indirectly smoking cause someone else smoking near us. Passive smoking have more risk to get cancer or eve death than active smoking. So many people agree that smoking was banned to all restaurant because many people became a passive smoking. Reason three makes some people lost their passion to eat. Because some people dislike smell from cigarette's smoke. Reason why they are not agree. Reason one cause there are so many smoker on this country. If we banned at all restaurant, that can cause restaurant lost many of their customer. Reason two, cigarette have a very high tax that means cigarette was a most valuable Indonesian devisa. And last reason that if we banned smoking that can makes many people very angry about this. So I think I am not very agree with this statement. I think we can makes other way that did not have a big risk at least do not have many pro con. There some way, like elite restaurant have a new kind of cigarette that was sheesa (I am not sure about this spell) sheesa can are not have bad effect to our body and do not have a bad effect for other people.
