Some people, especially smokers insist that smoking should be banned in all public places. Cigarettes give them inspirations and take them out of confusions. But, in my opinion, smoking should not be allowed in all public places. Here I'll give you some disadvantages of smoking. First of all, smoking is harm to people's health, not only to these smokers but also nonsmokers. There is a lot of data showing that many diseases are caused by smoking. Like, lung cancer, heart trouble, apoplexy, and so on. What's worse, the harm to the nonsmokers who breath in the smoke is much serious than smokers. Second, there are lots of fire accidents being caused by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the stumps away at will. It not only causes great loss, but also destroys the environment. Third, smoking in public places is not civil. It gives others an impression that these people who smoke in public places are selfish and immoral. Especially, what a bad impression it will leave to visitors from other cities or even other countries! In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all public places.
