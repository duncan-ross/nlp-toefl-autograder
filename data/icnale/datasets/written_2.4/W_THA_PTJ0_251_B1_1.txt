Nowadays, the commerce in many countries is bad that it can cause for many reasons such as politic, business, international contacts, education, occupations and so on. This affects college students directly and indirectly. After this situation occur in many country, the questions come that how the government or society plane to solve this problem, or whether or not the society has a good way out to help them that they are encountering it. In my opinion, I think that the college students should have a part-time job. when students are studying in college they must spend a lot of money. Sometimes their family can not support them enough money so, if they have a part-time job to work. It is a good way for them to help their family save money, too. Base on above issue, I strongly agree that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Otherwise, the college students will be able make moneys to support their study and sometimes their family. The part time job is a good teacher for them to learn about experience in working and adapt themselves in other people. Also, they will know new friends and can share their opinion, too.
