Smoking has been found to greatly increase the chance of getting lung cancer and various other dangerous diseases. But this is the smokers' problems themselves. Second-hand smoke, on the other hand, can be dangerous to other people around them. Second-hand smoke is often more dangerous than smoking itself, and it can harm other innocent people. There are countless articles on the dangers of second-hand smoke, where innocent people around the smoker like their significant others or child often become sick when around the smoker for long periods of time. The smoke emitted is also extremely bad smelling, and if smoking in restaurants are not banned, it may decrease the enjoyment of other customers with their experience in the restaurant. However, I recognize some people need to smoke, either as a tool to relax, or they are just so addicted to the disgusting nicotine in the cigarettes that they cannot stop. Thus, instead of completely banning smoking in restaurants, there should be specified non-smoking and smoking areas in the restaurant itself. This should be in an extremely secluded area where smoking will not impede on the enjoyment of other non-smoking restaurant goers. All in all, restaurants should not completely ban smoking, but have areas for both smokers and non smokers.
