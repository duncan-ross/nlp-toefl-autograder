Preparing for the future is a vital OPTION for college students; therefore, there is a freedom of choice. This world consists of different opportunities and experiences that could make or break a person. And in the working industry there are numerous ways that a person could make it to the top or not. College, on the other hand, is the preparation stage wherein it helps you land in a good job. So why hesitate in getting a part-time job if college in itself prepares you for the outside world? Yes, it is a good option that some have a part-time job in order to be prepared —but it just does not always have the same results. It really relies on the person's capability, personality, character and focus. If you're the type of person who takes time and needs more focus as compared, then getting a part-time job may not be the best option; and it just might tire you while balancing your studies. But if you truly have the backbone and skill in action, and you really know that it will benefit you and others, then take the experience and make it worthwhile—after all, it is a part-time job.
