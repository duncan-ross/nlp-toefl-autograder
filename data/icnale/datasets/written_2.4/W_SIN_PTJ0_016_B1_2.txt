Part-time work is undertaken by a wide variety of people. Students during holidays frequently do part-time work to get extra pocket money. Many are motivated to purchase something for themselves like a new game or gadget while others do so because their parents do not give them pocket money during the holidays. Adults or students who are studying full or part time may also work part-time to get enough money to pay the tuition fees or other living expenses. There are also adults, the elderly especially, who work part-time to pass the time. A full time job requires too much commitment for these folks so a part-time job is ideal. These individuals are not very motivated by the money earned as most would have enough savings. Part-time work may also be applicable to graduates who are unable to find a desired full-time work because of a bad job market. During bad times, there would be graduates from polytechnics or universities who are qualified for and desire a full-time job but are unable to find one. Part-time work would be a good option for them as firstly it would help to pay the bills. Moreover, it would make his or her CV look better compared to it having a long period of time where the individual is unemployed.
