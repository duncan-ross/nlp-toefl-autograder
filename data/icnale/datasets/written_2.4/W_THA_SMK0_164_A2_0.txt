I think that smoking is hazardous to the health of people who smoke and those around because smoking contains a lot of toxic to the cancer cause. In restaurants that people regarded as a public service generally used to relax and eat food that we want the taste of good food and good atmosphere. I was the one who hate the tobacco and all about smoking. When I saw anyone who is going to smoking, I will go outside that place or go out. I think they should go smoke in the smoke that the restaurant provided or should not smoke because it is not time to smoke when you go to the restaurant. They should think it is time for eating, they should have fun for eating and enjoy the taste. Why they have to smoke in the restaurants, that doesn't make any sense for me at all. To smoke outside will not disturb the people around you so it might be good for other people. They should honor and respect the privacy of others. I agree with them so that prohibited smoking at restaurant because at least we can place free from tobacco smoke causes cancer and the environment around us is not good to have delicious food. Free from toxic environments.
