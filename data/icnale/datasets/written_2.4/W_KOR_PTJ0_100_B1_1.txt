I have several part-time jobs during college. I worked pubs, pizza hut, and restaurant. I was at a restaurant serving guests and guidance. I made pizza and spaghetti. At Pizza Hut and I was cleaning the kitchen. While I work in a variety of pubs and ate the world beer there was a great experience while working part-time was a new experience. Meet new people a good friend, brother, sisters were dating. And the best part about is the money that occurs. I like bananas, apples, strawberries, pineapple, oranges, and tomatoes. By the way I like it a lot and ate the food in the shop. Even though there were bad times when a part-time job. When there were a lot of guests i was really tired. 23 years old last time i experience a part-time job experience. Part-time job in itself is assumed to be a good experience. If you work part-time you will learn to be patient. And to will earn any money. With that money, parents, brother, sister, brother, friend, teacher is received gift you could always give a gift. And that money is just use for you. When college part-time job as a good experience, I think.
