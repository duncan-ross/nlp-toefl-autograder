There are many part time jobs. Every student has worked a part time job at least once for making their pocket money or any reasons. These days it is very difficult to get a job more and more in our current society. I think the part time job is helpful to us and our future. Because we can save money by making money for ourselves. My parents said people can know the value of money when they make money for themselves. In my case, I understand my parents' saying although I have not worked many part time jobs until now. For our future, we can have a social experience in advance before we get a full-time job. We meet many people through the part time job so, we can find our aptitude. We can know ourselves better and decide our future job. Therefore, the part time job can be a first-step for starting our real goal and we can experience many things that are bad or good in a part of our life. The more we work a part time job, the more we get many experiences and make much money. The part time job has a variety of merits.
