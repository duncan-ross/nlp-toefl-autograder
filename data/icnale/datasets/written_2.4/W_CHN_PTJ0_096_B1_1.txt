When I was young, I was told by my teacher that for a student, it's more important to learn study-ability than learning knowledge. However, my teacher never pointed out the way of learning study-ability, he only teach us how to win the knowledge competition as other teachers, even he knew the importance of the study-ability. I think Chinese students were just like eggs lived in a tremendous protection system before they stepped into university. College students were better, they were more independent, analytical and original, but still were newborn chicken with a piece eggshell. This was a result of many factors, but that's not my focal point, I wanted to focus on how to help college students get rid of the last eggshell. Actually, the answer always was not unique, hundreds people had thousands ways to make them more mature. For most college students, having a part time job was a wise and effective way to get rid of the last eggshell, to make up the defect of growing up by the over protection system. Having a part time job gave you incentive of working hard because you earned from it ; Having a part time job enriched your college life ; Having a part time job made you more sociable and learned more life experience from it...... Actually I can list a lot of benefits of having a part time job for a college student. But we should notice clearly that the central theme was not how much money you earned, how many friends you made, was the ability you learned from the part-time job, was the ability of studying, was the ability of independence, that's the most important!
