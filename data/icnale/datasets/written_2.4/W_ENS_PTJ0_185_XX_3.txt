Yes, I do think that it is a good idea for students to get jobs. Apart from teaching them some basic work skills and practices it also gives them that much needed experience which employers like to see. I think that if they have had everything paid for all their lives, than this is a chance to learn that not everything is free and they have to learn to be responsible and not wait around for charity, gifts or their parents to hand hold them through college. Other students simply need to get a job because without one, they won't get through college which is perfectly understandable. I still think that getting a part-time job is good for all students because it is a brief introduction of what full-time work requires and it also may inspire them to strive for a better position if they are not happy with the part-time jobs that they took while attending college. For example, if one student worked as dishwasher and found the work to be distasteful, this may inspire that student to do better or aim higher in their career goals so that they never have to take that kind of job again in the future.
