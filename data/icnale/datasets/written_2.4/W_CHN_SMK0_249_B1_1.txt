 There are amounts of people who smoke all over the world. So there is a discussion whether people can smoke at restaurants or not. I think it should be banned. Firstly, given the health of smokers, it should be banned not only in restaurant but every place. In my opinion, it is cigarette that shouldn't exist at all. Secondly, we should think of this problem from customers who don't smoke. It is common sense that smoking hurt others more seriously than smokers themselves. Restaurant is a public place where customers have equal right to enjoy themselves. However, own to those smokers, most customers' health is threatened. Do you think that is equal? Besides, the smoke from the cigarette is always held up at restaurant because of the small space and the still air, which is smoky. Usually people feel uncomfortable even cough. Certainly, they won't have their meal leisurely and happily. There is no doubt it is unfair for those people. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I am in favor that there is sign which says NO SMOKING at all restaurants and everyone keeps to the rule consciously. Let's make efforts together to build comfortable environment for others and ourselves.
