Nowadays, more and more students tend to look for a part time job to do. Those students do most are teachers, workers, waiters and etc. These jobs always cost little time but count a lot. But for what is there such a tendency for university students to do it? As far as I am concerned, some students are not so rich so they want to earn some money to ease family's burden, some students may be eager to living on their own so that they can experience what the life is and imagine what it will be, the rest must want to earn more skills and gain more experience to win the competition in the future. As the economic crisis affects more and more countries, finding a good job become more and more difficult. So it is vital to make ourselves more and more skillful, part time job is a great choice. I cannot agree more. As for me,. I want to find a part time job this summer vocation. I want to understand the society better and find what parents have had when bringing me up. Also, I can earn money to buy something for them. for their birthday.
