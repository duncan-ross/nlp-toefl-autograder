It was important for me because it allowed me to take time off and travel to Japan. I know that some of my friends work because they wanted the money for student fees and books etc. At first, I had the same plan as they did but as time went on I found that I was losing interest in studying and always tired. So instead of just working to study, I decided to save some of the money for travel, take a short break and then return to my studies feeling refreshed and like I had done something for myself. I know that studying is worthwhile and I will finish my degree but I have also been studying for most of my life and felt like I needed a break. It has been great so far and I don't regret my decision one bit. My old man (father) wasn't too impressed with the idea though and tried to talk me out of it with these long boring lectures. Finally, I just decided to go ahead and do it and I am glad I did. So, I think that it is important for college students to work part-time because it gives them the freedom to either do as I did or just the cash to relax a bit more in style after so many years of study, study, study.
