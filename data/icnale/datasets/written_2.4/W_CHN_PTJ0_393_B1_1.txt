In terms of college students doing a part time job, some people hold the opinion that it is fairly beneficial. While others take the view that it is just a waste of time, because it is a distraction from college study. When it comes to me, I think that it is more a good thing than a bad thing. Here I list several advantages of college students doing a part time job: 1. We can undoubtedly improve our ability to get along with different people such as nosy consumers and strict managers, which contributes to our future working life. 2. We are bound to learn some useful skills from practice to a certain degree. Moreover, the experience of doing a part time job may help you to find a job after your graduation. 3. The incomes can be used freely. We needn't told our parents what we have bought because the money is our own reward. It really gives us a sense of being independent. In short, though doing a part time job may interfere with college students' study slightly, the advantages it brings to us is far more than the disadvantages. So, it is high time that we college students took a part time job, if only we have the chance.
