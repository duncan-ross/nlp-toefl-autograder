As we know, there are a large number of people addicted in cigarette all around the world. And the most serious problem is that people start smoking at a younger age than before. Therefore, it is strongly demanded that smoking should be banned in public especially at the restaurants. Image a restaurant full of unpleasant smoke and someone in the restaurant is smoking, giving out a smell others may don't like, do you think it's a good place to enjoy your meal? What's more, too much smoke may make people near the smoker cough sometimes, which will definitely influence his or her eating. In my view, smoking at a restaurant is not only impolite but also harmful to other customer. So, it must be completely banned. Furthermore, when a child has lunch at the same restaurant, he or she may be easily influenced by adults sitting nearby. That is to say, children are too young to distinguish a bad behavior with a good one. And innocent children may imitate the adults and try smoking at a very young age, which is extremely bad for their health. Therefore, smoking at the restaurant do harm to children as well, as a consequence of which, most parents will appreciate it if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurant. All in all, since smoking does no good to adults as well as children, I firmly insist that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants!
