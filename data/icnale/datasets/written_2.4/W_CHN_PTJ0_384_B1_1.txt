Nowadays more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. It's quite common to see students rushing from school to workplace. On this phenomenon, different people have different views. For my part, I think it's important for college students to do so. In fact, some people may think that it's a waste of time for college students to take part-time jobs because they can't get much money and it will be better for students to spend the time on study. However, I don't agree with it. In my opinion, although the most important thing for us is to study hard and get high marks in the final examination, part-time jobs do more good than harm to college students. As we all know, college is not only a place to read books and do homework; it provides us with all kinds of opportunities to improve ourselves. And taking a part-time job is one of the good ways to broaden our social experience. We can better understand what we have learnt in books and we can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which is very good for our job-hunting in the future. Furthermore, we meet all kinds of people when we take part-time jobs so we have to learn how to deal with them. That is, we can learn how to get along well with others and it's useful for us to enter the society. In a word, the advantages of taking a part-time job overweigh its disadvantage. It's important for us to have such an experience during college life and we will find it is really of help.
