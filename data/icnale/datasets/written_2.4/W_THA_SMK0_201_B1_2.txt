If I'm talking about smoking, I would have to say it isn't good thing to do. But today have many people do it, and do it in public. Badly, they are smoking in restaurants, where people eat foods, it doesn't good to do that I think. In Thailand we have a few people, who smoking in the restaurants, but in the entire public place we have more. I think smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants, and the entire public place, doesn't only the restaurants. And when smoking was banned by government or a lot of people, smokers will decrease. But we will have place for smokers to smoking, I think a small area or small room. It can't be like this because today we have a lot of people, who like to smoke, and some people love its. First I think we should completely banned smoking at the restaurant because smoking destroys emotional to eat, bad smell when eating it make me don't want to eat anything else. And there is a good first step to ban smoking at the entire public place. If smokers are conscious, we don't need to ban smoking in some place, just think should smoke in this place or not, just care people around you, just smoke in right place and just think of you family. Smoking isn't good with your life.
