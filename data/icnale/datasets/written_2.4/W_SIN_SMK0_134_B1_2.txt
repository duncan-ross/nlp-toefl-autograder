As a non-smoker, I would definitely like to have a blanket smoking ban on all restaurants in the country, and if possible, to even criminalize smoking and make it illegal everywhere in Singapore. But I do recognize that the choices of others' should be respected even though I may not agree with them and even if the scientific evidence strongly suggest that smoking is bad for health. To be fair to the smokers, they do pay a hefty tobacco tax in Singapore and this tax revenue has been used to fund the various social welfare programs. Though I respect the individual's right to smoke, actions have to be taken by the government when the actions of this group of people produce a negative externality to non-smokers. We have heard of the dangers of inhaling second-hand smoke and in this regard, smokers' rights must be balanced with responsibilities. Smokers can continue on smoking as long as non-smokers do not have to be forced to inhale their second-hand smoke. Therefore, all measures should be taken to ensure that non-smokers have access to smoke-free zones in restaurants. This however does not mean that smoking need to be banned at all restaurants. It just means taking sufficient safeguards to segregate restaurants into smoking and smoke-free zones, and making sure that the smoke does not diffuse into the smoke-free zone. Another possibility would be to have speciality restaurants which cater only to smokers where they can smoke all they want (and inhale the second-hand smoke of others) while enjoying their meal.
