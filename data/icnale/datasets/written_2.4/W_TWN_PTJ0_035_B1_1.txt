About college students to have a part-time job. I think that there is no absolute answer. Attitude is that we have to give attention to one thing. From working to upgrade our abilities, to expand our horizons and develop their own patient. From this, the part-time is not a bad thing, we can even change our values, get self-confidence, and relative reward obtained. When we work hard to get paid, the experience that is hard-earned money, and will therefore develop the habit of thrift. On the contrary, because of the expense of students working part, this is not right. It is undeniable that the risk of part-time too many hidden. For example, employees do not have insurance, out of the accident are not guaranteed. Second, the wage trap and more inexperienced people are easily deceived. Third, part-time contract, breach of contract payment is high, people can not leave. In short, part-time are both positive and negative. All in all, workers must tell our parents or friends to go with experience. Safety first, self-protection and self-judgment of good and bad things to ensure their own safety. Finally, I think if we take into account their own studies estimate would be good to play.
