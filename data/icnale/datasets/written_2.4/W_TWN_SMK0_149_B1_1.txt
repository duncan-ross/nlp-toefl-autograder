Smoking or not smoking in the restaurant? I agree the restaurant should forbid smoking. Why? Smoking not only damages you but harm any people and earth. No one willing inhales the secondhand smoke, I really hate the cigarette. I think everyone either. For example, when you eating at the restaurant, if a smoker smoking next your sit, can you tolerate there very nauseating gas? You eat not only food and you inhale the secondhand smoke, that may you feel like vomiting. Second, smoking is not a good habit, according the report; smoker will damage your body, like lung, tooth etc..., and the other terrible threat, according the research, the secondhand smoke is harmful than first smoke, so, please respect them who are not smoke. Finally, do you think smoking in restaurant are all disadvantages? I think the answer is yes, smoking just damage your body. Now, the government establishes the law to forbid smoking in public place, if you smoke, you will be fined, and please doesn't smoke in the restaurant, if you want to be fined, don't follow money very much obliged. Smoke just has disadvantages not any advantages and smoke not only damage you but harms any people and earth.
