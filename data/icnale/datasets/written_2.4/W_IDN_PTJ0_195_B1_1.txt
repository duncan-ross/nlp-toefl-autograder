I do agree to some extent if college students to have a part time job. I believe they may work part time if only they remember the following : First, if they can arrange the time between study and work. I see my own friends that almost all of them cannot arrange the time, so many tasks of the campus that are not resolved. Because, they spend more time to part their job and they often do not do school assignment. Second, they do not forget their obligations. Obligation at home and at campus. I see some of my friends who have a part time job is not present at campus, because their prefer their work. Because, their work cannot delayed and they think they get paid for the work. They know that they will not get paid if they do not do the job. Third, their part job do not bother their learning. Some of my friends who have a part time job complain that they feel tired and eventually they do not go to college or doing their tasks. Fourth, if they have a part time job that can develop their skills in particular related to the program that they took in college. They will more skill and a lot of experience. Some friends work but not related to their study. They only want the money.
