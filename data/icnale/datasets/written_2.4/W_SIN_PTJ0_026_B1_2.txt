I believe that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, emphasizing on the importance for college students to have a part-time job will only add an extra burden on the students' shoulders. When it is said having a part-time job is important, due to the competitiveness of Singaporean students to be the best, it would seem critical for them to obtain a part-time job. However, the average Singaporean college student is barely coping with the workload that college gives them. Thereby, giving the students one more burden to carry and cope with. Also, this will detract the government's aim to improve the work-life balance of Singaporeans. Thus, instead of having quality family bonding during their free time, they will be spending their time doing their part-time job. This may put a strain on their family relations, creating unhappiness in their household. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part time job due to the repercussions the society will have. Lastly, though having a part-time job will enhance the college student's resume and will develop their character and maturity, the main job of the college student is to study. With the cost of college education high, their education should be their priority over a part-time job. If the individual is able to do well academically, then he may choose to enrich their resume and college experience with a part-time job. This will beef up their employer prospects in the future. However, not having a part-time job in college will not hinder him from getting a job in the future. With a good attitude and the capability to learn and be taught, he can easily find a job in the future. Therefore, it's not important to have a part-time job in college.
