Students are the most important part of society. The form of future of country. If threr are talented eligble they can take the country to the glory of highet. But for this purpose education is necessary. Success demands full time education. But in our world some people, inspite of determination cannot give full time to education. Especially college students are doing. they do part time jobs. Some do just to spent time but some have financial problems. Their parents are poor. They cannot afford the books and their education demand so much money they cannot give. The parents due to their financial problems cannot give education to their children. Thus some students which want to get education fulfill their needs by doing part time jobs. In some cases, part timr jobs are necessary but in some cases they are not. The college student who do part time jobs have very bad effect on their education. They become double minded and cannot give maximum time to education. Their health also goes down. They become weak. They cannot manage both education and jobs to fulfill their needs. Government should try to take steps to give free education to such needy students so that they do not part time job to fulfill their needs.
