In my opinion, I agree that 'part-time job is an important for college students'. Because it has advantages for college students but there are also disadvantages. The advantages of part-time jobs are First, it is a good experience for teaching students to manage time between working and learning. This one makes them have more responsibility in their duties and grow up too. Second, college students have chance to find money (salary). So it helps them to realize how value of money is because they always get money from parents actually. If they need money, they just ask parents, they will get money to buy the stuffs they want suddenly. This behavior spoils them! On the other hands, if they do part-time jobs, they will know how hard to find money. Then this way helps them to save money and spend money in useful ways. Third, they get many friends and more society. This one helps them to know how to adjust themselves for being in society. All these advantages I said above are the suitable reasons to do part-time job if students can manage everything clearly. But there are some disadvantages if they can't manage time well, their learning will be worse. In university life, there are many activities and they should do them; just they do activities, their studying may be getting worse. Moreover they do 2 things together, activities and part-time job; they are tired and have no time to revise textbooks. Then it will damage your learning and grade! Furthermore, students still have no time to rest and that's so bad for their health. I'm the one who want to do part-time job so I agree college students to do it. But before they do, they should manage themselves well.
