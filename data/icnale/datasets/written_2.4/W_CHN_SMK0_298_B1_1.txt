 As is we all known, smoking does harm to our health. It is so normal to see a man or a woman smoking in public place. I don't know why so many people like to smoke everyday. Even though they clearly know that's a bad habit. They are seriously addicted to it as if they would die without it. Another word we know is smoking is to slowly kill oneself. Why don't we stop the step to the gap of death? But the worst is someone harm themselves' health but also others' when they smoke at some public place, such as the hospital, the airport, the train station and so on. Though there is no one state it is not allowed to smoke at these place, but we should take others' feel into considerate. When you are smoking, do you see the sick babies in the breast of their mums, if you notice people who need fresh air to keep minds functioning well? So next time when we want to light a piece of smoke in our hand up, we had better have a think will I influent others? Can I take the one in my pack and care about myself health? If we do so, I believe the number of people who like smoking in public places will become smaller and smaller.
