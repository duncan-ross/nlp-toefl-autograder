Some people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with it. There are some reasons to support my idea. In Chinese traditional custom, many people getting together are a pleasure, especially in a restaurant. However, the reality is that many people smoke in restaurants. Then people feel uncomfortable because others smoke in the restaurants. In my opinion, as a public place, restaurants are opening for every customer who wants to spend money on meal. So if one is smoking in a restaurant may annoy others, it is not a good idea for the boss to allow this action's existing. On other hand, many people who hate smoking may feel sick when they smell smoke so that they cannot enjoy their meal. For a long time, there will be no customers' presenting in the restaurant. That will be a big loss for the restaurant. If it becomes more serious, some customers may get disease even by having second-hand smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in a restaurant, as far as I am concerned, is not a polite behavior. So smoking in public should be banned and smoking in restaurants should be banned too.
