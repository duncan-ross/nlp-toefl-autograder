In my opinion, cigarette smoking should be banned not only in restaurants or in commercial establishments, but in the whole of the country. Smoking brings many complications not only to the health of smokers, but also to the environment and the health of non-smokers. Cigarette smoking's bad effects to the body include addiction, bad breath, and being the main source of lung cancer. Cigarette smoking also pollutes the air with carbon monoxide, which destroys our atmosphere. Another thing is even if you don't smoke, just inhaling side stream smoke or smoke exhaled by smokers, makes you a candidate for lung cancer or other lifestyle diseases brought about by chain smoking. In fact, many doctors I have heard from said that its effects are worse than inhaling smoking from a cigarette butt. For me, cigarette smoking should be condemned in the society for I believe it makes people waste away their life. It is of no advantage to people and it only cuts their lifespan, thereby, lessening the time they could have spent happily with their families. Our environment is also very affected to the point that our ecology suffers irreversible damage. Even though it has been long a part of our lives, I don't think it is ever too late to quit it.
