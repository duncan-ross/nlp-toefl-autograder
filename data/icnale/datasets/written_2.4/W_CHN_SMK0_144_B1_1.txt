I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking is not good for our health. Nowadays, a lot of people pass away because of smoking. When someone smokes, the fog will be in the air, so it makes the air not fresh. Unfortunately, if somebody breaths the fog, the poisonous physic will do harm to one's health and it is for you and for other people. When you smoke in a restaurant, you may feel it is a normal thing to yourself but it may be not a pleasure thing to other people in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant will break the harmonious circumstance and influence the feeling of people who are having their food. I think it is not a great thing to break one's good mood when you know your behavior will have this effect. I know it may be difficult for people to stop smoking in the restaurants but this policy is necessary. Although the origin is hard, I think if you persist, it will have a surprising success. Smoking completely bans at all the restaurants in the country that can make a good model to other political measures. Banning smoking may have a good effect on decreasing population who are smoking now and will be addicted to smoking. I think it is a good policy.
