Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I think my answer is YES. You can learn more and more experiments and earn money by yourself, if you have a part-time job in your free time. My high schoolmate has working since she was 16. After she started in her work, she became independent and responsible person. Now, she is a college student, she pays her tuition, she can buy anything that she likes, she got great grade, and her parents don't worry about her. In my case, I had a part-time job in last summer vacation. Though it was only two months, I still learned a lot of things. I really felt happy and proud, when I got my first income. It is good to do something by myself. I want to have a part-time job when I become to sophomore. I think that it is helpful to have a part-time job after school. It not only you can earn money, but helps you to know the society earlier. You can learn things earlier than the other that don't have part-time job. It is important for college students to have a part-time job, and that would be a wonderful experiment in your college life.
