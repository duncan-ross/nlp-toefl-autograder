Is a part time job important for college student? I think it is important for college student to get a part time job. When we come out to the world, there are a lot of things we couldn't experience before. Part time job can give us the opportunity to do new things. Of coursely it is important to study his or her major subjects because it is directly linked to their future job. But usually the thing we can learn in school is restricted to the only knowledge. Sometimes, by working in part time, we can newly interested in some things; teaching students, making coffee, and serving or checking in restaurant. I think all these experiences are linked to someone's future life and it will help them someday. Also, part time job enhances responsibility. Society is different from school life because the work is linked to money and relationship between people. We can learn the importance of promise between people and the way to keep good relationship with others. In these kinds of view, I think part time job is helpful for college students.
