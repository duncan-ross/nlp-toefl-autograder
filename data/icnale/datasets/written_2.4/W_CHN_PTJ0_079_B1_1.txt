Most people believe that it is the performance of those college students which is more vital than any other aspects. However, this opinion is now being questioned by more and more enterprises and experts, who complain that the graduates can barely do anything when they start to work. Those skeptics pay more and more attention on considering working experience of their interviewees. I agree to those skeptics' opinion that it's quite necessary for college students to have a part-time job. As it is known to all, college in China has offer students a circumstance with rather strict rules and schedule. That means, we will get more part-time and most of us will spent part time on playing, as a consequence, we will learn less and less, even not enough to feed ourselves after graduation. In addition, especially for those who want to have further study, those best commercial colleges in the world treasure working experience most. It is quite hard to get their offers, even ads, without enough working experience. For us, college students, who can hardly get regular jobs, part-time jobs become our best choice for that taking part-time jobs can we gain both working experiences and allowance. While the disadvantages can certainly not be ignored, taking a part-time job sometimes would occupy our classes and rest time. It will inevitably influence our performance. But compared to the benefits it brings, these disadvantages can be ignored. And we also can fix it by self-study and making a reasonable schedule. It would seem self-evident that it is becoming more and more important for college students to take a part-time job. Taking a part-time job graduates can not only easily integrate into our society but also more competitive to beat others to get offers to further study.
