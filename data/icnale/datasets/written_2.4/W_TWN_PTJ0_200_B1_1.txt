About college students to have a part-time job. I think that there is no absolute answer. I agree with the students working but would like to know how to protect themselves. Advantages and disadvantages of working with college students. If you can earn money, you can buy things you need, pay your bills, have a place to live, and basically do things you want to do. On the contrary, because of the expense of students working part, this is not right. It is undeniable that the risk of part-time too many hidden. For example, employees do not have insurance, out of the accident are not guaranteed. Second, the wage trap and more inexperienced people are easily deceived. The most important hope that students have their own wage-judgment. Finally, I agree with the reasons students are working. They are being responsible and making sure that you can take care of yourself and they are creating a solid foundation that you can build on to have a successful future, too. All in all, workers must tell our parents or friends to go with experience. Safety first, self-protection and self-judgment of good and bad things to ensure their own safety. This is a very good report statistical information on the report should be our reference.
