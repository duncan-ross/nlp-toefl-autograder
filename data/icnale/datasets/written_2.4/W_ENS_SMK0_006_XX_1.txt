Smoking should absolutely be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have never been to Japan, but I would definitely like to travel there one day, and nothing ruins the experience of a good meal with your friends or family at a restaurant like the smell of cigarette smoke. One of my girlfriends who studied abroad in Japan even went so far as to say that the fact that smoking was so prevalent and accepted in the Japanese culture was one of the worst parts of her time there. I am honestly somewhat surprised that smoking has not already been banned in public places given the enormous amount of research which has conclusively proven that smoking is singularly bad for your health. I just can't understand why people smoke in the first place because all it does is make you smell bad and greatly increase your risks of cancer. But I think that many kids start smoking in high school to be cool or to fit in with their friends and simply cannot stop even if they want to. Smoking is a highly addictive habit, and perhaps if the restaurants ban it, the overall health of the country will improve.
