There is no need for college students to have part time jobs because it would more often than not be a distraction from their studies. Furthermore, there is no need for students to stress themselves over part time jobs unless they have monetary issues, or unless they are working during their holidays. Even if they do have monetary issues, most schools should have aid for students to relief them of certain school fees and waiver costs of required items to ease the toll on parents. However, if it is the case that the student really has to work for his/her pocket money or to help with household expenditures, would it then be acceptable that s/he works part time. Working during the school holidays would also be acceptable as long as it does not interfere with their school curriculum. As this would promote independence and help the student prepare for his or her future. Other than these two reasons, college students should not let part time work be of distraction to their studies. The amount of school related stress from work and compulsory co-curricular activities is more than enough for a student to handle, which does not include study time as well as a student's own personal time. Even if a student admits to being able to juggle school work as well as a job, s/he should still not opt to work part time as studies would be more important as compared to a part time job.
