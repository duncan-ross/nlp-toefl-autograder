For nowadays, because of the economic problems, it makes the people receive the money less than before, the effect is affected to the students also. I think the students should have the part-time job. They can receive the extra money from that, and it can decrease the burden of their parents, that is a good thing to do. Almost of my friends they have a part-time job, in different job such as cinema officer, cashier, teacher and etc. Their salary is about 4000-5000 baht, Are you still thinking that is a bad idea? And they got the friends from another college also. They usually do it after the classes, they go to the mall or department store for working or someone will work in the holidays. The part-time job has many and many benefits, as long as it cannot be able to disturb their studying they should do, because they don't receive only the money but they can receive the experiences to go to work in the future, they have to meet a lot of people, of course they have different behavior. I'm sure that it can make them to be stronger. And the last important thing is they can buy whatever they want by themselves.
