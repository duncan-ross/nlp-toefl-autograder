When I see someone smoking, I always walk to the other side from that person. I think it's really bad to be nearly because the smoke from cigarette can't make me feel relax or good. So I feel that smoking in the restaurant can be dangerous for people. In smoke there is carbon monoxide or ammonium which could make the problems for the earth. Perhaps it can make the fire when smoking persons aren't careful. And the smoke can increase the earth temperature. That leads to be the global warming. Because in our earth there aren't enough trees to absorb the toxic gas and recycle them to be the fresh air. Furthermore, smoking is bad for people who smoke and people who surrounded by them because they can get all smoke into their body and smoke can cause lots of disease such as cancer, lung, stomach, liver, spleen and cardiovascular diseases. Then their health will get down and their life periods will be shorter than they can hope. In the other hand, if the restaurants want to have spaces for smoking, I think they should separate this part far from non-smoking persons. And they should have a system to clean and clear the air to be fresh air. There are many ways to do like that and the restaurant owners should have ideas. For me, I think the trees can do it. So I think we shouldn't smoke in the restaurant because we have to think about other persons around us and don't make them have bad health.
