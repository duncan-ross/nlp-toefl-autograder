I agree with students have part time job. These days in worldwide already all students have part time job. It is having a several reasons. First reason is to help their parents, due to expensive tuition; parents are working at workplace for students. So they are should do a little work. Second reason is experiencing a several works, to learn living way this society and to acquire tip of to survive the world. To learn these days how much do people are so selfishness, and students do these part time job. The last reason is in the future students for employment must service intern that relative to major. Recently many students are interning because for their specification. Collecting specification is rising among the companies as companies want to accomplish employees but I want for students only not doing to collect the specification. Accumulating students various experience to have challenge and passion. When they are doing they desiring work, I want to that students has more the dreams and more plentifully passion and desire, so more hard to study and to learn. As a result working students are very good in development of society and growth of themselves. I want a many students have part time job.
