Based on personal experience, I would have to agree. In this day and age, I believe that it is essential for college students to get as much'on the job' experience as they can get. We find ourselves in a highly competitive period of time. With the recent global recession, the situation has only worsened and the job market is even more competitive than it has ever been. I was laid off when my company went bankrupt and despite my IT degree, found myself suddenly jobless, along with thousands of others and my degree, while helpful, did not help me land my current position. I got this job because I held a part-time sales position while at college and after successfully completing my degree and waiting to take up a new position with an IT company, I spent several months working in sales again. This stood me in good stead as it turns out, because it was because of this sales experience, limited though it was, which helped me get the job I am in now. So yes, I would advise all college students that it is important to have a part-time job if for nothing else than to gain some type of work experience which may prove useful in the future, as it did for me.
