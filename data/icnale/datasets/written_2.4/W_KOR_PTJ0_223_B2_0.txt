I strongly disagree with the statement that it is important for undergraduate student to have a part-time job. The main reason why having a part-time job is not significant for college students is that their main role as a undergraduate student is to study academically their own major or other fields. Firstly, if college students had a part-time job, they would have not sufficient time to learn their discipline. Time is very limited to everyone, especially to students, and, these days, time management is getting more important than the past due to the rapid changing society. Generally undergraduate students have to take some general courses, which require a lot of time to study. In addition, they have tons of assignments for each class. Time to do part-time jobs would make college students take out their valuable time to study. Secondly, a part-time job distracts students' life. For example, if their job was related to personal relationship (e. g. , food serving or marketing using phone), it would be highly possible to be somethings wrong. When this happened, college students would have a problem spiritually and get stressed out. For those reasons, all things considered, having a part-time job is not a good idea for undergraduate students.
