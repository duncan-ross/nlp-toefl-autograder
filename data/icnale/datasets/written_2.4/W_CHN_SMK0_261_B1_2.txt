I never conceal my disgust at smoking. On my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in the whole universe, much less in public places. It is well-acknowleged that smokers are doing something relaxing at the expense of their health——even their families'. Everybody knows that smoking hurts lung, but in fact, it almost affects the whole body, greatly increasing the possibility of heart attacks and causing deafness, enteron deseases even cancers. What's worse, smokers will finally develop a denpendency on nicotine and become its slaves forever. Typical heavy smoker as my father is, he uses cigarettes to relieve his tiredness. And in turn, he will becom extremely upset and tired once a cigarette couldn't be smoked. That's why smokers always fail to give up smoking, knowing every disadvantages it brings. Smoking in public places just enlarges a personal problem and affect more people. Everyone smokes passively, everyone get unhappy and people's rights is torted. As far as I'm concerned, smoking in public places is not only a kind of immoral, a kind of disgrace, but also a kind of disobeying the spirit of law. I just feel terrible and can't help starting to cough when it comes that somebody standing by me is smoking. There're so many problems it is causing and why any of us should accept being affected by it? Allowing smoking in public places may also convey an attitutude that smoking is somehow be allowed, be admitted, and be understood. Smokers cannot feel the criticism from the society or even a little limit which would makes it even harder to for them to stop it. Undoultedly, apart from people don't smoke, it's also unfair and irresponsible to all the smokers. All above leads to the conclusion that smoking should definitely be forbidden in public places.
