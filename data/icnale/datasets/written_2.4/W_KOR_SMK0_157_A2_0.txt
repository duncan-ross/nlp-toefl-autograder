I agree. Quitting smoking in all restaurants in the country should be performed. Because the restaurant is a public place. So a lot of people use restaurant. In addition, people are eating foods there. However, if smoking will cause damage to many people, they are will feel uncomfortable and angry. Restaurant to cook with fresh foods and ingredients you have harmful tobacco smoke is not good for your health. And smoking in the restaurant itself is not a testament to other people. Not bad for people who smoke cigarettes, but smoking is even more harmful. Because children come to the restaurant to stop smoking in restaurants is not good. Some people like to smoke, but more people think there hates. It's going to damage them, and manners are not good. In addition, cigarette smoke, eat a meal in a restaurant is very harmful to health will be around the people hate. And will not be a good idea in view. If you want to go out and smoke will be smoking and not necessarily in a restaurant. I think damage too many people don't need to smoke. Therefore, for all of us completely ban smoking in restaurants will have to be.
