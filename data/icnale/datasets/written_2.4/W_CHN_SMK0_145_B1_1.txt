I agree with the idea because I think it is really bad to smoke in the public, such as restaurants. We all know that there are still many people smoke in the public, nowadays. It has many bad effects for all the people, not only yourself, but also the others. On the one hand, though people are finding it entertaining to smoke, it does harm in several ways. You will breathe bad air. In the same way, it will have bad effects on the people around you in the public places. From a professional standpoint, smoking in the public places makes everyday bad. On the other hand, it does harm to the atmosphere, and it will affect the environment, too. We all know that there are many people in the public places, so it is hard to make the air clean. After a long time, the air will become worse and worse. Maybe it can cause some diseases. In a word, it has many bad effects. We should control ourselves not to smoke in the public places. In conclusion, we can't smoke in the public places. Because there are many bad effects. Apart from the two bad effects, there are many other bad effects. So let's stop smoking in the public places.
