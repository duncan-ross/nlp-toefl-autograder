I think college student should have a part-time job because of three reasons. First, college students will have more experience except leaning in class. For example the students will know how to work with other people except friends in class, and if you are studying in the college that are in time that you should prepare yourself before go to see the real world. I think work part-time that is a way can help you. Second, college students will know it is not easy to earn money. The students will see a value of money, and they should be aware that how necessary to use money. College students will use money in the right way. Third, it is one way to help their parents to look for the money especially if your family is not so rich, it is important to help them by work in free time. For all of these reasons that are college students will learn more experience, will know the value of money, and help your family to look for money. Thus college students should have special work except learning in class. The best experience is something that you have to know by yourself, so one thing that will give you the best experience is part-time work.
