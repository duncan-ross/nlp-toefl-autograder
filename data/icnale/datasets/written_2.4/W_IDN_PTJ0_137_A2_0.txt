I think college students need to have part time job. A part time job can prepare them before entering the real world of work. Although the college will offer internship or apprenticeship, but I think they also need part time job, to give them more suitable work experience. Of course they will also get a lot of useful knowledge, that they are ready to face the working world developments later when they finish their studies. They will also meet many new friends. Could be later the new friends will invite them to open a new job, or may be the new friends could help them when they have a serious problem. Become college student requires a lot of money. Not only for registration, but for fulfillment of tasks, for buy books, for tuition fees and other purpose. Especially for those who are away from their parents and they have little pocket money they would need a part time job. Because from their part time job they can help ease the burden of their parents, and of course it can help their parents for their finance college. Salary of the part time job can increase the pocket money and could they save for other pressing needs.
