Today, many college students have part-time jobs. Some people think that a part-time job is important to college students because they think is essential part of the campus life and do good to our future. The other think that part-time job waste our times. Well, in my opinion, I don't think part-time job is important to us. I have two reasons. First, as a college student, our main duty is study. We only have 24 hours a day, we only have about 30 days a month, we only have 12 month a year, We only have 4 years in college. So time is precious, time is important to us. If we spend much time in doing part-time job, we have no time to study, that's not good. When we graduate from college, we may be too busy to study. So we should pay more attention to study, not part-time job. Second, as a college student, there is a little chance to have a meaningful part-time job. Think about it, you go to find a job such like waiter. This job has no relationship with the knowledge we learn. They do this job just for money. That's not a good phenomenon because we only can learn little thing from the job. Although part-time job has some advantages for us such like help us know this society and help us gain some work experience. But as a saying goes do right thing in right time. As a college student, we should put study at first part of our lives. So I think it's not important for us to have a part-time job.
