Yes, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. These part time jobs could include giving tuitions, working at food and beverages outlets or working in an office as an admin worker. College students may choose to have a part time job during holidays or even during school term. There are many advantages in having a part time job when the students are in college the following paragraphs we discuss on these benefits further. The first benefit would be work experiences for these young students who will be joining the work force in three to five years' time. The work experiences would be very valuable for them when they start working. The working experiences will help grow their ability to work as a team member and to be able to communicate well with others. They would also be able to learn life skills that would help them not only in their work but also in their relationship with friends and family. The second benefit would be that the student would have a stable income. This income could help to take off some burden on their family. The students would also learn to manage their own money which would be an important life skill to have. In conclusion I feel that it is very important for students to have a part time job during their college days. It would help them greatly in life and their work in the future.
