Smoking is one of the most serious problems in Hong Kong. There are more and more youngsters becoming smokers in recent years. Government starts to set up law to combat smokers. Government ban smoking in public area. But should smoking be completely banned in all restaurants? In my personal view, it should be banned in all restaurants. We all know how bad smoking is. Leading to a yellow teeth, uncomfortable smell, and high risk of cancer is common outcome of smoking. Worse still, smoking also leads harm to those people around smokers. It will also increase the risk of another people to suffer cancer. So it means that smoking is harmful to all people. It is reasonable to ban smoking in all restaurants to protect the health of all Hong Kong citizens. As restaurant is a public area, smokers have no right to affect others. And also it is a good way to combat smokers and prevent youngsters to become smokers. Firstly, smokers loss a comfortable place to smoke. As most of the company ban smoking, smokers will choose to smoke at lunch time. Restaurants become a common place for them to smoke reasonably. Ban smoking in restaurant makes them not available to smoke in lunch in order to reduce smoking. Youngsters also will have less chance to contact with smokers. In conclude, it should ban smoking in all restaurants.
