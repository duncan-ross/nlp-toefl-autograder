Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country I think smoking should be strongly banned at all restaurants in Taiwan or every country. "Smoking may cause cancer!" This is the warning sign on each cigarette cover. This warning sign is not only serious but trying to help smokers stop smoking. However, many smokers do not care about they health and even do not care about others health. Restaurant is a place that non-smokers can be seriously influenced by smokers. The reason is that restaurants are indoor area and the smoke cannot be blown by winds as outdoors. Thus, because of the air conditioner, the smoke will be always in the restaurant by circulation. And if people do not like the smoke in other place, they can wear masks, which is not able to use in the restaurant because they have to eat. The smell of smoking also makes non-smokers feel bad when eating. No matter how many non-smokers are there in the restaurant, probably only one smoker can ruin all the others meal. Therefore, I strongly recommend and hope that smoking can be completely banned at all the restaurants in Taiwan. It is not fair for non-smokers to share the cancer-caused smoke with smokers. When doing something which can affect not related people in negative way, this thing should be forbidden for sure.
