Smoking is to bad thing that the most people dislike but a few people still do it. The most people hate the cigarette's smoke because it is the source of lung's cancer. A few people are still smoking the cigarette because when they leave to stop smoking the will be clumsy and if they leave to stop for a long time they will crazy immediately. The cause is they cannot stop to leave the cigarette immediately so the smoking person who want to leave to smoke the cigarette should slowly leaving such as today you smoke 6 times per day and next week you should decrease smoking to 5 times per week and finally you can stop to smoke. This is another way to stop smoking a cigarette. The most people who have not smoke will think that the smoking person make the tedium for the pubic, that is the cause for the government notice the bad way of smoking cigarette by television and the billboard in anyway. some place you can not smoke if not they will fine but I never see the place that have person who smoke will be fine in Thailand. Because the Thailand law enforcement is not strict. To conclude, Smoking is a bad way in society but the cigarette can make the value in economic system so we can not deny them like the alcohol that have a stock in stock market also.
