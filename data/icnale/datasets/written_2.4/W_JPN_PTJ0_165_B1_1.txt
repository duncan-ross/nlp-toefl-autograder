I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons why I agree with it. First reason is that we can meet many people with it. I work a part-time job now for a restaurant. I like my work and work members. Through the job, I could make friends with variety kind of people. I think I'm very happy to meet them. Then, I like to talk with my guests. They are very kind and interesting. So I think it is very nice to have a part-time job. Second, we can have a lot of good experience with a part-time job. Thanks to the job, I think I became able to talk with people who I don't know at all in spite of my shyness. Now I can talk to various people with smile. Also I learned the way of speaking to my guests. The way of speaking is very important when we work for an office or a company in the future. The last reason is that we can change our view of life or value. I made friends with many people whose generation is different from me. I learned there is a lot of way of thinking. I feel my view of life changed and now I send better life. I thank my job members. In this way, I agree with the statement. If my friends don't have part-time job, I want them to have it.
