I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job. Most of our parents don't give us too much money. For example, I can 4000NT per month from my mother. But minus the daily basic meal costs and MRT costs, I only have 500NT left to watch a movie with friends or to buy CDs or other things. Apparently, that is not enough. Also, college students will soon join into social live and finding a formal job. If we college students don't get a part-time job and experienced working life, we must tend to be frustrated after we graduate and start working. Part-time jobs at school or near school are usually kind to students. Students can work at a relax environments, learn ways to deal with people and understand that if you want to buy something, you need to pay effort on it. Though part-time didn't really earn much, 3000-5000NT per month-maybe some people will earn even more-is enough. Through this process, college student will know that earning money is not easy, and will be precious the money their parents earn and things they have got. It is not only a good experience before graduate, but also a nice education. That's why I think part-time job is important.
