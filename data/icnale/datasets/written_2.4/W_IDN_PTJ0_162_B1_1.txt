For a college student, to have a part time job is not really necessary, but it worth to do it. First, part time job, will trained our abilities before the real job. Besides that, we can get some of new experience. Second, we can learn or become realize how hard our parent is working for us, so we can appreciate our parent's hard working. Apart from that we can learn independent, but it is not mean we are already do not need our parent's help. it is just training for us to not always spoiled and depend everything to our parent. Although we have part time job, but our priorities is not working, but studying as a college student. Some student may "sacrifice" their test for part time job. If that job have better opportunity to our future it is alright, but if that is not make better opportunities for our future, and make some wrong thinking for part time job, how it's become? It will make they purpose to working just to get money as much as they can, buy something not necessary that very expensive, etc. With that thinking, the purpose of part time job is become mess. So, in the end part time job have good and bad points, depending on how we see it.
