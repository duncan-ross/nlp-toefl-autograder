I agree because smoking in public is disturbing another people. Especially in the restaurant. People smoking for varies different reason some one smoking because they street out or they think they cool or very attractive for other people. But they don't think to another people that they make annoying to them especially people who don't smoke or they got allergies of smoke. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Cigarette and smoke can be effect to people who smoke inhaled because they inhaled smoke more than smoker. Completely banned smoking at public place it can help other people who do not smoke. And stop smoker to reduce smoking than past. For smoker, you must to quit smoking for your health and your mind. Stop smoking for your family and our social. If you can stop smoking, not only others will be happy, yourself will be healthy and you can live longer and not taking rise for having cancer. For restaurant, the owner should separate the place for smoking and non-smoking area. Don't let smokers go into the restaurant, you may lose other customers especially the air condition restaurant. The smell of the cigarettes will destroy the air, and smell of food. Therefore, everyone should consider what should we do with stop people having smoking in restaurant and public areas.
