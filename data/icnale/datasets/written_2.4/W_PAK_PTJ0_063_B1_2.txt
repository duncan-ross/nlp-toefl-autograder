Part time jobs are much common in western countries where every single person has to fulfill his expenses himself and no one is dependent on others. Even children's when inters to adoleson are supposed to earn and fulfill their requirements their self. Their parents do not support them anymore. But in our country Pakistan joint family system is common and all of the family depends upon one guardian who supports all the family. That's why part time job is not common here. But due to inflation in the country it is becoming very difficult for a single person to support the whole family. That's why now a days a lot of people can be seen doing part time job in our country also. Most of the students studying in the universities do part time job after their study hours to supports their family. As it makes a person all time busy and can affect their studies but they are compelled to do this for their family. Some of the people do part time jobs utilize their spare time in effective works and most of them join NGOs to help people of their country and to utilize their problems.
