The problem of smoking in the restaurant and another place is the main problem that causes a lot of problem to people. Many people who don't smoke will be boring about the smoker. The bad smell from the cigarette make the people in the restaurant annoy and don't want to eat anymore. This problem is hard to solve especially in the country that everything is easy and people don't like to follow the rules. Many smokers think it is cool to show other people that they can smoke and release the smoke to the air. In fact, this bad habit is hated by the people who don't smoke. When I go to do some exercise at the park or go shopping, I try to get away from the smokers. If I have to face with them, I will use my hand to cover my nose. I think that the bad smell from the cigarette make me have a headache. I also find that there are smokers in many restaurants they smoke on the walkways and talk loudly. These habits annoy me and other guests very much. I think that smoking should be banned in the restaurants.
