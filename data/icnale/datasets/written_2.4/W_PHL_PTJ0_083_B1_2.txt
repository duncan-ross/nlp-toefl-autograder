In Wikipedia, A part-time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. Workers spend 30 - 35 hours weekly just to earn money thinking that they cannot afford to work full-time in spite of their hectic schedules. Commonly, if we are talking to persons who are doing this the students are mainly involved. It is simply because we cannot manage to pay lot of bills and fees even though we have supports from our parents. College students especially those who are financially down are the one's needing this to support themselves for college schooling. They can be online advertisers, promodisers, salesladies or salesmen, or restaurant crews. I believe that the most in demand today in part-time jobs is being a restaurant crew. It is because managers and owners want active, speed, and refreshing workers just what we teenagers have. I experienced doing this during summer. My father employed me and my first work is to remove the paint on the walls. It took me 6 hours just to remove those paints of a 20 square meter wall. But it is definitely an experience and a hustle work just to earn 1000 pesos a week.
