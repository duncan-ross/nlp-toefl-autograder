In my opinion, It's very necessary that smoking should be banned in the restaurants in the country. In fact, I have many reasons for this view. As we all know, the world has a large number of smokers. They like to smoke anywhere include public places such as restaurants. Some smokers say that smoking can help them get away from stress, make them feel good, they said they enjoy the meals better after smoking. However, they didn't know that smoking is bad for their health and to others' health. It can cause lancer, and lead to heart problem. When people smoke in the restaurants, those non-smokers sit close to them become the victims. Many scientists say second-hand smoke that would greatly be harmful to people's health. Moreover, everyone hope to have meals in a clean restaurant. But smoker often throw matches and cigarettes on the ground, and this will bring many troubles to surrounding people. It can even cause fire disaster in the restaurant. According above statements, smoking should be banned in the restaurants because smoking is harmful to health, bad influence on non-smokers and the safety of people. Banned smoke can bring us comfortable eating environment in the restaurants.
