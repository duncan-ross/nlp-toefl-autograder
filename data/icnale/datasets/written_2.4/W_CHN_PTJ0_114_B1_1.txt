It's important for college students to have a part-time job. The followings are the possible reasons I think why having a part-time job is important for college students. Above all, in my opinion doing a part-time job can help shape ourselves. During the part-time job, it's obvious that we may face lots of tough problems which we have never dealt with. Through solving them, we gradually become mature and develop good personalities, such as brave, hardworking and optimistic. At the same time, taking a part-time job contributes to earning a certain amount of money. As college students, most of us have been teenagers and are not children any more. We should learn to take the responsibilities to help our parents. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a good way to relieve the burden of our parents. What's more, taking a part-time job requires us to go into society. We all know that society is a good teacher. In the society, we can acknowledge the things which cannot be taught at school, such as how to communicate with others. In the meanwhile, we can also apply what we have learnt from classes to practical situations. In this way we can get a better understanding of the theories. However, we should keep in mind that we just take a part-time job. It ought not to be turned into full-time. After all, studying is our first task. We should balance the relationship between studying and part-time job.
