More and more people addicted to smoking these days, especially the youngsters. It is almost known to all that smoking is bad for people'shealth. But why cannot they stop smoking? To the worse, many of them even smoking in public places, such as restaurants or parks. This behavior is not only harmful to themselves, but also the others surrounding them. It is very unfair to the people who have no choice but to smoke the second hand cigarettes. As we all know, the harm of the second hand cigarettes to people is greater than to smokers. To many people, smoking is a habit for daily life, so it is very difficult to give up smoking. But in the other hand, smoking is the very cause of many diseases, for example, the heart trouble or pneumonia. These diseases may cause to death at many time, so we should think more about this question, whether have smoking or not. Besides the reason of individual, the government should give more attention to the management and selling of cigarettes. In many illegal variety shops, cigarettes may be sold to everyone who wants to buy, no matter how old are they. This is very unreasonable. Laws have said many rules about smoking, but most of shopkeepers are prefer to choose the money, but not the care for teenagers or the development of our nation.
