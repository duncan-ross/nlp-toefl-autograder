Speaking of smoking, it let me think my father because he is addicted to smoke. From teenager to middle-ager, he always smokes after finishing every meal. My family was used to smelling this flavor, especially my mother. However, my little sister, she hates this flavor very much. Whenever my father smokes, she must rush in her bedroom to wear her mask, then goes back to living room with an angry face. There are a question has existed in my mind long time ago. Why still do lots of people to smoke even know it has no benefits? Although I don't hate the smell of tobacco, I can't stand smell the flavor when I was eating. Therefore I agree with smoking is banned at all the restaurants. Every time I see girls or boys smoking, I will be very disgusted at them, especially at a restaurant. In Taiwan, smoking in public places is forbidden; however, there still are many people do it. Therefore, I think the laws of forbidding smoking have to be more severe than old ones. And the punishments also should be stricter than old ones. Finally, I hope all of people who live in the country can follow the laws to provide a clean environment to enjoy fine food without stand stinky flavor.
