Recently, the government develop the law that bans smoking indoors. Some people support it, while some of the smokers are not happy about this. They think it restricts them and deprives of their freedom of smoking. As for me, I am one of the supporters who think smoking indoors should be completely banned, especially at all the restaurants. First of all, restaurants are places for people to have a meal, chat with friends, and take a rest. Restaurants supposed to be comfortable, cozy and clean. Smoking will totally destroy the quality of the food and affect the mood of the diners. Second, smoking does no good to people's health. People used to smoking have liver cancers at a high rate. That is to say, they have poor health than the normal people. What's worse, according to the research, people live with a smoker are more likely to have liver cancers than the smokers. Why? Because the instance that released by the smoking process are more dangerous. As a result, smoking in an indoor place such as restaurant is really selfish! Last but not least, smoking is a bad habit. If the law makes the smokers feel inconvenient to smoke, they don't smoke that often. It is an efficient way to reduce the number of the smokers. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country.
