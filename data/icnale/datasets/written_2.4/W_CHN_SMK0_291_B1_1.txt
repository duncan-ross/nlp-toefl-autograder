Nowadays more and more people smokes. We can see people smoke almost everywhere, and they seems to enjoying the feeling of smoking very much no matter what reaction they come across when smoking. Personally I don't think it interesting or cool to smoke, because I like breathing fresh air. I simply can't understand why people feel good to smoke in some "polluted" air. I do know the chemical stuff that burned tobacco releases have the effect of chairing people up, but for most of smokers it is not the chemical reaction the reason that they smokes but the image of smoking people are cool and grown-up, others may be smoking because of stress from life, rare as it is, still others are truly addicted to tobacco. Money spend on cigarettes is a fortune to any body, but they spend it on cigarettes day after day, even though they can save it or do some business with it. Despite its wasting money character is not favourable, the critical point is that it do harm people's health. When you smokes, you smokes in more than the inspiring chemical; you also takes in stuff that released when tobacco burns. Imaging what it is like when a forest catches fire, you can see thick smoke comes from burned plants, and that is, just a little bigger, exactly the same kind of stuff you breath in when smoking. So, although you may say it's hard to cut off cigarettes, you'd better do cut off them for your own health and people around you.
