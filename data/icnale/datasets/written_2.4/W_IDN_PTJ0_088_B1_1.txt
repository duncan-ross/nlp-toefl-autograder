Part-time job is one of a kind of job that always searched by college student. Usually it take in a spare time that used by college student to increase their income. It really good and I completely agree with this statement. It is important for college student to have a part-time job. I think it is not only important for them but also very nice. Part-time job have so many positive effect. Firstly, college student will have so many experience in their life. They can control their income and what they need. Moreover, college students can collect additional finance although they still depend on their parents. Secondly, college student fulfill their spare time. it is better than always waste the time by do nothing. Thirdly, college student can improve their skill and ability in other side of their jobs. They will have so many friends and network. But in other side it also have negative effect. Student college get in trouble if they can not control their team Their schedule collide with other activity, they also not focus with lesson and the last they will be so tired all the day. It is better if college student have a part-time job. But for the new students, I think it is better if they want to habit with the condition first.
