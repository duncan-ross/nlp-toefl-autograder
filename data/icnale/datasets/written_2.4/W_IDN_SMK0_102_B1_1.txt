Smoking is a bad habit. It is not good for the smoker. Both of the active and the passive smoker get the negative effect. The active smoker actually broke his/her body, specially broke his or her lungs. The passive smoker who does not smoke directly also get the broken lungs. How can? It is because they breathe the smoke from the active smoker. Not only the cigarette but also the smoke cause the cancer. That is why, if we want to keep our cancer healthy, we must stay away from smoking. Do not ever smoke and make a space from the active smoker. Restaurant is a public place. It is for all the people without exception for eating or enjoying lunch and dinner. In a public place, we should have a good attitude. How about smoking in the restaurant? I think it is not polite attitude. As we know that smoking brings many dangerous effects, so we should honour the other people who are in the restaurant too. The smoker is still want to smoke but there are some people do not like smoking. In my opinion, the wise solution is the government do not have to ban smoking in restaurant but they should make a private place for smoker in every restaurant – a separate room for smokers.
