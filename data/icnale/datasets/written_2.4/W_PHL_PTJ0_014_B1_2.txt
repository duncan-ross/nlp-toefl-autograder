College. Another stage of our life that helps us gains new knowledge about different things. It is the time when we started to be serious in our studies because this stage determines what we will be in the future. This stage also helps us to be more independent and responsible in every action we do. But not all of us can be in this kind of stage in our life. There are things that hinder us to be in college like poverty. In the Philippines, college students are forced to work at the same time just to continue their studies. For me, part time jobs will greatly affect the studies of college students. They will have hard time in focusing in their lessons because of their jobs. There is a high possibility that the students will have lack of sleep because of their work. Instead of listening to their professors, they may fall asleep during their classes. However, there are students that can manage both work and studies. They can adjust easily to their work and be able to prioritize their studies. Part time jobs can have negative and positive effects to college students. It just depends on the students on how they will manage their life.
