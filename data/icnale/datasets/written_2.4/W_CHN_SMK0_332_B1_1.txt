The addiction to the cigarettes belongs to many people. And when it comes to the argument whether to forbid the smoking completely, the people can't make the same decision. Some agree when others are against. In my opinion, I think the cigarette should be forbidden. The cost of cigarette is a large burden,. Many people, including the poor man, spend thousands of money buying cigarette. It's a huge payment that most people can't afford. Maybe government can gain a lot from the trade. But in my mind, nothing can weight more than the better life of civilians. So the government abandon their small profit and forbid smoking immediately. Less smoking, less conflagration. In due time, every firing cigarette can burn down a town.. And most people won't put out their cigarettes, especially in the desert and forest, where there can have a fire easily. So influenced by the spread of no smoking, fireman's work won't be so busy anymore. Last and the most importantly, following the increasing of smokers' number, the amount of cancer patients also grow rapidly. Most lung cancer patients have several decade history of smoking. So for everybody who want to have a long and high-quality life it a must to give up your smoking habit. And if a smoker who had known that smoking can harm other people's health still stick to smoking, he may be too selfish. So considering the health of you and people around you, smokers should give up smoking. The three reason I listed above has explain my view. The policy forbidding smoking can benefits many people. So the government should put it into practice as soon as possible.
