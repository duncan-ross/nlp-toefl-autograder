I don't think it is a good idea to ban smoking in all restaurants. Well, some people might argue that all public places should ban smoking because it affects non-smokers too through second-hand smoking. However, I think differently. I think public places should be places where all people can enjoy their freedom. Restricting smokers to smoke would be depriving their freedom. On the other hand, some people argue that public places are for all and that by allowing smoking, it is upholding only one side of the argument. This is no doubt true, too. By allowing smoking in public places, non-smokers are directly affected by the smoke. They inhale the smok, e and this can be more harmful than smoking cigarette themselves. It is understandable why some people support prohibition of smoking in public places. But, if we ban smoking, that would only be considering non-smokers side too. The smokers are deprived of their freedom in public places. Therefore, it is necessary that we find a way to satisfy both sides. So, for a perfect solution, I think there needs to be a compromise. One of them could be dividing the restaurant into non-smoking area and smoking area. By doing this, smokers can go to a smoking section and enjoy their freedom, while non-smokers can sit in a non-smoking section where they won't get affected by it. Through this way, it can uphold both sides of the argument, and it is fair enough.
