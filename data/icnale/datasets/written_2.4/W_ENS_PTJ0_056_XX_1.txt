I think that college students who work while they attend school have a very good idea. I recently read a study in which it was shown that students who work approximately 10 hours per week actually have increased academic performance over their counterparts who don't work. At this level of work, the only thing that the student is replacing his own schedule is usually time that he or she has wastes by doing things such as watching television or goofing around. Thus, as long as students can find a balance like this that works for them, there are no negative effects of having a part-time job. However, some students have to work fulltime all they attend college, and all of these people report that having a fulltime job while trying to attend classes is simply too much to deal with. Some of these people have no choice as they will have no other way to pay for their college tuition, and many of them drop out because they find that work is more important than school. But the money they might turn at the fulltime job over a few years pales in comparison if the money they can earn if they have a real career. Therefore, students should stick to part-time work during college.
