I agree with the statement because having part time job can make a college student learn so many things and of course to earn money. Getting a part time job is an opportunity for us to experience what having a job feels like and may come handy in the future. When you're having a part time job, you will learn so many things like discipline and perseverance because in a job you need to follow the rules and will make a good impression to the boss. Having a part time job can have also many benefits like health insurance, dental, medical, vision and many more. The downsides of having part time jobs is that you're always tired and need to manage the times when you need to finish a school project or homeworks; nevertheless, you are only experiencing what will happen in the future and feel proud of yourself because you can balance school and work. Having a part time job is also fun because you will also meet many friends and different kinds of people which is a good experience. Of course when you talk about part time jobs you're also talking about money. Money is the reason most of the students take part time jobs because there are so many reasons like financial problems, for experience purposes, to have fun, to earn extra money and many more.
