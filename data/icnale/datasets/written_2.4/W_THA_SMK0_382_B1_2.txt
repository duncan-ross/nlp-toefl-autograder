I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, in fact, in all of the restaurants everywhere in the world because restaurant is the place where people come for eat out so they want to enjoy their meal, enjoy their meeting, spend their time together, and etc. So restaurant should be the place that must be clean in every part as much as it can be. Smoking in the restaurant is such an annoying problem and it is not hygienic for other people who are in the same area with the smokers who do not care anybody else. Do not forget that smoking causes cancer not only the smokers will get sick from it but also the people who stay around the smokers because the air they breathe is not clean and it is full of the pollution from the smoking which will causes cancer even they do not smoke. So see that it is not fair for other people who just come and want to eat happily in the restaurant. I think, if possible, the restaurant should provide the smoking area outside of the restaurant to avoid the problem. In conclusion, for the people who love smoking, when you go to the restaurant, please go to the smoking area so that you can enjoy smoking just for yourselves.
