I absolutely agree with this topic. Smoking in some public places should be banned because it can cause to people health. All the smokers must be banned in restaurants, shopping malls, college and parking. Therefore, the way can reduce this problem is to inform all smoking people what are danger, ill effect and punishment of the smoking. Nobody would have harmful things around them. There are many reasons to ban smokers at all the restaurants in the country Smoking not only kills you but other people. Smokers are breathing in smoke not oxygen similar to their lungs are set to be used for. The lungs shouldn't get atmosphere pollution. If a lot of people are in the restaurant and there is only one person smoke in that place, the smoke can be danger and also spread to all people around that place. It's not fair for people who do not smoke to must get risk. The smoke can affect people who may be pregnant because pregnancy can obtain disease simply. It can also make hair smell terrible. There are many health problems form smoking, all cigarettes do is destroy lungs and put a higher risk for cancer. The most importantly, Smoking can kill every people around the world and our family.
