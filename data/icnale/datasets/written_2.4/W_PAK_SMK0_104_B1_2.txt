Tobacco smoking is the practice where tobacco is burned and the vapors either tasted or inhaled. When people has formed an uncontrollable dependence on cigarettes to the point and stopping smoking would cause several emotional, mental or physical reactions then they have became addicted to it. Everyone knows that smoking is harmful and addictive, but few people realize just how risky and addictive it is. The question arises that although it is socially discouraged but still people smoke. Why? The reason that young people smoke is that they believe smoking is a symbol of adulthood. It is reinforced by advertisements from cigarette companies. The advertisers try to give the impression that maturity, social status, happiness and success are linked with smoking. However, surveys have shown that many young people smoke in order to cover up for their weakness or shortcomings. Many young people start smoking out of curiosity that what smoking is all about. Unfortunately cigarette contains drugs that are addictive, and so smokers find it difficult to give up smoking. Some people give reasons that why the continue to smoke are that smoking is stimulating and that it relieves tension, depression or even boredom but actually these are just psychological effects. People who need to smoke a certain number of cigarettes in a day at particular times, e. g. after a meal, have already formed the habit. If the do not smoke at those times, they feel that something is missing.
