I agree with the statement. Think about to promote the work that can earn money to support themselves. You can make many friends. Can bring knowledge to use in everyday life. Promote this is not difficult to find. Which is everywhere in our country. But some people have their main occupation. Supplement this work can be classified in several categories using both Internet. I am a person who worked to supplement and told that she has a good kind of work. I am a student I need to supplement existing work to earn money for themselves. Supplementary work, we have learned many of the services and management, but I belong to a service like my own because it is a cheerful person like say love to talk. Operating income supplement that I've done it about 2000 Baht is not fair for the money that me. I still have parents assist financial operation, but added some of this, I guarantee that it is great for me to have a part time job and not only me for all students who wish to have experience and new friends. We must dare to think out of the box and try to do something challenging. Having part time job could be one of them to enhance your abilities.
