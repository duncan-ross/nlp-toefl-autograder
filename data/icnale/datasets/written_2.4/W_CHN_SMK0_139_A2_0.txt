Today, we can see more and more young people smoking in the public places such as street and restaurants and so on. However, I don't agree with this behave. Some people think about complete ban of smoking in all the restaurants. I agree with it because it is a good idea to do it. There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Smoking cause a lot of disease such as lung cancer and it harm the non-smoker more than smoker. When eating in a restaurant, the non-smokers have no place to go if smokers smoke around them. What's more smoke does harm the environment in the restaurant, it causes the air pollution and something else in the restaurant. How can you enjoy your meal if you eat in this restaurant?Second smoking may bring fire to people in the restaurant. It may cause fire when someone litter the cigarette around and the worst thing is the fire burn the house and hurt the people in the restaurant. So we should against smoking in the restaurant, since it brings a lot of bad things to us. Finally, I appeal to all people to give up smoking not only for you but your family members.
