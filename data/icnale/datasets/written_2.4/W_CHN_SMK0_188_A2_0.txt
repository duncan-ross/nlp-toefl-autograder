Many years ago, the European has claimed smoking should be banned in the public places. This law considers smoker's health and the people who don't smoke and the place making. There is an argument about whether smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. In my opinion, it should be banned. Firstly, we are aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking causes cancer, and heart disease. It can shorten your life by 10 years or more. So, smoking too much is bad for your health. You should consider your health. Secondly, in the restaurant, there are a lot of people. It affects the health of others. Second hand smoke contains hundreds of bad chemicals. This also causes their health problem like cancer. Non smoker should not suffer this unfair treatment. For secondhand smoke cause more danger than the smoker. Finally, smoker also spends large numbers of money. The money in smoking can be used in many useful ways. It can not be just used in such way. Indeed, I don't agree with people can smoke at the restaurant. In the public place, you have the right to smoke, but you should consider other's felling. If you can't quit smoking, you should find a place belongs to you for smoking. Please don't smoke at the restaurant.
