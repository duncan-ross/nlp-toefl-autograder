There are a lot of smoke-free areas at restaurants, cafes, movie theatre, and pubs in many countries. Some countries hold that smoking in public places should be forbidden by law for people's health, while others insist that people have the rights to smoke even in public places in terms of freedom, economic effects, and overestimated data. However, smoking should be banned in public places all over the world since passive smoking could cause serious health problems and the policy prohibiting smoking in public places could help smokers reduce or quit smoking, enhance performance in workplaces and be helpful in terms of economic effects and the people's rights. Second hand smoke in public places could harm people's health. It could have been associated with a lot of diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, lung cancer and heart disease. Especially, passive smoking is dangerous for pregnant women, fetuses and children. According to an article, second hand smoke can reduce the chances of getting pregnant and increase the risk of pregnancy complications. In addition, second hand smoke can cause miscarriage. All in all, although some countries allow smokers to smoke in public places in terms of freedom, economic effects, and overestimated data, smoking should be prohibited in public places all over the world. That is because second hand smoke could cause a lot of dangerous diseases, and the no-smoking policy in public places could give smokers a motivation to reduce or quit smoking, increase performance in workplaces, and be efficient in terms of the people's rights and economic effects. These merits make more countries try to forbid smoking in public places.
