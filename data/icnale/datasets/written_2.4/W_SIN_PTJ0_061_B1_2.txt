I disagree to a certain extent. At this age, studying is more important than having a part-time job. Working is a life-long process but studying is not. Students should make full use of this golden opportunity to focus on their studies and achieve good grades for their future. This may enable them to apply for scholarships to further studies or work in reputable companies. They may be able to earn more and buy the things that they desire to compensate for their hard work over the years. When students have a part-time job, they may get distracted from their studies as they want to focus on earning more money to buy the things that they desire. This may cause them to neglect their studies and their grades may be affected badly which will be reflected on their transcripts. Upon graduation, they may not be able to enroll in good schools for further studies or work in good companies. However, some students may need to have a part-time job as their families are unable to provide for their school fees. They may work as long as their studies are not affected. For example, I had to work part-time during my polytechnic days as my parents were unable to afford my school fees. I ensured that the part-time job would not affect my studies. I would only work on the weekends during school days but I would work almost every day during semester holidays. I quitted my part-time job eventually as my studies were affected.
