Yes, I think that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan as well as restaurants everywhere. Myself and many of my girlfriends think that smoking is one of the most unattractive things a man can possibly do, so for both of our sakes I think we should just make it easier to not even have to think about that. Also, smoking can cause many forms of cancer as well as causing heart problems and other lung problems which are best avoided if you want to have a full and fulfilling life. Along a similar note, smoking can cause people around you to develop the same problems that they would if they were smokers themselves, and so it is very rude to do something that makes a decision for everyone else as well. I consider myself to be sort of a gourmet individual, and so I have very strong opinions on this issue because cigarette smoke is one of the most unforgettable mistakes a restaurant can make. Any high class restaurant that allows smoking just so they can make a few extra dollars on the bill of the smokers is simply crass. Conclusively, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
