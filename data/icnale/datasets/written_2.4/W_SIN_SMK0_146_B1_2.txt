 I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. I would like to first say that this opinion is made with self-interest because personally, I'm a non-smoker who absolutely DO NOT enjoy inhaling second-hand smoke when I'm dining in a restaurant, neighbourhood coffee shop - or while I'm waiting for a bus at the bus stop. I'm very aware of the carcinogens present in cigarettes and second hand smoke --- which is why I agree that such a ban should be imposed in all restaurants in Singapore to prevent smokers from imposing negative externalities on others. Currently, the ban we have for neighbourhood coffee houses are extremely superficial because while sections of the dining area are designated as "smoking corner" --- diners would all agree that such corners do not exist because smoke DIFFUSES and an invisible boundary marked by a "non-smoking" sign has no part in preventing the stench of smoke from spreading throughout the dining area from the "smoking" corner. With the ban, majority of local and foreign diners alike would be able to enjoy healthy dining even in neighbourhood districts. That said, I believe more should be done besides the ban because even a complete ban of smoking in all restaurants in the country may not be enough to prevent people from breaking the law and smoke in local coffeeshops. Owners of restaurants may close an eye simply because they want to keep frequent customers.
