I disagreed that smoking in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place for everyone eating rather than smoking. According to the recent research, people die from lung cancer is the top one of leading cause of death and smoking is major reason. Smoking is not just harm yourself but also harm other. Secondhand smoke is a disease which mean a person who breathe in tobacco from someone who are smoking. Although there are many bad affect about smoking, smokers still can't get rid of smoking. Just like a drags that cause them couldn't reject it. So we can't forbidden them smoking but we must protect our basic safety. Banning smoking in the restaurants is good for everyone. For us, we don't have to worried about breathe in tobacco. For smokers, this movement will give a notification in a mild tone. Let them know they are not welcome when they are smoking. In the restaurant, you can contact with you family, classmates or colleagues, you can have a good time enjoy the meal with a soft music, getting rid of the day's fatigue. If someone smoking, it will definitely destroy this wonderful atmosphere. So it has a necessary to be completely banned at all the restaurants.
