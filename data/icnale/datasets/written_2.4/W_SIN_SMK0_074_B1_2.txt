Smoking has been around for ages. Although considered unhealthy in theory, many individuals still choose to smoke. This is similar to many products such as alcohol and narcotics. Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants because the emission of second hand smoke is detrimental to other people nearby. In fact the act of taking in second hand smoke is almost as bad as smoking the cigarette directly. For people that detest smoking, the smell that lingers on even after the cigarette is snuffed can be unpleasant when visiting the restaurant. The dust particles that come from smoking can also make the air dirty and possibly contaminate the food. These harmful effects are magnified with the young as well as the elderly. However, to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country might be too extreme. Certain pubs would be frowned upon if smoking were banned. This is because social norms have already been established and breaking it might encounter huge resistance. Furthermore if it was done with people that do not mind smoking, the effects are less negative. In conclusion, a consensus is first needed to establish designated areas. Perhaps timeframes and areas could be put in place to guide the public on smoking in restaurants. Nevertheless its still important for the public to be educated on the actual effects of smoking as an ultimate goal.
