As a college student myself, I do not have a part-time job. It is not something that I regard as absolutely necessary or high on my priority list. College is a time for discovery and taking on new adventures. Going overseas during the summer breaks, getting acquainted with new people, as well as increasing my academic knowledge, are more important that having a part-time job to me. Having a part-time job is not only time-consuming; it is also tiring and stressful. However, there are many reasons why many college students do partake in part-time jobs. Firstly, it is for financial reasons. College fees are expensive and not every household is able to afford the high costs. Therefore, many college students are forced to have a part-time job in order to pay their tuition fees. Another reason why many college students have part-time jobs is because of the work experience. Similar to internships, taking up part-time jobs give college students an insight into working life as well as an idea of the mechanics of the working world. This would be a truly valuable experience to the students when they seek employment in the future upon graduation. Not only would they have an edge in terms of their work experience, the many skills they have picked up along the way would also allow them to outperform peers who are entirely new to the working world. Therefore, although having a part-time job may not be important to me, having a part-time job is not a bad idea as it has its own advantages.
