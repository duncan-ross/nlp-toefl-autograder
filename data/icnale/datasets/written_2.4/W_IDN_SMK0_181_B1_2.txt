Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in this country, well I think smoking should not be completely banned in every single restaurants in this country. Because believe it or not I think more than 50 % (percents) of peoples (former residence) in this country still need some spaces for smoking. When smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants it will reduce their customers. It is better if all the restaurants still make some special room for smoking area for their customers. It will be good for the smokers, and also not seriously harmed for people around them (smokers). With this every customers that still need to smoke can do their activity, and customers that no need to smoke( not smoking one) can do their activity without feeling disturb for the customers that smoke in that restaurants. But as my experience, in other country that have growth so well in their economic in the world, Our neighbor, Singapore. We, smokers ( I am also a smokers !) do not have some or much space for our activity, smoking. In every single high and fabulous (magnificent) buildings that they have in their country, even flat for living, shopping centre, their giant hypermarket they do not provide smoking area in their buildings. We must go outside the buildings to do our activity. We are not allowed to smoke there, smoking seriously harmed. They also fine people that breaking that rules 1. 000 SGD.
