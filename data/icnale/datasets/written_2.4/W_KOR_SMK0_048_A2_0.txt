Passive smoking and risk of harm to others illustrates. The perils of secondhand smoke A lot of people who do not know it, you need to stop smoking in public places and restaurants to think. Nice and tasty food to eat are we doing when we smoked at the next table will be happy. If you feel bad to do good to each other's it do not think it. And you want a pleasant atmosphere in any restaurant. However, a side table filled with smoke from a cigarette you will feel if you do not want get into a restaurant. Cigarette smoke is harmful to children and the elderly too much. Damage compensation if we go to them, how would you do? To do this requires non-smoking. And the smoke itself is harmful to the body of rotting lungs. So these are my thoughts. Booking agent for the health of each other in order to agree that smoking in restaurants. Thanks for listening, in my opinion is an awful lot.
