For study at school or university, we must spend a lot of money. We pay for food, transport, books, equipment, apartment or studio etc. Some parent have money for support their kids, opposite if some parent have not money for support them. What they can do for study in the college? Now, the poor students have many ways to find money for studies in the college, for example; loan for student's loan, get the scholarships or have a part-time job. If  the loan not enough for pay every thing when we study at the college, the scholarship not enough for every student, we can have a part-time job. In the city, it easy to have a part-time job. We can work at 7-eleven, Mcdonald's, KFC, The Pizza, in the restaurant. We can delivery pizza, newspapers or work like a messenger. If we study in the country, we can work at the restaurant or work in the college. We erne money from the job, we have an experience too. We must organize the time for class and time for work. We know people when we work. However, If you are the rich student, you can have a part-time job like the students in USA or Europe for learn the people, develop your EQ, human relationship and have a good experience too.
