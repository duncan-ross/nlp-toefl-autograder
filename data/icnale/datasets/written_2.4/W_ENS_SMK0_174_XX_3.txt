Well they have a lot of bans in the USA about smoking now so I don't see why Japan shouldn't do the same. I mean smoking is a real 'drag' anyway and I am sure that I am not going to throw my dollars away on something that is going to kill me. Not much point in doing that now and I would rather spend it on my music anyway. Most of my buddies think the same as I do. And even though my dad still smokes, he is always telling me to don't start smoking and I wonder why he just doesn't stop. I guess that it is pretty hard to do from what I hear. I think that the bans are a good thing and that they might help people like my dad cut down at least, as well as make the restaurants and clubs smell a bit fresher. I am not too sure where else the people can go to in Japan to smoke aside from those smelly glass rooms that smell like giant ashtrays. I think that they maybe should think about giving the smokers a better smoking room so they don't have to stay outside in the rain or snow like they do here.
