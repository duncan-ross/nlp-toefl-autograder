No, It should not banned all the restaurant. Because nowadays in this world in each country still has the smoker all around the corner. And they have the right to be the restaurant's customer. But I think the Government or any organization that may concern should build the law or rules about smoking in the restaurant it should have order to organize the specific area or build the small room for smoker in each restaurant. Or build the specific restaurant for only smoker. But in all of these cases the smoker should be aware and realize to the other that can be affected from smoking of them. But in the other hand, the Government should be strict with the law for smoker that smoking in the public place or the forbidden area. If they against the law they should be punished follow the law such as pay the fine. However in the best way every smoker should pay respect for the law and the other personal right and should be smoke in the right place and right time for good reason to spend the life in public place. And in every place not just the restaurant should be strict with law too. If anyone in any place find the smoker that against the law or rules they can sue or punished the smoker follow the law or rules.
