Restaurants are public places and pollution free. atmosphere within the restaurant will need to be eaten fresh. In each meal, food is useful to the human body. Therefore, restaurants will be an atmosphere of purity and pollution free. Smoking in restaurants and destroying the atmosphere polluting the restaurant. Will receive guests in the restaurant from cigarette toxins in to the body. To eat each meal, or in public places. We want to be clear, fresh and good atmosphere free from dust, pollution and smoking. Manners in a restaurant environment destroying themselves and others. And also interfere with other people. Enables consumers to store food poisoning in tobacco smoke into the body. Causing the aircraft to beam other customers and consumers lose the atmosphere of eating food. Smoking should be smoking in a smoking but not smoking where smoking is prohibited. In cigarette smoke contains nicotine which is toxins to the body. When smokers go very will accumulate toxins in the body and will harm the body as a substance causing lung cancer and other intestinal finally died in the end. So I do not agree with smoking in restaurants. It will not only harm themselves but also harm other around the beam and lost body build in a restaurant with atmosphere.
