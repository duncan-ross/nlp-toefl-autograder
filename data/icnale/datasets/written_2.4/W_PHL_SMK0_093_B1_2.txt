Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking has long been an issue among the society; it's one that continues to haunt us even though how hard we try to avoid it. Many campaigns or programs have already been developed or implemented to give smokers their own areas to smoke, however, some still continue to not follow the rules. According to most smokers, they don't see the need to isolate themselves from others when they are smoking, however this is a sign of disrespect to other non-smokers. Given these, one should stand bounded by these rules to ensure that good social graces are exercised among the community. Regarding the complete banning of smoking in restaurants, I happen to agree with this. When we go to a restaurant, we would often expect our area or eating to be appetizing or inviting, cigarette smoke is definitely something we are looking forward to when are stomach are grumbling and ready to eat. Besides, who are often seen in restaurants—families, with children. Harming yourself might be your own issue, however, harming another person whether intentionally or unintentionally is never right. The said banning may seem like a problem concerning only smokers, but it actually goes down to a deeper issue of respecting others even in simplest ways to make sure that the country withholds its good morale.
