In most cases, I agree that university students should have a part time job. It is because most students have to find a job directly after their graduation and, at the beginning, students may choose their major just according to their academic results without thinking about which kind of jobs that they will mostly encounter after choosing that major. In other words, they may even know almost nothing about the nature of the job such as the working environment, hours etc. Hence it is necessary for students to have a try during their study so that they can decide whether they should change their major, and thus have more chances to equip themselves to match the jobs that they are interested in. Taking Civil Engineering as an example, it is a well-paid job requiring students to deal with many physics, mathematics, programming etc, and it has very great contributions to the society and the world. However, this does not mean that it is suitable for most students who like the above things since it requires students to work in construction site where not every students who love the about subjects can bear. Even students love the major that they are studying, there are various possible paths of that major just as the case in BBA. Part time job can thus provide more opportunities for them to know more different paths, and they will not be easily confused by the wide variety after their graduation. The exceptions are those who decide to have post-graduated study. Instead of working experiences, what they need more are academic results as well as research experiences. By the way, working experiences, part time jobs, are really important to the students since university is the final station before the society.
