I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because our government should take more strict method to protect the right of the people who don't smoke. I think the smokers should respect the right of the people who don't smoke. The smoker may think smoking is a relax activity, but it is a torture to the people who don't smoke. The smell of the smoke is awful and hard to endure. The smoke will cling to our clothes. So the smoke is really a nightmare. I think another reason why the government should ban smoking at closed space is health. There are many essays showing that cigarettes are bad for our health and the statistics prove that smoke directly lead to the lung cancer. The evidence shows that the second-hand smoke is more poisonous than the smoker inhale. Though the packing of cigarettes show the slogan, it doesn't have the effect. The government also raises the price of cigarette, but the customers don't change their habit of smoke. It forces the government to use stricter measure to regulate the smokers. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country to protect our right and health.
