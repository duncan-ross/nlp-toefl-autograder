Over the years, people have been accustomed to smokers. We see people smoking in the streets, in schools and even in their own homes. And through the years, I myself know how much smokers love what they do. And through my personal experience with smoking, and through my peers, I can personally say that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. First of all, not all people smoke, so it is unfair for the non-smoking customers to end up being second hand smokers. In all means of smoking, if there are people around you, they tend to inhale the smoke surrounding them, making them second hand smokers. No matter how unintentional this is, second hand smoking is more dangerous than first hand smoking and has worse effects than it. Next, even if everyone is okay with smoking, there are children that will eat in restaurants. This will result in an increase in lung problems in children, and eventually decrease their lifespan. Not only is this the case, but more children will be smokers in the future because of its commonality. Lastly, it is simply unconventional and unethical for people to smoke in restaurants. Smoking while exposing food may contaminate the it, poisoning many of the customers, leading in a decline of the amount of people eating in the restaurant. No one likes the taste of cigarettes while eating a meal, no matter if you are a smoker or not. Overall, it is never a good idea to allow smoking in restaurants because of its multiple negative effects, and lack of purpose.
