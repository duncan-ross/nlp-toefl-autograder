I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, as we all know, smoking has a lot of disadvantages for smoker himself, his family and the environment. Especially, the public places, for example, in the restaurant. It is quite easy for people to addict to it. Smoking is bad for one's health especially for the lungs. One survey shows that people's lungs who have smoked for decades are covered with black things which may decrease life. In addition, smoker set a bad example for the young people, if they smoke in public places. For the adults, they resort to cigarettes and try to find some comfort to divert them in another direction when they have worries. However, teenagers admire the adults. Then they may mislead them. After all, restaurants are public places. In public, people should behave well and be polite. It is generally accepted that smoking is a bad habit, a waste of money and more importantly, does harm to one's health. One may have one thousand reasons to smoke, but which is more important, the short time pleasure on the one hand, or the health of oneself, of one's parents, friends, and children on the other?People cannot do anything on their own will. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
