Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country simply because restaurants are for eating while smoking areas are for smoking. There is a proper place for the right activity. Besides, who would want to smell second hand smoke while eating? Not only is it dangerous to the health, it is unappetizing. Moreover, assuming the role of the smoker, why would I eat while smoking? It is illogical. Imagine yourself going into a restaurant to eat. You smell the smoke, yet you can still resist it, so you proceed. While eating, you cannot smell the food because the smell of second hand smoke is stronger. You lose your appetite and left the restaurant, vowing to never come back ever again. You visit another restaurant yet the scenery repeats. In a parallel universe, imagine the country with a strict implementation of the no smoking policy in the restaurants. The world will be a better place for everyone, except for the smokers, of course. There is no doubt that the world will be a better place if this will be implemented. So what if the smokers lose a place to smoke? It discourages them from smoking thus preventing damage to their health.
