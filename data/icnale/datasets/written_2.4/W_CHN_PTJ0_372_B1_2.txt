I agreed with it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion college is such an important course. Because when we graduated from college. We may face the choice to go to institute or to become a fresh graduate. It is very precious to have a chance to get a part-time job. Because its experience will become a great reference when we have a job in the future. But don't forget our duty, we are students. So we should choose the job wisely. First, we have to know clearly that the part-time job not only just for the money to release our financial pressure but also get some experience to let our vision widely. Second, don't spend too much time on the part-time job, we are students not workers. Don't spend too much time on the job. We should make a balance between study and job. Third, choose a job which can give you more experience, inspire. Like school's librarian instead of strain store staff. Part-time job have a lot of benefits. Apparently, we can earn more pocket money, making new friends and most of all we may find a way about what we want to do in the future.
