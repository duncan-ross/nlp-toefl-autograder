Some people may argue these days that students should not take part-time jobs while attending college, but I disagree. I think that a large majority of students want to work anyway, for many reasons. Perhaps it may be to assist with repaying their parents for funding their education or maybe they need to pay for self-funding. Regardless of their motives, working part-time, aside from the monetary gains, allows students to gain important professional, social skills not found in college. By that I mean, how to conduct themselves and interact within the work environment. If it is their first job, then they will also learn organizational and time management skills which they will surely need if the intend to work and study at the same time. They may even be fortunate enough to be employed in an area that is connected to their studies. If not, then any form of legal employment would be beneficial to them in one way or another. If they plan their time accordingly, it will still leave ample time for social activities, extra studies or even take on supplementary short courses that compliment their career goals if they choose to do so. The positives of being employed early in their careers, far outweigh any negative arguments to the contrary.
