I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I am one of the students who do this. I can archive more experiences than my friends who haven't done. I think having a part- time job could give and improve your skill. I do many part- time job such as teaching, to look after children, car washing, volunteer, waiter, delivery man. I do this because these job will give the experience that have more valuable than salary. Teaching give me an communication skills and kind for hope your student to be better. To look after children give me How to control and know children?. Car washing give me about cleaning that is important for working in every type of work. To be a waiter give me about How to control your emotion? and service skill. These are my experience that I think it is valuable and good. Students can use this time to try to work, like to warm yourself before play a match. And the university may help the students to introduce the part-time job and support them to do. Finally the students will learn by their experience.
