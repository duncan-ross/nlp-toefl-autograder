I think it is quite important for college students these days to take a part-time job when they have free time. Taking a part-time job is meaningful and important; also it is a thing one should take serious. Needless to say, a part-time job can share our bills, improving our life, which means a lot to those in needs. To some extent, a decent job broadens our horizons; add to our understanding and experience of the society. What is more, it even helps to build up our confidence and interests. Moreover, a job enables you to make acquaintance of all kinds of people who will prove a great treasure to us later. On the other hand, as a student, study comes first. Failing to balance jobs and study, you will get nowhere. Anyway, I find it desirable to take part-time job at a proper stage. For example, as a freshman, a part-time job is an excellent choice to enrich your life. After that, you will get busier and busier. Obviously, it will be unwise of you to do it then. In a word, a part-time job is a wonderful thin itself and even more wonderful if we acquire the competence to balance it and our study.
