I'm agreeing for this topic. Smoking is an infringement of non-smokers' right non-smokers' right is respected. Nowadays smokers are increasing in succession. Due to the increase, smokers are increasing in crowed places such as restaurant & cafe so passive smokers will damaged 3times more than smokers. We frequently can receive on the news or newspaper about the passive smoking. For example, passive smoking is poisoned by nicotine it can also be increase the risk of cancer and in some cases, death. Passive smoking is no better than murder, like this. By the way, smoking is terrible to think in restaurants. I have many times experience passive smoking in restaurant. I feel angry when smokers are smoking and i don't think it is good. Everybody have may think the same thing like me. And there is not only smoker but also pregnant woman and kids in restaurant It are quite deadly to them. Some people say that Prohibiting of smoking in the restaurant would infringe on the smokers' freedom. But Freedom can only be ensured when it doesn't infringe other freedom. Therefore I think that Prohibiting of smoking would be rigidly enforced in public places where non-smokers' freedom should be protected.
