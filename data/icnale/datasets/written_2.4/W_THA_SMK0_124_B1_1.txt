Smoking I really do not agree with smoking because it is just not only the smell of smoking, but it also concludes the character of the person who always smokes cigarettes. I do not understand that many people ( school-boys and girls, teenagers, and adults) smoke everyday without carefulness that it is not really good for their health and the ones who surround them. Smoking is useless and terrible. Whenever it was talked about smoking there is no any useful thing to discuss at all. There are just only the bad things for smoking: - Do not be useful to any health or person: how much cigarettes you smoke, how much bad health you are. - It is not acceptable: if you are smoking at any official party, and many people will look at you as a bad manner person. - Do not practice according to some religious precepts: especially in Buddhist, the fifth precept is Do not drink any alcohol or have any drugs. These things have demonstrated why smoking cigarettes are not acceptable. There are a lot of useless things about smoking that will make you to be a bad man or woman. Therefore; all these reasons about are enough to ban smoking at restaurants in the country completely or anywhere. Thus; everyone should avoid smoking cigarettes because it is not good for health and anyone. Moreover; you should advise your friends, parents, and anyone that you know to avoid to smoke cigarettes.
