I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants for a number of reasons. First, such activity causes non-smokers to involuntarily acquire health problems and may trigger them, especially those with asthma. Of course, restaurants have enclosed areas in the restaurants that are specifically for smokers, but there is a high chance that the ventilation systems of such restaurants may account for the exposure of non-smokers to second hand-smoke. Second, it defeats the purpose of non-smokers to go to such restaurants because it affects the appetite of non-smoking customers. The scent of smoke, or tobacco for that matter, accounts for their loss of appetite. This is also a disadvantage for the restaurant management, since this affects their overall sales. Finally, the fact that smoking is allowed in restaurants encourages the fact that people can smoke in public places. In the Philippines, the act of smoking in public is already considered against the law and yet people continue to do such an act. I believe that it is the responsibility of the private sector and the government sector to take action and to inform and discourage smokers in engaging in smoking. Smoking is a dangerous act that not only detrimental to the health of the consumer and those around him/her, but it is also a habit that is lavish and does not yield anything good to our society.
