I personally agree with the statement that college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for this opinion. The one is about the experience of working, the other is about having fun in out of college. First, all the college students are in the between of student and worker. They need to be grow up more to fit into the society and situation a lot. So it is like preparation for them to have experiences of working during their college time. Next, the college is a place such as students learn and absorb a lot of things there and they even start to get to know many people and organization in other places. This is very good thing for them to make friends or meet many opinion which are different from the things they thought in college. Part-time job is one of those places that give them opportunity to meet many people and they also yarn money from that. As I am student in college, I think these two reasons are important things at this moment. Opening new world is always exciting but at the same time we are worry many things. Some people think it is very hard to start new things besides their college study. We are now in between of opening new world and part-time job is as one of them to get use to it.
