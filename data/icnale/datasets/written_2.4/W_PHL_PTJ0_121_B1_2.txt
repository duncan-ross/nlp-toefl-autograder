Working while studying A number of students are engaging in to part time jobs. Mostly the reasons are for financial assistance but there are other reasons why students work while studying. There should not be a problem when it comes to working of students. Students are working to be able to support their studies for their parents are unable to give them all the necessary requirements they need in school. Some students who work just want the feeling of independence that they can have their own money. Reasons of students why they work may vary, but students are still students. They are supposed to be studying only and not working. It should be the parents ' obligations to provide all the needed things by students as they study. On the other hand students have the obligation to give their parents grades that are acquired from hard-work and honesty but situations like these happen inevitably. Working while studying affect the students focus because they will need to do two different things. Instead of focusing only to studying and giving all their attention to it, students will divide their time to studying and working. Part-time jobs do not require the students ' entire day or week however part time jobs can also be tiring and stressful. Though majority of these jobs provide only low salaries, students still grab opportunities where they work part time and be able to help themselves support their studies. As long as students can manage to divide their time properly between work and studies, there should not be a problem. If the government cannot provide all the students scholarships, at least create a law that can protect and help working students. Different universities should also give working students the freedom to choose schedules that will not conflict on their work.
