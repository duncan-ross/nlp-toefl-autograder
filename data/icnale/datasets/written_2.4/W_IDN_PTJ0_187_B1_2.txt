College students are those who study in college. Generally, they still depend on their parents for their living. But, not all of them like that way of living. Some of them want to earn money by themselves. That is because modern lifestyle nowadays requires quite some amount of money. And sometimes, the money their parents send is not enough. On the other way, there are some college students who want to live independently, so they do not have to depend on their parents, like, forever. So they try to earn money by themselves. Some college students want to experience how to work in the future, when they graduated from college. One of the ways is to do a part time job. A part time job does not require too much time, but they still can earn some money to buy their needs and get the experience of working with other people, so they can get some training too. They can learn how to manage their time more appropriately, because they have to do their assignments and study for tests too. The other benefit is they can learn how to manage their own money. If they spend it wisely, they will have more money at the end, and they can have their own savings. That is why a part time job is important for college students.
