 As college students, we have a lot of spare time after classes. So some students tend to do some part-time jobs which both have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, it is not necessary for every student to do part-time jobs in his spare time. Just as what I have said, a proper part-time job can benefit a college student a lot. First, it is a good opportunity for college students to learn more about the society. So after their graduation, when they come into the society for the first time, they won't feel nervous or upset. Second, we can learn a lot of specific skills which is useful for us to find a good job after graduation. What's more, doing a part-time job means that we can earn money by ourselves. We are adults. We can make a living by our own hands. Obviously, to a man who is ambitious and can control himself well, a part-time job benefits a lot. However, a part-job can also have bad effects on our studies. Take a friend of mine as an example. After a few weeks' study in the college, he thought the college life is easy and free which meant he could do something more challenging. Then, he found a part-time job. It really occupied a large part of his time. At first, he was so interested in it. Little by little, he felt tired and wanted to give it up. He became impatient and spent less time on his study. At the final-term examination, he failed to pass the math test which means he would have to study it again in grade two. So in my opinion, we should be more careful when we decide to get a part-time job. If we can arrange our time well, a part-time job is no doubt a way to improve ourselves. If not, we should think it over when we do the final decision.
