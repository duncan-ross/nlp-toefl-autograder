Too many people, smoking is cool. There is a certain aesthetic appeal of smoking and wisps of smoke that waft around the smoker. Many tobacco commercials, although there are not played on public television anymore in the United States, were very sexy and interesting to watch. I think that there is a lot of sex appeal to smoking, but more than that, I think there is a lot of money in the tobacco industry so there is no incentive for the tobacco companies to do anything that would harm their profits. If the government passed legislation that banned smoking at restaurants in Japan, the Japanese tobacco companies would probably be very upset and may even have some sort of countermeasure ready in case this event transpired. Nevertheless, I do think it is a very serious problem that the country allows smoking in public places because it is very harmful to the health of everyone around the smoker. Finally, cigarette smoke smells very bad and seems to permeate the homes and the clothing of smokers, which makes it unpleasant to be around them even when they are not smoking. In all, I think that smoking will hang around for a little bit longer, but it is necessary to ban it at public places like restaurants.
