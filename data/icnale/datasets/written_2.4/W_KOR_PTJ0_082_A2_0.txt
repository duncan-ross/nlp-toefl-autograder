I can't agree to this statement. Of course, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But, it is necessary that they study for their life. Actually, some college students always are working a part-time job. By the way, it is dangerous for college students to concentrate on working a part-time job. Because, they are busy working for part-time and they can't studying. At the moment, student must remain learn and study hard. As college students, but, If they don't study hard, they will always regret and glooming. Finally, they will stop studying and leave college. At the same time, work and study is very difficult and college students will know it very tired to reach a decision. However, college student's duty is learning and studying and having a part-time job is only one in many options. Actually, most of college students don't know what they want. Dream is precious and has the future even if you fail. Perhaps, studying is very important for their dreams and Someday their dreams will come true. In the end, having a part-time job is important and good experience, but not as expensive as schoolwork. So, I think that college students had better study.
