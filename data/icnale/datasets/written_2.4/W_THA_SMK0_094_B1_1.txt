I think it should be banned smoking at all the restaurants. Because the other people that do not smoke when they stay near the smoker that smoking will contain twice the tar and nicotine when they inhale the smoke from cigarette and it will make the annoy from the smell. If you enjoy eating the perfect meals and then have a smoker smoking near your table and you inhale the smoke with the badly smell you will concentrate with the smell that will annoy you to have enjoy eating and the smoke will harm your health when you inhale the smoke you will take the twice of tar and nicotine that is the cause of many illness. The people that do not smoke and inhale the smoke from the cigarette were the secondary smoke. The secondary smoke will take more risk that is cause of the heart disease, cancer and the other illness if they inhale the all of smoke from the smoker that near the secondary smoke. For my opinion I agree with should be banned smoking at all the restaurants from the many reason that can annoy you when you stay near the smoker and inhale the smoke and take the bad smell from the smoke.
