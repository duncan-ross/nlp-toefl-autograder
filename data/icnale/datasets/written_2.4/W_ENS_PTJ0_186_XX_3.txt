It's not important! Period! The amount of work that students have to do to graduate is more than enough to keep them busy during their time at college. If they are concerned about jobs, then they shouldn't be at college. The purpose of going to college is to graduate and seek a lucrative position in the workforce not about having to worry about whether they are running late for class because they had to work an extra shift or worry about losing their job if they are a few minutes late. Students go to college to get a degree so why not stick to that plan instead of adding more stress and less study times to their schedules. Sure, some students will have to work because they need the cash to survive and that's fine because they have to do it. If they don't have to do it, then why do it? I've heard the arguments for and against and I believe that they will have plenty of time for working, after they graduate. For now, concentrate on one thing and do it well like getting high scores or being in the top ten percent which employers and recruiters are on the lookout for anyway.
