In Thailand, there are many smokers who are still smoke in the restaurants. Smoking in the public may kill not only smokers but also people sitting next to the smokers. Nowadays, the majority of Thai people would like to have dinner at the restaurants but the smokers are allowed to smoke in the restaurants. The most people would like to eat food without smoking because it is very bad smell for the most people who have not smoke. In addition to baby, they do not like smoking smell because it will cause their health. They will die soon unlike adults who have immunity more than children. Due to smoking problem, I want to tell the governments who establish policy of smoking but it could not work. This is especially for Thai governments trying to warn smokers that they should not smoke in public area. I think, Thai governments should concentrate on the policy of smoking right now. Moreover, there are non-smokers who are caused by smoking in the public area. If the Thai governments do not care about this smoking problem, Thai people will get lung cancer. On the other hand, people having dinner in the restaurant should not smoke right now because it will make many non-smokers to die.
