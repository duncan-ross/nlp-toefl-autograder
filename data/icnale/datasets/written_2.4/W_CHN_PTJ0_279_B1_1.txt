It is not rare to see college students taking part-time jobs nowadays. Obviously, as the independence of college students becomes more and more important, part-time job are turning essential. So despite its certain drawbacks and defects, I do strongly agree that college student should have a part-time job. My reasons will be discussed further in the following paragraphs. First of all, from a personal and psychological perspective, it is widely acknowledged that doing part-time jobs will do help to the development of college students. College experience is undoubtedly a treasure of our whole life, but beside academic achievement, we should also pursue the developments of our social ability. Taken one of my own experience for instance. Although I am just a freshman in college, I got a part-time job as a tutor last semester. While working as a tutor of a high school student, I realized that teaching some one also means being responsible for him. It is not the income but the experience itself that drove me along the way. Through this part-time job, I sensed that my communicating skill and the ability to manage my schedule has reached a high standard. So it is important for us college students to have a part-time job. It might also be noted that getting a part-time job is more economic for college students. When we entered university, it does not only another period of education but also means that we are grown-ups who should at least, be partially independent on economy. Since we still have to perfect our knowledge our skills that will be useful in the future, it is quite impossible for us to get a full time job. Due to what mentioned, I think part-time job is a suitable choice. In a word, although doing part-time jobs will take up students' time, its advantages on further development and economic independence can not be neglected. So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
