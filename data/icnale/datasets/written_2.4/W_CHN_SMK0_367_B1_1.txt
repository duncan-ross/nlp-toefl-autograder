Today, smoking is a widely spread habit among all the people. A few years ago, only adults smoke. But now, not only adults but also teenagers smoke. And people start smoking in more and more places. But many people are tired of this. So should smoking be banned? The answer is yes. For example, if you smoke in restaurant, you will pollute the air. Others will inbreathe the polluted air and it is harmful to their health. And the polluted air will also do harm to you. And smoking will produce a bad smell. It will make others dislike you. It will also harm to the restaurant. And smoking in other public places should also be banned. If you smoke in an Internet bar, the smell will be attached to everything in the bar. Breathing will be difficult in the bar. The next to come will feel bad when surfing the Internet. The lungs of everyone will be damaged by the smell. The most important thing is that the air will be polluted and it will influence the health of everyone. As you know, when you smoke, it will be more harmful to others who breathe in the smell. In my opinion, people should give up smoking. Smoking is harmful to not only the people but also the environment. Giving up smoking is equal to taking care of others and the environment.
