In the past few years, the news we always saw and the argument we could hear was that whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, some people agree with it and some people disagree with it. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First of all, smoking at restaurants will affect other people. As the restaurant is a big indoor shop, and it usually opens the air-conditioners, there will not have any wind going through the place so if one person is smoking, the smoke will stay at the same place for a long period, and may blow around the restaurant, other people who are staying in the restaurant will be also affected by smoke, if there are also some children, pregnant woman or people who have disease of respiratory system, the smoke are harmful to them. Second, restaurant is a place for people to eat food but not smoke. When we go to restaurant, our tasks are to buy food to satisfy our stomach and so we will stay at restaurant for a period of time. During the time period, we may talk to each other, reading newspaper, or doing other things. If there are people smoking at restaurant, it will also affect other people and make others breath the smoke, it will make people unhappy and so they will eat the food as fast as possible and leave the restaurant, it will make people do not want to go in to eat food and affect the income of the restaurant. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and it will benefit both the restaurants' owners and people who don't like smoking.
