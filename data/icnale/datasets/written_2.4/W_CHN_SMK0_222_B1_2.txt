 As we all know smoking is hurt to our health. However, many people can not stop smoking, so some countries ban smoking in public places. But Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country ? I think the answer to it is yes. Because smoking maybe lead a health problem, smokers should not smoke in public places. If they do it in a restaurant, they may hurt others. Maybe smokers thinks they are just smoking at their own places, so it is not serious. But in facts they make a secondhand smoking to others, which has immediate harmful effects on a person's heart-and-lung system. To some degree, smoking in public places is a irresponsible behavior. So smoking should be completely banned. Last year, more than twenty of the fifty American states completely ban smoking in public places. In the year and a half before the ban, hospitals had three hundred ninety-nine admissions for heart attacks. In a similar period starting eighteen months after the ban, the number was two hundred thirty-seven. That was a decrease of forty-one percent. The example can show us completely banning smoking is something necessary. So completely banned at all the restaurants is a right act.
