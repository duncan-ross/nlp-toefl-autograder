Smoking in restraints should be banned completely in Japan. There are three reasons why I think so. First, it's for people who don't smoke. The smoke from the top of the cigarettes is more harmful than that which goes into smoker. So, No matter how careful people make minds not to smoke, the risk of cancer doesn't decrease. Why do we have to suffer from the risk? I can't understand. Secondly, it's for people who manage the restraints. The smoke from cigarettes contains factors which cause troubles in the restraints. The white wall turns brown gradually and the color of the wall makes the restraint's impression bad. Managers have to pay money to change wallpaper. The smoke also damages machines like air conditioner or air cleaner. The damaged filter in the machine is no longer available. Thirdly, the most important reason, it's for people who smoke heavily. As you can see, smokers should stop smoking and some people try to do it. But it is so difficult once he/she start to smoke. So we have to support them to make society comfortable for the people who want to stop smoking. As the activity, it's necessary to ban smoking and stop smoker thinking I want to smoke.
