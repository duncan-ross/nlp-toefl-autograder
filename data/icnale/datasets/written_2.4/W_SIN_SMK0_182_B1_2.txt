I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants for the very fundamental argument that smoking involuntarily affects third parties (non smokers) and that third parties should not be forced to accept these negative health effects in a venue like a restaurant. It is important to draw a clear distinction before we delve deeper into the said argument. We are not advocating a ban on smoking completely --- but a ban of smoking at all restaurants. This is a distinction that should be always kept in mind for detractors who advocate smoking. The purpose of a restaurant, arguably, is for consumption of food, and by extension, one may argue, deriving additional benefits on top of food, for instance, time spent with friends and family at a restaurant. That said, it is ludicrous for a smoker, to start lighting up his cigarette just because he "needs' it and affect other diners, especially non smokers. We do not even need to analysis the negative effects of smoking to make my argument valid. By smoking at a restaurant, it is indirectly imposing an obligation to the diners to be passive smokers. To further illustrate my point, I will use the example of talking and shouting loudly at a restaurant. Similar to smoking, it violates the "fundamental" purpose of being at a restaurant and by shouting loudly, it is causing a disturbance (in terms of noise level) to other diners. Like smoking, it imposes an obligation for other diners to tolerate this noise in the midst of a meal and family bonding time.
