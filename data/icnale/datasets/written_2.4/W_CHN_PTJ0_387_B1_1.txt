We must put our study in the first place, then we can have some activities, jobs or joys in the spare time. Moreover, stepping society brings us lots of bad habits. We fix an eye on the materials, However, every coin has two sides. Part-time jobs bring us lots of opportunities, plenty of convenience and amounts of abilities if we deal with them well. Many students who have no part-time working experience can't adapt to the society. We also get some basic skills and whenever we are we have advantages.

We can't expect what is on the way but to try bravely and wisely on out best.
