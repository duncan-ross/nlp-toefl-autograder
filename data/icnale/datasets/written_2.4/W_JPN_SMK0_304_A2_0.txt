I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking occur health damage to not only people who want to smoke but also people who never want to smoke in life. To prevent the thing, guests are separated in the restaurant. But it is not also perfect. For instance, don't you feel smoky at the separated area from smokers in the restaurant? Moreover, it is certain that we pass the smoking area for some inevitable reasons. For instance, toilet is near the smoke area. These are just evidences that preventing health damage is not perfect. Second, smoking may lose the quality of dishes. This is because smoking make our tongue numbed temporary, we lose our taste. This is why I won't be able to taste food's real taste. This is bad not for only smoker but also chef. Because smoking also lose appetite so smoker cant' enjoy dishes fully, but almost all chef want guest to delight eat chef's cook. If we smoke, these things don't be filled. Because of two things that I wrote, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
