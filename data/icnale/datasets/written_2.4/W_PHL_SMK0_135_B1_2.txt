Smoking in restaurants should be strictly prohibited because other customers might lose their apetites and leave and they could also complain about that situation of them inhaling the stinky cigarette smoke, i have read before that second hand smoking, the ones who directly inhale the cigarette smoke; is much more dangerous that smoking itself because second smokers directly inhale the chemical filled smoke from cigarettes and has bigger chances of the second hand smoker to be prone to diseases. In some restaurants smoking inside is allow and the other non-smokers tend to complain about the smell of the cigarettes smoke and this causes the restaurants to lose some customers because of the smoker complaints. In some restaurants smoking is banned because the place is aircondition and the fire alarms might turn on but in other open restaurants and fastfood chain there are specific spots for smokers to smoke while they eat. In some restaurants (restobar) they let smokers smoke anywhere they want because they also sell cigarettes so it would increase their income and they even provide ash trays. Today some restaurants does not allow smoking inside the vicinity. I therefore conclude that new restaurant managements strictly prohibit and discourage smoking.
