Today, in many countries, it is widely accepted that college students are engaged in some kind of paid work. Therefore, many college students find part-time jobs which they are interested in. However, as for this phenomenon, opinions vary from person to person. Some people are in favor of the idea that they consider it as valuable work experience and important for learning and taking responsibility. Also it can help the college students understand the world. They will know how difficult to own money and why we need to save money in our daily lives. When they face the hardship during the working time, maybe there is nobody is willing to help you, you only overcome it by yourself. It will help the college students to be brave. Some people are opposed of the idea that they think college students are so young that they cannot work without the help of their parents. What is more, crime rates have been on the rise over the years, it is not safe that college students work outside. From my perspective, it is not necessarily sensible for college student's work. The college students need to study. If they work, they will have little time to review what they have learnt in schools. I do not agree with college student's work outside.
