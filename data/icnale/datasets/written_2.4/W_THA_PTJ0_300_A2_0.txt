It is important for college student to have a part-time job. I agree Because college students' a part time job 'Sometimes they must have a part- time jobs because someone's parents give them money which is not enough for pay each day. So that thay must have a part-time jobs. Most a part-time jobs are jobs service in stores, mall. For example Seven-Eleven, S&P, KFC, Swensens, McDonalds ect. which everyone must do duty such as check stock, is cashier, delivery, reception ect. college students' a part time job recognize the patience, discipline, and allocate Some people do after school. Until midnight. 1, 2, or may be beaten gain experience of work Before the other students that are not part-time jobs and earn more persons. May be hours or weeks in any of my comments. I provide all students with part-time to alleviate the financial burden of parents. It also has experience of working. To practice self-responsibility. The students work part time is a good delivery that allows students who have free time. Use free time to benefit. But the study is important as well. I should not leave school because of work a part-time occupation that can not be taken as a primary occupation or we should have to study hard. To get good grades. Will have a good job.
