 With the growth of willingness to gain more knowledge and experience, students, usually college students, choose to do part time jobs. There can be considerable benefits, which will show significance in the future. However, the importance depends on how the job is and whether the student can really handle it. Part-time jobs are supposed to be beneficial and be related to where the student majors. If not, it should at least help promoting student's skill of communication, self-management and thinking ability. Part-time jobs which only mean low salary and no promotion are not as important as the students' study, isn't it? To students who lives in a hard live and need financial support to his or her study, a part-time job can be appealing. To others, just make your own choice. Whether the student can keep the balance of study and part-time jobs is far more fatal to his life. Part-time job is important. However, compared with study, part-time job is just an aid part, not a key one. There are countless students who succeed in their career without an experience of part-time job, not high scores. To those who cannot even handle their study, I don't think it necessary to do a part-time job. As we can see, the importance of doing a part-time job depends on many facts, and differs to everyone.
