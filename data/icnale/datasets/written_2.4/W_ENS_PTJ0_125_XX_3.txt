University in many countries is considered a place to unwind. It represents the time between legal adulthood and the beginning of a long working life, full of stress and difficulty. Therefore, what better time to cut loose than college, where all that matters is going to lectures and occasionally taking tests or writing papers? Why else would respectable establishments such as the Princeton Review publish lists of the top party schools in the United States? The logic behind these questions lead directly to the conclusion that it is nearly imperative that college students hold a part-time job for at least six months of college, if not for its entirety. Much as university admission officers evaluate extracurricular activities as an important part of a prospective student's application, HR personnel also evaluate job applicants based on their drive and commitment outside of the lecture hall. Working a part-time job consistently through college gives an applicant a measured edge over others without such experience who may well have spent their time drinking and partying instead of being productive. Having a part-time job also teaches time management skills and gives a student more room to breathe financially. This kind of responsibility developed over time makes for a happy hiring official. It is important to note however that there are other ways of impressing HR personnel, including internships, leadership in university organizations, and volunteer work. However, a part-time job builds both your resume and your income, and should be considered an essential part of a university education.
