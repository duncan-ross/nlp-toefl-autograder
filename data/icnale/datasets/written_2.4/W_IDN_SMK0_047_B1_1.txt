According to my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 70% men in this country is smoking and cannot release themselves from cigarettes. So if the restaurants rise the rules for banned smoking many people will disagree with that. I am not a smoker but all my friends is a smoker I fell the effect if my friends smoke beside me. I got a headache every my friends smoke. People like me called by a passive smoker and people like my friends is a active smoker. One time when I go to the restaurant with my friends my friends cannot smoke on the inside of the restaurant. But after eat my friends still smoke outside the restaurants. So the rules is not working on my friends because my friends still smoke with rules or without rules. So the conclusion is if the government make rules for smoking in any public places many people in Indonesia can still smoke. For example if one man cannot smoke inside the restaurants he can smoke in outside. Because the rules just for the inside not outside. And one thing important to remember for all people, smoke is bad for our health.
