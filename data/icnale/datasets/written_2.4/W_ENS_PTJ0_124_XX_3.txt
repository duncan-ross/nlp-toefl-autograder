I agree. Having a part-time job is an important experience for college students which will give them valuable skills and help prepare them for entering the workforce after graduation. First, students seeking part-time employment will get acquainted with the process of gaining employment: finding job openings, filling out a job application, and interviewing. Looking for work usually involves searching online, scanning classified ads in a newspaper, asking friends and relatives, or visiting businesses directly and asking if they are hiring. If the student is interested, he or she needs to fill out a job application and arrange an interview. Interviewing for a job is an important skill as it's a necessary step for every job they will apply for later in their lives. At the job interview the applicant should try to make a good impression. He or she needs to look professional, be courteous, and answer questions in a thoughtful and positive manner. Second, if students are hired they will need to deal with the responsibilities (and stress) that goes along with a job: learning new skills, performing job duties, getting along with their boss and co-workers, interacting with customers, and coordinating their work and study schedules. Juggling part-time work and school can also teach students valuable time management skills. Lastly, students can acquire job skills and earn money. Most jobs will involve the chance to get some training and learn some news skills, whether it's waiting on customers at a restaurant, handling money as a cashier, or selling shoes in a department store. Any money earned can be used towards paying rent, bills, tuition, or for savings. In conclusion, it's clear that college students with part-time jobs learn important skills and will be better prepared for the job market after graduation.
