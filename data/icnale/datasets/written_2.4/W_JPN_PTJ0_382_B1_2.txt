I think it is important to have a part-time job when you are college student. We have to study hard in college but we also have to get to know how to make money. Some people says having part-time jobs take a lot of time to study but I think we can do both of them. And I think if we have part-time jobs we can get chances to learn many things which we cannot learn if we just study in college. And we can make many friends in another field. Such friends give us a lot of information, advice or interesting stories. That helps us a lot, for example, when we at a loss in our life or when we can't find our dream they can solve them. In my case I have two part time jobs. I work at restraint. It tells me that how to make delicious foods and how to speak to the people who come to the restraint. And I teach two elementary school students. It tells me that how to take care of children. These two jobs show me special things which I can't find if I just study in college. So I agree that having a part time job is important.
