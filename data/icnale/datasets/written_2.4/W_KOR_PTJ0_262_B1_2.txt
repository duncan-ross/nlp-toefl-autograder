We all are living in a competitive world. The modern society requires us to be more experienced, more talented, and more professional. As stated in Darwin's theory of natural selection, the survival of the fittest still applies to our lives, no matter of our age or gender. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job at any time of their academic career, if they can, in order for them to experience as many things as possible. A part-time job allows one to be exposed to the environment of a real workplace. Students working as a cashier of a tiny bookstore or a waitress of a fancy restaurant have more knowledge about the working system in the bigger picture than students who are only regular customers. For instance, they can become familiar with the hierarchical structure of the workplace, manufacture and transportation of the goods and services, and most importantly, the value of earning money -- along with economic concepts, independence. Part-time jobs let college students learn many aspects of a working person, as mature adults. Moreover, people who work as students will be more prepared when any abrupt situations come up. One never knows how his or her life will turn out to be. It is always better to have experienced something previously because the chances of making the same mistake next time are slimmer and one can plan ahead for the next step. Besides, part-time jobs can provide valuable friendships; the people you meet as a college student part-time worker may be a great help in the future. In conclusion, the experience and social connections together are the best advantages that a student can get from part-time job. Learning a new thing is always a good thing. As young adults, college students should be encouraged to take any available part-time job opportunities, so that they will be more prepared for the competitive real society.
