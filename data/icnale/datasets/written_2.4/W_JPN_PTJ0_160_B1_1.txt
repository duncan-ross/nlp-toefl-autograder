I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Now I am a tutor and I have learned a lot of things. First, it is difficult to work a job not to skip it. For example, if I have a cold, I can't skip it. In case my students have a cold, they could take a rest perhaps. Second, it is also difficult to teach my students. I teach two students now. One of them is 11 years old girl and the other is 17 years old boy. At first I thought it is easier to teach primary-school student than high-school student. In fact, it is more difficult for me to teach her because she is childish. The other student, high-school student, listens to my lesson carefully. So we can communicate with each other but she can't do it. Finally, I learned to know my personality very well. If I didn't do a part-time job, I couldn't notice my weak points. Since I learned these points, I will change right. If I didn't have a part-time job, my opinion might be different by chance. But I really learned many things and maybe these experiences will be a great help to me. Therefore I think it is important for college students to have a pat-time job.
