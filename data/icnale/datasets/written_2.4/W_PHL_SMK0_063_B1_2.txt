Smoking is bad to our health; it may contain some kind of drugs like Nicotine. Before I don't know why do people smokes but now I already know that smokers do smoke because they found a sense of pleasure on smoking. Smoking can lead to a lung cancer and the worst is death, so if you're a smoker be conscious of your life. There are many reasons why smoking should be banned in restaurants in the country but I can only give you the few general reasons. But first I mind that it would be better if smoking should be banned in all public places not only in the restaurants. The first reasons that came out of my mind is that because most of the restaurants are public place where all ages of people can be found. If you smoke in the restaurant the smoke will spread on the air and the people who are also in the restaurants that don't smoke maybe irritated to the one who is smoking because they are affected that they can also inhale the smoke coming from the cigarette. Also smoking in the restaurants can cause an accident like fire. For instance, the gas tank of the restaurant is open and it mixes with the heat of the smoke it can cause an explosion in the restaurants and it will took many lives. If that accident happens, the one who are smoking should be the one to be blame of even though he unintentionally wants that to happen.
