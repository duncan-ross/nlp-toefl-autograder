I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is really bad to our health. Though someone said that the smell is good, it still bad to our bodies. Think about it, if we just smell it everyday, not smoke in person, and will be terrible sick maybe sixty years old, maybe get cancer and all you could do is just stay in bed or in the hospital everyday with a lot of money that normal family cannot pay, and cannot eat normally, don't we have to seriously look at this thing? Even the one who smoke everyday. Besides, I think restaurant is a place to relax and be comfortable with other or yourselves. Think about this, when we are funny with something but have to recognize our life, then will be felling bad. So, if someone understood it but really cannot stop it and insist to smoke, then please think more about other people just follow the rule and find a proved place to smoke. And there will not have people to stop you, and can smoke comfortable. Doesn't it be better? So, think about yourselves even the other people, I think it is better completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
