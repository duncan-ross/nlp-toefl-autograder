Some people who are smoking might hastily say that smoking is right for their happy. Because they think smoking can relieve their stress. However I am convinced that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because the restaurants is public places, which coexist smokers and nonsmokers. First of all, you can have second-hand smoking, which is big health hazard. In Korea, the smokers had smoked in nearly everywhere including restaurants, shops and home where their children were growing up. For example, I remember who are died by lung cancer. He is a healthy man who never has been smoke. But he works on the restaurants for long time, which have lots of smokers. So it is harmful smoking at the restaurants. Later, this smoking at the restaurants will make young people are more likely to become addicted to cigarettes. Secondly, other customers might be annoyed by the smell. The smell of smoking is felt sick. But, the smokers cannot catch it. For example, there are people who are talking at the restaurants. Some smokers clean their mouth. However the smell is not easily fade away. Few minutes later, nonsmokers can smells with their nose. So they cannot focus on talking. In this respect, if smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, it seems to be wise decision for all people. In conclusion, for the above reasons, I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
