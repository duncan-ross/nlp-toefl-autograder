Experience is the best teacher A quote I always hear from the elders. Students usually think of having their own income. Isn't it so evident that we go to college so we will have our own source of income in the future? In our school, we often thought of it too. I agree on students having a part time job. Having a job is a hard task. You should be responsible enough in order to do it. Mind setting is also important. If you only think of just the money you will get then it is not worth it. College student who have part time jobs should be the successful professionals someday, I suppose. It's because they already know how it like is to work for your own. Like the quote said, experience teaches you. Even on how you control your money. As early as college time, you should already have a part time job, a job not only for the sake of money but for the learning also. So it will not be so hard for you to adjust after you graduated. It's like your training grounds for the future. So this I must say, I agree on us, students, having part time job. Even organizational job is included. You should be busy always, go out on your comfort zone and learn from it. Experience will teach you anyway.
