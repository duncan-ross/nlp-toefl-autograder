I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons. Firstly, almost college students will become a working member of society. I think we can get the skill which we can't get by only study by having a part-time job. I have a part-time job now, and my boss said, 'you will get the skill which you can hit the mark which stops, but you will get the skill which you can hit the mark which moves by having a part-time job.' In short, I believe that we can get the skill which we need after becoming a working member of society by having a part-time job when we are college students. Secondly, we can find how difficult we earn money and how much trouble we have given my parents. I can't have ever thought seriously that the trouble my parents have seen, but I could find a little how much trouble my parents earned money and raised me. With it, I really felt thanks for my parents. I believe that I wouldn't think it now without having a part- time job. In conclusion, college students can experience many things by having a part-time job. Therefore, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
