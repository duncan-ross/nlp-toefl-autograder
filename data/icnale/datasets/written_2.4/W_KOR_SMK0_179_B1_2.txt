I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all of the restaurants because of following reasons: Banning smoking at all of the restaurants cannot stop people smoking at the public place which has more serious problems; the owner of the restaurant might have difficulties when customer smokes at the restaurant. Firstly, smoking at the restaurant shouldn't be banned because if smoking at the restaurant is banned, they would smoke the outside of the restaurant which has serious problems such as indirect harm toward people who don't smoke as much as smoking inside of the restaurant. Therefore it's no use banning smoking at all of the restaurants. The other reason for being disagree with the idea that smoking at the restaurant should be banned is that the owner of the restaurant would encounter difficulties if the customer smokes at the restaurant. Even if smoking at the restaurant is banned, some people might smoke at the restaurant. This situation would make the owner as well as other customers uncomfortable and persuading not to smoke would be difficult to the owner. Therefore it would be not beneficial to ban smoking for the owner of the restaurant. To conclude, I completely disagree with people who claim that smoking at all the restaurant should be banned due to Banning smoking at all of the restaurant cannot stop people smoking at the public place which has more serious problems; The owner of the restaurant might have difficulties when customer smoke at the restaurant. Some people would disagree with my opinion because smoking at the restaurant is harmful for people's health. It could be. But it would be better if the restaurants make sections for non-smoke people and for smoking people instead of banning. Therefore smoking at the restaurant shouldn't be banned.
