In the past part-time job was not popular in Thailand. Many people thought that only poor people that have to do part-time job for money. But in the present, everything were change. Part-time job is getting popular today. Many students want to get part-time job for money. Some want to work for experience. The last vacation my friends worked in one restaurant. They work for experience, friendship and a little money. They wanted me to do it too but I can't go to work with them because I have to work for my family business. For me I think part-time job is interesting but I don't want to do it. I want to do the best for my study. I think part-time job will use a lot of time. I want to use that time for my extra studies and read more books and many free time activities. If I use my free time for part-time job, I think my grade will be worse than do not have job. Only study in my faculty is too hard and very tired. Everyone must read a lot and remember all of the knowledge that we had learnt. So I had no time for part-time job.
