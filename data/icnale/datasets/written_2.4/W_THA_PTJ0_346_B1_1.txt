In my opinion, the past-time job is very important for college students. First of all if we have a past-time job we will deduct a lot of money from my parents. Also, if we have we're mommy we are can pay some thing for we are family, we are parents and I. Secondly, if we have a past-time job we will spend the free times for the past-time job, that if we don't have a past-time job. Maybe we will spend the free times for the thing it bad for example we will spend the time for the internet all day all time, will spend the free times for the TV and Radio. Maybe, we me be use the duct and gambling. One reason that if we have a past-time job we're will have experience in that job and we are want to be flow to make that job in the future if you want. The last one if you can make money by your self you will feel so good and fell proud not with you but with your parents too. As you can see the past-time job is very important for college students and it can make you many feel many experience, So we should have a past-time job.
