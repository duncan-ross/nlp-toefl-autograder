There is no one-off answer to that statement, it all depends on what the individual seeks in life. Like a part-time job, being a college student is just another tool for the student to better or improve him or herself. If the student weighs the part-time job more than the educational degree attained at the end, the student might as well disrupt his or her studies or even terminate it. This trend is getting more and more common nowadays, especially so given the increasing abundance of degree holders entering the job market each year around the world. Having a degree does not mean as much compared to yesteryears. That said, most traditional-minded students will still prefer to finish their education and possess a piece of educational certificate before settling for a safe job, which is completely plausible given that most employers still assess based on educational credentials. There are not much opportunities other than an education that proves possession of ability and knowledge. We live in an IT savvy world now, and more individuals are finding it lucrative to make it big based on opportunity creations from it. I personally have friends who have disrupted their illustrious education in prestigious courses/schools, and ventured into online businesses. Some are even contemplating giving up their education altogether. These decisions were clearly made after meticulous considerations, such as a steady income source as well as personal development. In conclusion, college students have a bright future ahead of them, and that does not necessarily warrant a degree. It rather depends more on the individual's interests which will determine his or her success in the chosen field.
