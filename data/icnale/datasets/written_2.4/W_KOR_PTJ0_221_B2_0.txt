I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I have three reasons for this. First reason is that college, especially in Korea, is where students start to learn to be independent. In my perspective one of the biggest problems for Korean students is that they are too much dependent on their parents. Of course, in Korea until high school students are expected to only focus on their studies so not many Korean students work and depend on their parents. However, this needs to change and being independent economically is a first big step which can be done through having a part-time job. Second reason is through part-time job students can earn hands-on social experience. College is a step right before starting social life and when students graduate college they start taking part in the real world with lots of responsibilities. This can be also experienced through part-time job. For example if a person works in a restaurant, there is a manager, waiter, cook and there is a hierarchy among the members and by working there a direct experience working under the social hierarchy system can be earned. Last is by having part-time job you can meet lots of people in different fields and might find out your specialties. There are millions and millions of people out in the working and by having part-time job in various areas students can meet these people and learn from them. Also, I believe changing part-time job once in a while is helpful because you can try and work in different fields and might find your future job. For these reasons, if part- time job is done in an extent where it doesn't affect the studies it is an important part of college life.
