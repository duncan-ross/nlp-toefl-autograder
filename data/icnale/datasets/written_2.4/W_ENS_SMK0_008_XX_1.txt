I don't know anything about Japan, but I do think it is a good thing for restaurants to prohibit smoking in their interiors. This is due to the simple fact that smoking is terribly unhealthy and by smoking in a small area or inside a restaurant you are effectively making everyone around you smoke as well. Everyone already knows that smoking gives you cancer and everyone also knows that secondhand smoke is much more dangerous than first hand smoke. The toxins contained in second hand smoke are especially dangerous for young children and so at the very least family restaurants should ban smoking. I think it is okay for bars and clubs to allow smoking indoors even though it does make the place known very dirty and it makes the air very heavy and hard to breathe. However, these kinds of places are for adults, and adults should be able to do what they want to do. Adults are also much more resilient to the effects of secondhand smoke and so they can afford to spend more time around it. Also, smoking is a great way to socialize and meet new friends and although I do not smoke myself, most of my friends too often bring this up as a primary reason for doing so.
