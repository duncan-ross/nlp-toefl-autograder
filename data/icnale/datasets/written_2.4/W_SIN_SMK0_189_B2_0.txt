To me, I feel that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in the country. By banning smoking in all restaurants, it will be too restrictive on smokers who habitually smoke. This is unjust because they should be given the freedom to do what they choose to and not be bounded by rules. Restaurants should already have designated areas where smokers can smoke. This is sufficient as I think that these measures will provide all restaurant patrons a comfortable environment and ambience to dine in. However, it might be useful to ban restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for the smoker's health as well as passive smokers. As a non-smoker, I feel bothered by the smoke that I inhale. This is especially harmful for young children and the elderly because of the health risks involved such as lung cancer. In addition, this ban may cause some smokers to gradually stop smoking and stop their unhealthy habit. Also, the smell of smoke may hinder with the ambience of the restaurant especially if it interferes with the dining experience. Personally, I choose to dine at indoor restaurants with air-conditioning if possible, so as to avoid any smokers dining close by.
