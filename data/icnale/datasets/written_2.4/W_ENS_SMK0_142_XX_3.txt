I don't agree because it comes down to a civil liberties case, I think. It should be left up to the marketplace to decide and not put in the hands of the government. Since restaurants are usually a free enterprise entity, then they will know soon enough what the majority of their customers' want, when they see their cash flow statements at the end of each month. The smart operators will go with the money as they say and adapt their policies to suit their client's wishes. Others will simply go out of business by trying to be all things to everybody which is an impossible way to run a business and almost guarantees that they will fail. Once the pros and cons have been weighed up by both restaurant owners and patrons, they will more than likely resolve the smoking/non-smoking issue themselves, without government interference. By allowing free enterprise to go with what the market dictates, governments would be following the wishes of the majority of citizens anyway. People are under the illusion that governments rule countries when in fact, it is and always has been, the marketplace that dictates policy. Most governments will then just blindly adhere to whatever the polls infer or ups and downs in the marketplace, which also includes restaurants.
