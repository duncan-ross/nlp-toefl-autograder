I don't think that college students need to have a part-time job because our main responsibility is to study and get good grades. Please understand that many of us are already so busy with that demands of a modern college education that we simply do not have time to waste on part-time work especially if it is not related to our major or our future career. But the point of going to college is that so you can get a good career, and anything you do which would detract from that goal would be simply stupid. That being said, most of my friends who've already found a part-time job, and many of them think it is a good idea. Many of them tell me that they have made a lot of new friends through their part-time job, and I can say that I think that that is a bad thing. However, I wonder how having a part-time job has affected the studying habits of these friends. I hope that they are not finding themselves so busy with their part-time job that they no longer can have enough time to do their homework well and have some time to relax to.
