Now many college students want to have a part-time job. But is it important for them to do a part-time job? Some people may think it is vital for them to know more about the society. However, in my opinion, I don't agree with this. I think it is not quite important. Firstly, the reason that so many students want to do the part-time job may be is just that they want to make money by themselves and have more experience. They may work in some fast food restaurant. And the pay is not very high. The part-time job can occupy a lot of their time. So it is not good for their study. Some jobs may ask them to work at night and it is harmful to their health. Secondly, as a college student, the major of the duties is to learn the knowledge. Actually, most of the college students have no special ability or techniques, so their jobs mostly are likely to be waiters or something else that can't help them to improve their professional skills. Thirdly, because the jobs are not close to their professional knowledge and the jobs are somewhat tired and the payis low, they maybe lose heart. In fact, a lot of universities have provided students with many chances to take part in practice. The practice not only won't occupy a lot of time, but also give students enough experience. In short, if one has a lot of free time, he or she can do a part-time job. But it is not important or necessary for college students to do it.
