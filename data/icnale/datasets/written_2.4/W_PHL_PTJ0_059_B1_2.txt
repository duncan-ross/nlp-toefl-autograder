For me, the importance of having a part time job in college depends on the status of the person. As we all know, the status of the people in our world are not equal. There are people who are rich and there are also people who are poor. If the family of the students have enough income and resources to support their needs don't anymore need to have a part time job in college. Since having a part time job in college would just serve as an additional burden for them. Plus it is already no point for them to have a part time job since they are already enjoying their lives. In the case of the poor students who can't afford the expenses in college, whether they like it or not, they have to have a part time job if they still want to continue studying in college. Since studying college is very much expensive aside from tuition fees, there are also transportation fees, allowance, miscellaneous fees and others. Even though it is difficult and time-consuming, part time jobs can give them extra-income to support their expenses in college. Sometimes the wages of part time jobs are low but it would help them reduce the burden of their families especially, their parents.
