I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I feel that while it is not important for students to have a part-time job, having one is beneficial. The main aim a college student has is to study well. He should cherish the opportunity given to him to gain new knowledge and spend the precious few years learning as much as he can before entering the workforce. Having a part-time job will drain the student of his time and energy which may affect his studies at school. The student may not have enough time to study for exams due to his work schedule. Worse, he may be too tired from work to be able to concentrate in school. In addition, work related problems may affect his concentration in school. These problems, as a result of having a part-time job, will affect the student's performance in school which defeats the aim of having an education. On the other hand, a part-time job may be beneficial to the student. Having one allows him to know the hardships of earning money and appreciate the care given to us by our parents. This may teach him to spend money wisely and treasure the roof over our heads, the food we have and the extra comfort items we can afford to buy.
