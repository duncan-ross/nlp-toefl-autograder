College is a place where students enjoy and do other activities freely. A job is very difficult to maintain for the people. A student who do part time job they are in difficulties and they also study instead of jobs. Due to some reason students do jobs because their family cannot afford their college dues. Some students also do jobs because they cannot depend on their family. But when they do jobs may divert their attention towards studies. They cannot study well because they have burden of job also. They cannot do both things at a time. Because they not too much time to do both work completely but for their family and college dues they have to work. Both are necessary for them. College gives the m education and jobs give them money, if they have no education they cannot do job and if they no money they have no money they cannot get education. Some family founds the students to earn and do jobs. They required spending the whole day for earning money. This leaving phase makes us to do jobs and to get education. Government should do something for these students. They should pay dues for the student who cannot afford they have to study. They are very intelligent and they can make the progress of the country but they have not enough to for studies.
