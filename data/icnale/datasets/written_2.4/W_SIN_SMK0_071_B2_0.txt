I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, of the citizens in the country, not all are non-smokers; smokers do mingle in the midst of the people. Even if the non-smokers belong to the majority of the citizens, the minority should not be ignored or neglected. Laws should not be of a majoritarian model but take into consideration of the minority as well. Furthermore, a compromise can be made between the smokers and non-smokers when smoking corners are created and the non-smokers can sit at the non-smokers area to avoid the second hand smoke emitting from the puff of the cigarette. Just as it would not be fair to the non-smokers to make all areas smoking areas, it would similarly be unfair to the smokers to ban smoking completely in the restaurants. Additionally, if an outright ban is conducted, the wrath of the smokers may be incurred. Subsequent public outbursts and unhappiness may follow if a total ban is conducted, unless the government is able to provide a convincing reasoning for the move. However, since smoking has always been socially acceptable, an example being how cigarettes are openly sold in convenience stores, it may be hard to convince people otherwise of a culture they are used to. While smoking may be discouraged, it is not completely frowned upon. Therefore, there may be a high resistance against the placement of a ban of smoking. may be discouraged, it is not completely frowned upon.
