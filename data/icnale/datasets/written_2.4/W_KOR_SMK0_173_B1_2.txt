I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Most of the restaurants have smoking zones. Smokers go there and eat or drink. We don't have right to prevent their right that smoking. Instead of banning smoking at the restaurants, we have to make a rule that smokers and non-smokers can agree. I think if smokers do not realize smoking zone and smoke everywhere and then it causes bad effect, they should receive penalty. Of course, smoking is bad, but spitting on the pavement is the worst. Smokers in Korea spit phlegm on the pavement after smoking. It drives me crazy. It sounds dirty and looks weird. I think smokers don't realize that it looks and sounds dirty, and it's not care for other people. Thus, we should have rules for people who smoke and spit phlegm on the pavement. I heard that schools try to teach that, but it is not good, so we have to make institute for smokers and how it feels and property of it. I think unconditionally, banning smoking causes bad effect, we have to make rules to handle nation fairly, so we should listen to opinions of both.
