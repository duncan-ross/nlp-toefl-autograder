 Nowadays, with the rise of the emphasis put on people's health, more and more people choose to stop smoking. But there are still a large number of smokers. Then there comes to a question about whether it should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As to this choice, people who smoke must have a different opinion with those who hate smoking. From my point of view, I can't approve the proposal of banning smoking completely at all restaurants all over the country. Absolutely, it's not easy for us to understand what this proposal aims at. And we also understand this way to solve the question. But in fact, this way is not fair to those who have become heavy smokers. Though I have no experience of smoking, I know it's really hard to give up smoking once we are addicted to it. So once this proposal is carried out, it will bring sizable inconvenience to many families. On the other hand, we have to admit smoking does harm to people's health seriously. In terms of many researches, smoking has been the cause for many serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Maybe some smokers don't care the bad aftereffect it imposes to your body, but you should have cared others. When one smoke, the smoke from his cigarettes will make people living or working with him suffer from it just as themselves were smoking. So the smokers can't be allowed to smoke at their pleasure in the public, especially restaurants where many people gather. So it's not proper to carry out this proposal thoroughly, while it's also improper to allow smoking to a degree. I think the most wise measure business operators should take is to set up special parts for smokes isolated from other customers. I believe this may be a way which has the least harm to either.
