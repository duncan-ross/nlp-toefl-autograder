Nowadays, it is increasingly popular for a college student to make a part time job in their spare time. From my point of view, I'm quite in favor of this kind of practice. My reasons are as follows. In the first place, we college student are adults. We have the responsibility to support ourselves financially. We are no longer children taking it for granted that parents should pay for whatever we ask for. We should get what we want by ourselves, or at least, partially. Parents won't support us financially for good, so why not make an attempt to make money independently. In the second place, to make a part time job also contribute to our process of maturity. Compared with the campus, the workplace is much closer to the society. The society will surely teach us what the campus can't. Since it is often said that the campus is a society in miniature, so where else can we learn more than in the fierce, dignified society? In the third place, to make a part time job can make us have a better understanding of the essence of making a living. We should bear in mind that money is never made easily and that it is really difficult for our parents to support a family. Since we became adults, it is no longer necessarily for them to keep supporting us financially, they just do this spontaneously. We should be grateful. All in all, to have a part time is highly desirable for college student. I hope all the college students can have a try. Should we even fail, we wouldn't lose anything.
