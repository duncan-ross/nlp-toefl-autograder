I agree the issue. The smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. Eat food is a nice thing; it is make us relax, happy and satisfied. Sometimes, eat just for take a break to go to next works, if somebody smoking around you, and you are not a smoking, the feel is not good. The smoking is not a good hobby. Smoking is not good for health and the smoking have to deference to other people in the restaurant. Smoking person make me uncomfortable. Smoking is not good for our health; maybe it is make he feel good for minutes, but smoking to take a change for the health, and make people uncomfortable can not enjoy their food in the restaurant. The smoking can result in the lung cancer. If you smoking a lot and you obtain the lung cancer probability to be very high and not your family, friends but also people around you, either. The smoking can not enjoy the food in the restaurant. Smoking destructions sense of taste. If you smoking, people maybe don't like chat with you, because you are Smelly. In conclusion, the smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. And maybe people have interpersonal relationship.
