Everyone knows how bad smoking is. We always see the campaign about anti-smoking in many ways for example poster, advertisement, banner etc. especially, "do not smoke sign" in the restaurants. Many people usually smoke in the restaurant maybe they think it's a relax place that they can do something like that. For me, I've ever sat in a restaurant with a smoker. He smoked all time and blew out toxic smoke into the air. It was very smelly. My hair got smelled. I felt very angry but didn't know how to do with him. The smoker should obey "do not smoke sign" which pasted on the wall. It might have an important reason to paste it. Like in the restaurant, where people enjoy their delicious meal and charming atmosphere, how do you feel if you are eating delicious Tom Yam Goong and someone blows out the toxic smoke past your face? Nobody feels happy about that, I think. So, the smokers please obey the sign and do not make other people feel bad with your behavior! I think it's the right way that smoking should be banned not only at all restaurants but also public places like hospital, park, temple etc. because many people get sick by breathing the smoke from cigarette and nobody want someone to destroy the nice atmosphere by smoking around there. Out of this, the cigarettes are the main cause of cancer too. Today is not too late for you to stop smoking. It's not only good for other people but it also good for you!
