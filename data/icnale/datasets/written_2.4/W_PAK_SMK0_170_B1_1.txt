In the whole world, smoking is a great problem of pollution. So I think smoking should be banned in public place. Especially in restaurants it should be banned. Because if you imagine that you are sitting in a expensive restaurant and unable to enjoy the meal due to the cloud of smoke coming from a neighbors table. It is very uncomfortable for non smokers and for your family. If your family members include grand father, grand mother, your parents etc. your family inhaling the cloud of cigarette can be very dangerous. It is bad enough that automobiles, processing plants, and other types of industries which pollute our environment. So in all restaurants, non smokers have a right to clean air as they can enjoy their meal. In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants. Because restaurant is a public place. In a restaurant smoking create a bad impact on children. Because in restaurants many children are fascinated by the act of smoking. After seeing that they try to use it, which may later develop into a habit. Smoking is also a great cause of health diseases, both for smokers and non smokers. Because it is filled with tobacco. There is nicotine in its smoke. Also a cause of a number of cancers and heart problems. For example lung cancer, heart attack etc. So a ban on smoking in all public places would greatly decrease the health diseases. Frankly I believe smoking is complete wastage of time and money. Smokers just look stupid. They are criticized and judged daily by strangers just for having a cigarette in their mouth. So I agree with it that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.
