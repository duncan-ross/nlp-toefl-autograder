I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, there are many kinds of job. One of them is a part-time job. For example the part-time job are work at restaurant, café, industries, etc. Sometimes the worker are college students. They work after they finish their study at campus or before they goes to campus. The purpose from college students to have a part-time job are they want to get money for what they want, or they want to help their parents. Some say they want to spend their free time, or they need to add a lot of friends if they want, and they need to have experience on the world of job. Part-time job also have negative effect. There are, they can feel so tired, this condition also make they can't to do their assignment well because they also must to do their work. On the world of job they must to learn about communication with other people. They can learn how to give a great respond. And they can learn the others when they can't get on the college. Because if they just learn on the college, they can't to growth about the world or world of job.
