Smoking is a habit that never ceases to amaze me. With all its evident harms that it harbors, millions around the world continue to smoke, and millions other are joining in as well. I am fine with their actions, as this is a decision purely made by them. However the advent of second hand smoke and being a passive smoke irks me, thus the thought of having smoking banned in all restaurants truly is a wonderful suggestion. First, we observe the percentage of population who would be affected by this new ruling; evidently the non-smokers would outnumber the smokers. This means that more would stand to gain from the benefits of having smoke free environments created, where our lungs are relived from the sufferings brought upon by carcinogens. Second, having smoke free restaurants enhances the eating experience for diners throughout. Non-smokers would be able to enjoy their meals in peace, without having to hold their breaths when a nearby patron is puffing away. Lastly, we are doing the smokers a favor by making it harder for them to find areas to smoke. This may create a knock on effect where some smokers may be turned off by the difficulty to find a spot that they can smoke legally and hopefully quit smoking altogether. Smoking is no doubt a social vice that we do not need to accommodate with in the future, and banning it in all restaurants is the essential first step towards that brighter, smoke-free future.
