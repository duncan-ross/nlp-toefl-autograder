I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some may assert that a total ban of smoking is not necessary. However, permitting smoking in a place where food are served might compromise food hygiene might have a substantial adverse health impact. It could be argued restaurants that have outdoor seats do not need to be banned. These restaurants could direct customers who smoke to these outdoor seats where there is a better air ventilation as compared to the indoors. Furthermore, setting aside a special zone of seats for smokers could keep a certain distance between the smokers and non-smokers and thus reduce the chances of second-hand smoking. Thus, a complete ban seems to be unnecessary. However, restaurants are places where food are served and thus a certain level of hygiene standards have to be met to ensure customers do not fall sick after consuming their food. If smoking is allowed in restaurants, puffs of smoke particles could be carried by the wind across tables and could even land on the cooked meals. Hence, these puffs of smoke particles would have sabotaged the hygiene of the cooked food. Moreover, children and others, whose respiratory system are more sensitive, could be part of the mealtime crowd in the restaurant. If smoking is allowed in restaurants, they could cause unnecessary health issues for the vulnerable. As a result, a complete ban is actually a protection for these people who essentially want to have a proper meal without having to cough uncontrollably. Also, during mealtimes, crowd gather in the restaurant and thus any potential health risks due to second-hand smoking could be substantial. Hence, a complete ban is one solution to eliminate such a risk. With the concern of food hygiene and potential of substantial negative health implications, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
