Every man has its own perspective view regarding to smoking. According to me it should be banned in all public places and in all restaurants. Because the restaurants are those places where the people comes and take relaxation and enjoys drinking eatings and smoking and etc. But smoking is very bad habit and has very dangerous effects on human health. But there is the thing that should smoking be banned in restaurants? I think it depends on the owner's of restaurants. Either they permit it or not. But one thing should be in our mind that numbering of flint areas of smokers are increasing day by day. Number of smokers have been increased. In 2005 there were 27. 6 percent smokers, and in 2007 there were 31. 1 percent but yet there are 71 percent. According to scientists say that it should be banned. Now there are some main reasons due to which smoking should be banned. One thing is that restaurants are the public places. Where the different kinds of people and families comes with their childrens for enjoyments. And at the same time there are some smokers and non smokers also there. When the smokers smoke then the non smokers are exposed to do the same. Which is very bad thing. Passive smokers are exposed to smoking. This also a big reason that's why smoking should be banned in restaurants. Families comes there with childrens and childrens are exposed to do the same. This is also a reason. All the restaurants will stuffy due to smoke. There will be no fresh air in restaurants, which is very harmful for human life. Then the people will suffered in different kinds of heart diseases. Protect the non smokers from smokers. Non smokers can suffer in different kinds of disease like nausea, due to the absence of fresh air in restaurant. That's why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Due to all these things smoking should be banned in all restaurants.
