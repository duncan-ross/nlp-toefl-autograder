In the past few years, I've gone through a few part time jobs. I've been through the buy and sell business, the stocks industry and even the supermarket area. And In all of these jobs that I have underwent, I can conclude one fact: that it is necessary for college students to have a certain amount of experience in working. First of all, part time jobs serve as practice and preparation for the future job of a person. Simple part time jobs may seem unimportant, useless even, but in the eyes of a company, all types of these is important. Next, it gives experience to the college student. After college, people usually find jobs. And in those job interviews, there is always going to be that one question: "How much experience do you have?" As a requirement in future job interviews, one must have a certain amount of job experience for them to get hired. Thus, having part time jobs gives college students the opportunity to see the way adults work, and experience the hardships and problems they go through. Lastly, it gives college students the opportunity to learn. Learning in this case wouldn't simply be learning how to do a certain task, but also learning as an individual. Having part time jobs not only helps college students in their resume, it also helps them grow as people. No matter how little a person works, they always learn that there is room for improving themselves as individuals. Overall, we can say that it is important for college students to find part time jobs because it helps them learn, gives them experience and helps them prepare for the real world in the future.
