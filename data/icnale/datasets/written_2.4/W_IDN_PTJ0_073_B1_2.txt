Part time job is an activity that we can do while we are having a free time. Many university students and students do part time job. Everyone has different perception about part time job. But, there is one main reason why people like to have part time job, that's for getting salary, experiences, and actualize ourself. In my opinion, part time job for university students is not too bad. In this case, they should get experiences before working when they graduate then. As we know that experience is the most precious thing in our whole life. Every university students have to think how they can apply their knowledges from college in working world then. They must think about their visions too. Because of that, I think part time job is a good way for students who want to get many experiences in working. They can fill in their free time with part time job, rather than do negative things that can ruin their studies in school or university. Beside those, they can get money by themselves. They can use that money for paying college duties. In the other hand, they can be more appreciate money. Because many university students can feel how difficult for people to get money. So, I really agree with part time job for students or university students, also they have to maintain and keep their studies well.
