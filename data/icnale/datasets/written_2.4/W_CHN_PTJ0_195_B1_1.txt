Recently, there is a phenomenon that many college students take part-time jobs in their spare time. In accordance with such a phenomenon, a constant debate has been arisen. Anyway, I agree with the idea that it is good to do a part-time job. However, it is unfair to say which is better than the other if we do not see both sides of the story in the following paragraphs. Some people believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. On the one hand, by taking a part-time job, students can acquire a lot of valuable experience, which will enhance their ability in future. On the other hand, students can learn how to get along well with each other and know society better and deeper. However, other people stand on a very different ground. They hold the view that it is harm to do a part-time job. To begin with, when the students do a part-time job, the study will be neglected. Meanwhile, society is complicated, the majority of students cannot protect themselves, and a lot of parents worry about their children will be cheated. From my perspective, I believe that if time permits, college students should do a part-time job. After all, to take a part-time job provides the students with a valuable opportunity to put what he has learned form books into practice, which will have a profound effect on their future job markets.
