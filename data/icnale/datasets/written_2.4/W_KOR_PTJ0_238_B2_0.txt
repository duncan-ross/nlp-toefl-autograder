It is not as much important for college students to have a part-time job as students and adults think these days. Basically, college students entered college to study more deeply what they were interested in. So, they should be more concerned with study, not a part-time job. Of course, it is important to have various experiences when young. However, volunteering or internship can give enough experiences to students. I think it will be more valuable experience when they don't earn money. They should not be interrupted study by money problems. Society need to help student to be given scholarship or study without concern about money problems. Also, it should give students various opportunities, such as volunteering, internship or counseling for what they want to be or where they want to work in. Furthermore, college students' having part-time jobs can make problems about justifying irregular workers. Many students don't get enough money from their working place because society think college students are not adults yet, like adolescents. I don't want to say that students should not have a part-time job. In conclusion, society has to give student more opportunities and boundaries, and it is desirable that students concentrate on study first, not a part-time job.
