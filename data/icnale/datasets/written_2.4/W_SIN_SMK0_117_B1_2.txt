The rationale to prohibit smoking at restaurants is based on the argument that smoking is not only harmful to the individual who engages in it, but affects the people around him as well. Allowing smoking in restaurants would promote an activity that may cause irritation to other patrons. Smoking in a restaurant would interfere with people's enjoyment of their food. Also, the pungent smell and the dusty air that results from smoking within an enclosed space is not something that non-smokers look forward to. In addition, restaurants are places for family, friends and loved ones to get together and have a relaxing time over a meal. People who go to a restaurant do so in hope of a good meal in a serene, relaxed environment; and to allow smoking in restaurants spoils the mood and atmosphere for this, and would deny many non-smoking patrons such a luxury. While some smokers may argue that their rights are being neglected, I believe that restaurants are not the place for them to exercise their right to smoke. Smokers can exercise this right in many other locations; and should they feel the urge to smoke while eating in a restaurant, they should be encouraged to fulfill this need outside, where other patrons will not be disturbed. Restaurants, as an eating place that should cater to all patrons, should be kept clean and smoking, therefore, should be completely banned at all restaurants.
