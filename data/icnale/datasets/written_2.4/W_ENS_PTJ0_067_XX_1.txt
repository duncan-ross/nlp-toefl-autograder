Working part time in college is very important for many college students, I think. I think this because I have worked part time since I came to college, and it has given me a variety of good things. For example, I have been able to make a little bit of money for the weekends and other times. I can also use this money to help pay for my text books which my parents do not want to pay for. Next, I have been able to become smarter by working at my current part-time job. I have learned how to manage and maintain a computer system through my internship, and this is valuable experience that I could definitely use to help me find a real time job. This is just what I would like to be doing when I graduate, so unlike some students who work their part-time jobs at restaurants or other places, I am definitely not wasting my time. The one bad thing, however, is that as expected, I do sometimes have some problems balancing my school and work life. Really the biggest problem is that you meet new people at work and you can develop a new social circle there as well, and it is hard to have two main activities that you need to be doing (school and work) as well as two social circles which need your attention.
