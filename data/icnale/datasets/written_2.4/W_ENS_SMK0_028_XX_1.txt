Banning smoking at restaurants is becoming a common practice in many states in the United States of America. The fact that smoking is still permitted at Japanese restaurants would thus appear to be a temporary condition, because as time goes on the limitations on smoking are becoming more and more widespread. In addition, no one likes to have their meal ruined by an inconsiderate individual who deems it appropriate to light up right in the middle of the restaurant. Such an individual is endangering not only himself but also others around him with his second hand smoke, which is surprisingly much more dangerous than the smoke he will be inhaling himself. Long periods of exposure to secondhand smoke have been known to cause cancer just as long periods of smoking does as well. With this kind of obvious link between a life threatening disease and a stupid habit, the choice to quit smoking and the choice to ban smoking at restaurants would seem to be obviously a good one. Nonetheless, there are many individuals who consider themselves rebels and find all kinds of ways to claim that other people are imposing upon their rights to be themselves. There is no way to please this kind of individual, but there is a way to keep this kind of individual from hurting other people. That would be by banning smoking at the restaurants in Japan.
