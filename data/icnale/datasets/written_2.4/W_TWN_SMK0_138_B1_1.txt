I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Recently the entire world starts to find the problem of smoking. Smoking has a lot of disadvantage, such as, making your lungs worst and worst, your mouth smell bad and the worst of all is when you are smoking you will hurt yourself and people around you at the same time! In addition, once you get into the habit of smoking, you will spend a lot of time to quit this habit and finally you may feel it too difficult so give up quickly! To stop smoking continue being a threat to people, completely banned it at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. As everybody know smoking has threat our health many years, and we should improve this problem as soon as possible! Many reports have proved that people who get lungs cancer more than a half is that they have a family get into the habit of smoking. It means that many people are cursed by people smoking around them. So, in order to improve this problem, I think the first step is to use the law to ban these people smoking in the public place. Although this way can't help people quit smoking, it can help many people who hate the smell and protect our health at least.
