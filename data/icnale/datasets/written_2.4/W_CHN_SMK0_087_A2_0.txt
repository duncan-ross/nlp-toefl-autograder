It has been proven innumerable times that smoking do harm our health. There exist many smokers in the society at present. Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves, but also brings many trouble to others. Smoking in public places even can make others smoking. There are millions of Chinese people dying from smoking each year. The number of people dying from smoking is far more than that of drinking each year globally. Smoking is harmful to many organs of human being. Smoking often will bring about lots of disease, and shorten our life. As far as I can see, smoking should be completely banned in public places (such as restaurants, classroom and so on) in our country. The city will be more harmonious and more beautiful than ever. Of course, it is a habit hard to give up for those long-time smokers. So some special places which is for smoking must be built in the restaurant. There exists a long history for smoking. We must keep our respect to those smokers who should have a free right to choice. One day, when there is no smoking in the restaurants, in the buses, and so on, we will be happier in our life.
