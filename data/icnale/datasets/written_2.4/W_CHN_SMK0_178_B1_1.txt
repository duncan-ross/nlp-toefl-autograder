I agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have the following reasons to support my view. Nowadays, some governments have completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. This is a good idea for people don't smoke though it is unfair to smokers. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment by giving poisonous gas off into the air. When people smoke in the restaurants, of course, the air in the restaurants will be polluted by the cigarette smoke. Other people will feel very uncomfortable to eat there. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters' working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants cannot bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. Smokers think it is unfair for them but smokers can smoke outside of the restaurants when they really want to smoke in the restaurants. So from all the disadvantages of smoking and good points of banning smoking in the restaurant, we should ban it from now on in the restaurants.
