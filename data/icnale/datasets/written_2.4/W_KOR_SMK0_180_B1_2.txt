I absolutely agree with a prohibition of smoking in all the restaurants. It's the fact that has been already proved smoking affects all the people around smokers. Even though the fact is it, Korea doesn't have suitable law. I watched a programmer about smoking in public area. Once, a baby who was passing under the balcony was damaged his eyes by ash. It means smoking in public area is very dangerous and harmful for anyone around them. It's obvious smoking cause cancer people who don't smoke, near the smokers. When I was in Ireland for 8 months, I saw many Irish smoking. But it was outside. Even in the pubs, they didn't smoke because it was a law. I was so impressed that feel need to have a law in Korea as well. It's not forcing smokers to stop smoking. They need to avoid smoking in public area. We can make some area or place outside the restaurants for smokers. I think it should be banned not just in all the restaurants, in all the public area because the opinion you mentioned does not completely force them to stop it. So, the opinion I mentioned is not so strong law when we consider the danger of its harm.
