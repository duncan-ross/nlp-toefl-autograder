It is of utmost importance for college students to hold part time jobs since it is advantageous for both the student and their family in various aspects. The student would be able to pick up precious values and skills like tolerance, patience, responsibility, working in a team, reaching to compromises etc and hence, gain experiences that are outside of the classroom. Other than picking up valuable skills, students would be able to experience the hardships of trying to earn an income of their own, rather than relying on their parents for monthly expenses. Also, they could use a portion of their earnings to fund their college fees and their daily expenses so as to reduce their parents' financial burden as well. Additionally, students are able to pick up prior work experience if they do not have much exposure in the job market. They would learn and understand the skills of the trade and would be capable of applying them in their future careers. Trying to juggle both college (which includes academics and extra-curricular activities) and a part time job isn't an easy feat as it requires extensive and careful management of one's own schedule. Thus, by attempting to balance one's work and academics, the student could prepare himself for the demands of his future career when he balances his full time job and social life.
