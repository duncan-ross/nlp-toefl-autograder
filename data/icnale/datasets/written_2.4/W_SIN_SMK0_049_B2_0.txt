Smoking has been a socially acceptable habit for the longest time. And yet personally, I do not think that society has got this one right. Not only is smoking accompanied by a string of health-related issues that one does not realize usually until he or she turns 40, it stains your teeth and fingernails yellow. There is also a conception among youths that smoking is tied to one's "cool" factor among peers, and that one cigarette in your hand somehow gives you an extra edge to your personality. Personally, I have never heard of greater hokum than that, but I cannot deny the fact that there are a sizeable group of teenagers out there who think that personality and charisma are a result of the cigarette packets in their pockets. We can never understand the brilliance of teenagers can we? However, I must admit that scientific evidence, as it currently stands, are at loggerheads as to whether the effects of smoking are truly hazardous as the media claims. Perhaps one reason the media in almost every country in the world, including Singapore, has sought to prevent the advertisement of cigarettes, is that of a health policy reason by the government. For example, the population in Singapore cannot afford to fall ill due to copious amounts of smoking, and become a burden unto society. Moreover, the importance of a healthy workforce, which is inextricably tied to a productive workforce, could have been an especially crucial consideration among parliamentarians in Singapore when they debated about the general stance against smoking.
