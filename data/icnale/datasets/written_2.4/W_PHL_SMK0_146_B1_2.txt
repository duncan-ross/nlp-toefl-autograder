Smoking must be banned in restaurant because smoking in restaurant can lose the appetite of people in the cause of the air quality being inhaled. Smoking can affect our health. This may lead to lung cancer, asthma, bronchitis and heart disease. It is ironic to hear that every smoker is aware with the effects of smoking but they still continue this bad habit. Once, my family and I were in a restaurant and the people sitting beside our table were smoking. There was an air-conditioner and the smoke was blown to us. We don't mind it, we just covered our nose but the other people sitting next to us were very angry. We heard that he told his son: Smoking is very disgusting. It may burn your lungs and I don't want to see you smoking when you grow up. After a while, they didn't even order something and they walked out from the restaurant. See how smoking can turn down and lose customers from a restaurant? Even to us, we want to walk away from the restaurant but we already ordered our food before those smokers arrived. We were just to try a new restaurant that time. If we just knew that they'll arrive, we might not eat in that restaurant.
