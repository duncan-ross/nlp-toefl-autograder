Some people don't realize the dangerous of smoking for health. They just enjoy their cigarette and don't care about other people. There are so many smokers in this country and they smoking everywhere, not only inside their house, but also outside the house, even in public places such as restaurants. Absolutely in restaurants, smoking should be banned. But in a public place outside, it is not a big problem, because you may just walk away if you do not enjoy smelling it or being around it. But when smokers smoke inside restaurant, that could disturb other people while eating. They also can contaminated with the cigar's smoke. In the opinion of scientists, people who breathe the smokes from other people are more having risks. People like this usually called passive smokers. In the restaurants, one smoker can cause many people breathe his smoke as passive smokers. That smoker can make many other people having risk for many serious diseases, such as lung cancer, impotency, etc. So smoking should banned in public places and the government must set out rules for every one not to smoke in public places including the restaurant.
