I agree that it is very important for students to have a part-time job while they are in college. This is because a part-time job is valuable preparation for the future of the student and will also help them to expand their skill set in the ever increasing demands of the modern business world. We learn in business school that a lot of students enter the workforce unprepared to meet the high expectations and required work ethic in many large corporations especially. Since I personally want to find some work in a large corporation, I think it will be necessary to have strong part time experiences, and I have thought so for a long time. Therefore, I have served at three different internships, and when I graduate at the end of this fall of 2011, I am confident in my previous experience will serve me well and I can land a really great job with really great benefits. Then, I will be able to enjoy that good position for many years to come, so my part-time job will have served its purpose perfectly. For any student like me, a part-time job is absolutely essential and is in a prudent preparation for the future.
