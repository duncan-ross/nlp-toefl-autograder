According to my personal experience, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Viewing from the social phenomenon, this can provide a smooth stage for students to get involved in social life when they graduate from the college. Significant reasons are as follows:First, we need to shape ourselves into competent men. After we step into the real social life, we must content with many people. By having a part time job may enhance our ability in competition. Second, taking a part-time job can impart the hard side of life to us; we could learn the difficulties in making a live. At the same time, we could catch up with the capacity in dominating the work and study reasonably. Last but not least. Of course, we can earn some pocket money to buy things we like and reduce some family burden. A little income may encourage us to fight for our future. Everyone is ambitious of success in life. Based on the several reasons I have addressed, there is no doubt that it is important to have part-time jobs. This can be obviously an essential element for students to get used to future life and be well prepared.
