I cannot agree more that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country for two major reasons. For the first, smokers do not have any right to disturb non-smoking people while having a meal. Once people smoke in a space, the smell prevails in the space for a long time no matter how much effort is made to remove it. The smell and smoke can reduce other people's appetite and make them feel bad while eating. It is proved that eating something in a bad mood can cause health problems. Even though smoking and non-smoking areas are separated, there is likely to be the smell of cigarette since it leaks while the door is being opened or closed. Secondly, smoking not only pollutes the air in the restaurant, but also can make the place unhygienic. Food and ingredients can absorb the smell and smoke, which is definitely not good for both taste and hygiene. Besides, ash is generated while smoking and often moves in the air. As the ash is not easy to see since it is small particles, people might not recognize the ash falls on their food. Consequently, they may come to eat the ash with the food. How horrible! Therefore, smoking should be prohibited at all cost in every restaurant.
