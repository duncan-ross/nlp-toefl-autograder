I think that a college student to have a part-time job is important. Because I can make money by myself. Besides, I can know many friends. Every holiday my friend and I can go singing at Cash-Box. After singing, we eat dinner together. Every day is a happy day. I love my friend, because people say "True friends always help each other when they are in trouble". A student to have a part-time job that can train his independent ability and thinking ability. There is no denying, a student to have a part-time job that is right. Now, many college students have a part-time job. They make money and work hard. Than, they fail their class. Because they work all night and tired, they sleep at their dormitory. When mid-exam is coming, they loss. This is so bad. We never give up our study. There are many kinds of work provide of students, such as convenience store or super market, video store, security company... etc. If you don't know how to choice part-time job, you can google at internet. You also can find 104 bank. You can choice the best of love.
