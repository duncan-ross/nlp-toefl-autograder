I agree to some extent with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is harmful to our body. Studies have shown that smoking can cause cancer. However, smoking will produce a negative externality in the form of second-hand smoke which is even more detrimental to health than that of the smoke inhaled by the smoker. Therefore, it is right to ban smoking, not only in restaurants, but in general on health and moral grounds. Other than that, some people generally dislike the smell of cigarettes. When you go into a restaurant, you are actually paying for service. This service comes not only from good food, good service from the waiters but also ambience. The smell of cigarettes would destroy the lovely environment for people who generally dislike the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, for restaurants, which I would classify as offering a service to customers, it would be fair to ban smoking. Some people might argue that people should be allowed to do what they like with their own body. This argument about the freedom of actions is slightly flawed. A diner has just as much rights to clean air as the smoker's rights to smoke. However, since they have the same rights, it is not fair to favor either side. In conclusion, a possible solution to this is to divide restaurants into two sections, one for smokers and one for non-smokers, as some restaurants in the world have done.
