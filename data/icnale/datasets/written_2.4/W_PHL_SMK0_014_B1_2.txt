Cigarette smoking is dangerous to our health. This statement is always included in the last part of the advertisements of every cigarette products in the Philippines like Marlboro, Hope, Philip and others. As for me, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in our country. However, smoking should not be limited in all restaurants in the country, the selling and using of cigarettes must be banned in the whole country to avoid its consequences. Smoking can cause different respiratory diseases like lung cancer, and tuberculosis. My father had tuberculosis because of smoking. He was confined in the hospital for a few days. At first, he quit smoking but as days passed by, he just can't resist of using it again. Our family doctor has been convincing him to stop, but he just doesn't want to do it. For my dad, smoking is his stress reliever. He uses cigarettes as his outlet for his problems. According to the World health Organization (WHO), in the Top 50 causes of death in the Philippines last 2010, Lung cancer is in the 11th place while Lung diseases is in the 8th place. In order to solve this problem, the different non-government organizations conducted campaigns against smoking in the public. As a student and one of the future leaders of our country, I am supporting the implementation of sin tax in the Philippines. This will help lessen the number of Filipinos died because of smoking.
