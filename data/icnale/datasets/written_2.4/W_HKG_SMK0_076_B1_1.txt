It is undoubted that smoking is unhealthy. In Hong Kong, there was completely banned at all indoor shop a few years ago. Initially, smokers and some shops as pub disagreed this law. Their reasons were that human has a right to smoke and smoke banning would make lots of benefits due to lose of smoker customers and so on. At the end, they are past. Restaurant is a public place for open hour and closed room, air does not flow free and will keep smoke inside. Smoking is not a personal activity and it will produce second-hand smoke which is more harmful for body than one-hand. If one smokes, another non-smoker must breathe the second-hand smoke. Therefore, in order to our health, we should ban smoking inside all restaurants. It is not only for customer, but also concern the health of worker. They are working at restaurant about ten hours per day, it is very danger for them if they always breathe the second-hand smoke. Health is most important than anything. For restaurant owner, they worry about income would be affected if smoke banning. The fact is that some did but not all, it is because smoke banning restaurant will attract more non-smoker. It is another way for compensation. At the end, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants for protect our health.
