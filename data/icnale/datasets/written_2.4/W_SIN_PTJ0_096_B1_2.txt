During my summer vacation, I worked as a retail assistant selling clothes and branded goods. It was a difficult time for me as a part timer since I had to wake up early in the morning and worked till wee hours at night. However, the pay was meager and we had to put up with a boss that could not be bothered with our welfare. The staff was generally unhappy as well due to the massive workload we had. On top of that, we were dealing with customers that belonged to a bunch of rich ladies that were impatient and could not tolerate a single glitch during their shopping experience. Overall, work as a retail assistant was disastrous but a good learning experience since it reminded that me that I should never step in the retail industry upon graduation. Therefore, it is important that college students should have a part time job before entering the work force. This is because it allows them to have an exposure on what kind of industries they are suitable for upon graduation. In addition, it adds to their learning experience in terms of giving them an idea of how the working world is like before they graduate. As a business administration student, I am interested in specializing in human resource management. Therefore, during one of my part time jobs, I worked in a human resource management department and this increased my liking for the specialization as I realized that the work scope was in line with my passion and interests. Therefore, having a part time job would be good to determine what is suitable as your own career path.
