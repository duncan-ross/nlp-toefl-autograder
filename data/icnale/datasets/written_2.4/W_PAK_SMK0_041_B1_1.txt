Smoking is an extremely bad thing to get hooked on. It not only affects the people that are smoking but also the people around them that breathe that same air. Smoking is harmful to your body and it makes you look and smell bad. Who wants to get breathed on by an ashtray or see those nasty yellow stained teeth Not Me.. . Some people say that smoking is just a bad habit and nothing more. They couldn't be more wrong. Tobacco use is an addiction. According to the U. S. Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline, "Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, " nicotine is a very addictive drug. For some people, it can be as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Some actually place it in a category 10 times more addictive than heroin. Smoking is also a very expensive habit. I was just at Wal-Mart and a carton of cigarettes is $40. Assuming a carton a week, that's $2, 080 a year. Is that insane or what? Myself I would much rather spend that money on shopping or something. You don't have to be a smoker to be seriously harmed by the fumes either. If you life with someone that smokes or maybe you just sit by someone smoking on the bus. Your lungs are going to be harmed. Second-Hand smoke is just has serious as smoking. The amount of second-hand smoke inhaled by the typical nonsmoker is equivalent to one cigarette smoked a day.
