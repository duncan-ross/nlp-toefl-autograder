There has been a dramatic increase in the number of smokers in recent years. However, smoking is gradually being forbidden in more and more public places. Restaurants, under this circumstance, become most common places for smokers. Actually, some advanced restaurants have already taken measures to prevent people from smoking while having meals. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking does harm both to the smoker himself and people in the neighborhood. It is common sense that smoking is the cause of a series of severe diseases including the lung cancer. What's more, some people around the smoker may be allergic to the smog, which can lead to the unpredictable consequences. On the contrary, if a restaurant is free of the released smog, the air around will be clear enough to enable the people inside to refresh themselves. Furthermore, banning of smoking can largely decrease the possibility of fire. As is known to us all that the kitchen in a restaurant is full of lampblack in most times, which makes it easier to catch fire than in other places. So no smoking means that the security of the people in the restaurant will be better assured. Last but not least, if only some restaurants prohibit smoking while others don't, a phenomenon will emerge that a number of smoker will chooses to eat in a small restaurant where smoking is allowed. This will cause the increasingly worse of the environment in those small restaurants. To conclude, smoking has a bad effect not only on people's health, but also on the environment. Therefore, I hold the opinion that at all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned.
