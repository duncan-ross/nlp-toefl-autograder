In the Philippines, almost one-third of the population is composed of marginalized citizens. This group of people live in the slums and they don't have sufficient income to pay off their living expenses such as food and even the education of their youth. As a result, marginalized children only had the opportunity to complete their primary education in public schools. These children don't have the chance to pursue their dreams further because there are only a few public universities or colleges in the country. That's why it is significant for these students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs offer a number of benefits to college students. On one hand, college is considered to have the priciest cost in terms of tuition fees in the country. Thus, in order to help lessen the expenses of the supporter of the student, this undergraduate should engage in part-time jobs. Even though part-time workers don't earn a lot of money, at least there's a reasonable amount that can subsidize the student's expenses such as school projects. On the other hand, part-time jobs give college students experience. Since college is supposedly the preparatory period before engaging in a profession, the experience that the students get from part-time jobs help them visualize the different workloads they might encounter after they graduate. Therefore, these students gain more knowledge hands-on. Some students might regard part-time jobs as a waste of time and a hindrance from concentrating in their studies, but in reality, part-time jobs are just what college students need in order to be prepared on the kind of labour that awaits them after they graduate.
