I agree with "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. " First, Restaurant is a place for people to enjoy, to relax and to reunion with family and friends. Restaurant is not a place for people to smoke, nor a place for innocent people to inhale bad smelling secondhand smoke that ruins the pleasant atmosphere. Why do people have to pay for something they don't like? Second, the taste of food may change due to the environment; an ice-cream in a bathroom won't be delicious as the one on the beach. Same things refer to the food in the restaurant, dishes that are covered by smoke won't be as tasty as the original one, and that is absolutely not the chef to blame. Third, According to medical references, we know that if a pregnant woman inhale secondhand smoke, it may cause serious problem to the baby inside. Secondhand smoke is also bad for the growing of teenager kids, and causes human to have respiration problems and cancer more easily. If every happy gathering turns out to be a harmful trap, what will the world be like? So in my opinion, for the good mood while eating, for the tasty of food and for the health of human, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
