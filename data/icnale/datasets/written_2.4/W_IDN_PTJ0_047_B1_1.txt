I think part time job quite important for college students. We can add some money to our pocket then we can also get much experience when do the job. Beside make some money and get some experience we can make relationship with many people. There are many kinds of part time job as I know. First, the part time job where we make own or company and second the part time job where we work on other people or company. Other than work on the other company I prefer to work by myself. Beside get much experience, if my company reach the target we can get a lot of money than we work on the other company. Part time job is very useful for me. I can pay my college cost by myself. Beside that I can buy anything that I want and also treat my friend or my girlfriend. My mom will be happy if I have part time job, she happy because beside I get much experience for myself I also can buy what I need by myself. Therefore, part time job is important for college students. That's it my opinion about part time job for college student.
