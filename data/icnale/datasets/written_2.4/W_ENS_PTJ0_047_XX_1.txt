A part-time job is a good part of becoming a successful career oriented woman. I currently have a part-time job in a local salon, and even though this part-time job is not really related to my major, I feel like I am learning good things that I can apply in the real world when I graduate and start to look for a real career. For example, I have learned how to deal with a variety of kinds of people as customers. Some people do not understand what it is like to be a customer service position, and they do not treat you very well, but you still have to be nice and smile at them and be polite. On the other hand, there are many people who have had a customer service position who understand the difficulties as well as the perks, and they are truly a pleasure to deal with because they will treat you very well and not give you a hard time. Lastly, working at a part-time job teaches you a lot about money because not only do you have to manage your own money, you can see how other people have to manage theirs as well so that they can pay for haircuts and other salon treatments.
