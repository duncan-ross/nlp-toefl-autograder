I strongly agree simply because we need to ask ourselves what is most important in this situation, human life or monetary gain. I feel that most people would agree that human life is far more important and since we only have one life, it is important that we do what we can to protect ourselves and each other, from unnecessary risks and dangers. Smoking is risky and smoking is dangerous and I feel that most reasonable people would have no problem in accepting bans on smoking in restaurants or anywhere else where smoke poses a threat to human health. I f restaurant owners were to calculate the figures correctly, they would soon understand that they wouldn't make as much profit if their customers started dying off or were to ill to dine at their restaurants. Whatever monies were lost due to an initial ban would be recoverable over a longer period of time. From a moral point of view, restaurants should not have any problem with accepting bans because of the obvious dangers smoking poses to their customers. Neither should Japan's government hesitate in introducing these bans based on the public's approval. In spite of whether the public or restaurants approve or disapprove, the bans should be put into effect.
