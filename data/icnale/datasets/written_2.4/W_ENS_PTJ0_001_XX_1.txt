It's not important at all in my view. Students have far too much to worry about just trying to pass their exams let alone also trying to hold down a job while they study. Some folks may disagree I know, but the fact still remains that in today's society, students are being taught to perform at high levels from primary school to university and/or college and quite frankly, it is a big ask. This is particularly true when students are studying for more comprehensive careers such as in medicine etc where study loads are quite heavy and competition is high. Being a student myself, I can't imagine trying to get within the top ten percent of my course and hold down a job as well, even if it is only for a few hours a week. It takes me all my time just to complete my study schedule on any given day without having to trundle off to a job at the local fast food shop. I know that several of my fellow students are in the same boat and feel the same way that I do. We have a tremendous amount of reading to do, just to try to keep up with our workload. For me to pass with high scores, I know that I couldn't possibly take on a job and still perform at a high level. On that basis, I don't believe that it is important for students to have a part-time job because I believe, for me anyway, that it is more important to focus on studies and let the jobs come later.
