Most colleges and universities offer opportunities for students to make money while working for a specific department or program on campus. Besides the financial benefit this provides to the student, it also has the extra bonus of allowing certain individuals the chance to learn additional facets of their chosen career path. Funding for student worker programs comes either from the federal government or the school itself, meaning students who get these opportunities generally have guaranteed employment through school. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on your hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management.
