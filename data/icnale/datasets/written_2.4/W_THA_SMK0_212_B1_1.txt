I agree with the statement is that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. You can image if you aren't a smoker sitting in a restaurant and next to you there is a smoker. How do you feel? Restaurants are public area, where I think that is not appropriate for smoking. Smoking at all restaurants can make bad atmosphere and cause an adverse health to non smokers in that area. First of all, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it makes bad atmosphere. Smoking nears non smokers can be considered as impolite manner in many or every countries because of its bad smell. Smoking smell can make air become bad and most of people who come to restaurants may be unsatisfied at those restaurants. It also can make the conversation in a group of non smokers stopped. In addition to smoking in restaurants should be banned because it causes a bad healthy to a group of non smokers. Smoking cigarette can cause many bad effects and cancer diseases. These adverse effects are not just impact to smokers but also non smokers who get air of smoking. Unfortunately, the non smokers may be more getting adverse effects than the smokers even they do not smoke but do inhale directly. In conclusion, smoking at restaurants should be banned in the country because it creates bad air atmosphere and cause bad effects to your health.
