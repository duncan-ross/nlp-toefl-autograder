I think this rule should be allowed now. Because, Smoking is effective for some people who are pregnant, be an allergic decease and be some decease about lung. Smoking has a lot of toxic which is bad for healthy. Nowadays, Smoking is not allowed in the nightclub and the restaurant in Thailand. But, this rule is not being effective immediately. I saw some restaurant and some nightclub allow many visitors to smoke. It was worse for someone who cannot prevent their selves from smoking. I absolutely support the government to set this rule and against someone who smoke in prohibited area. I think the government should be use the strict rule about smoking in the public area such as; bus stop, toilet and the official place which is related with the government. Many places in Thailand must have the smoking area. I saw some place doesn't have smoking area. A lot of smoker has to smoke in public area. It is not good for someone who hates smoking. Smoking interrupts everyone who is at smoking area. Although, this rule will be use in the future, it can't less some people who like to smoke to stop to smoke. Most of second smokers have been ill more than the first smokers. Smoking in restaurant should be banned now. It will save the earth and save your life. Smoking makes pollution in atmosphere too.
