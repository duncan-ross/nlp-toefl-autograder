I agree with the idea that many college students should have a part-time job, but I think it is up to the students to decide for themselves if they will have enough time to fit this into their schedule so that they can still balance their class work and socialize in order to have the best college experience possible. Many students are too busy to have a part-time job, and such a student would be well advised not to place extra stress on themselves by finding a part-time job. On the other hand, a student who has enough time to have a part-time job may enjoy the extra benefits having part-time work can bring such as developing professional contacts and expanding your network of future colleagues. Next, it would be interesting to see if there have been any studies upon how many hours they student can work before they begin to negatively affect their performance in school. I guess that somewhere around 20 hours which is the upper limit for part-time work, students would begin to feel like they have no choice but to not do some of their schoolwork so that they can complete all of their work tasks. As long as they can say under this upper limit, they can probably balance everything they need to balance, and they will be better off for learning how to do that.
