Nowadays, more and more people have an addiction to smoking. In public, it is easy to see that many people smoke without limitation. Some people think that there is no need to forbid smoking in public places. But some people take an opposite attitude on this problem. I believe that the latter is right. I insist that we should explicity forbid smoking in public places. It is true that people who are addicted to smoking may feel very uncomfortable if smoking in public is forbidden. They need to smoke in order to relieve the pressure and gain energy. But that is not to say that the former view is totally decisive. In my submission, no one can deny that banning smoking in public places will bring a lot of benefits to us. That we forbid smoking in public is absolutely necessary. Firstly, cigarette includes many poisonous things such as nicotine. When people smoke in public places, other people will be hurt by second-hand smoking which is the main reason for causing lung cancer among non-smokers. Secondly, smoking too much is also bad for the health of smokers. Banning smoking in public may help them smoke less. In addition, no smoking in public reflects the responsibility and trait. Smokers should think more about the feelings of other people. As the problem is so serious, we should take actions to solve it. Banning smoking in public is a thorough method, which can reduce the harm of smoking effectively. In conclusion, it is necessary and essential for us to forbid smoking in public places.
