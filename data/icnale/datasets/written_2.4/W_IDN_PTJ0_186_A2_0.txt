Based on my opinion in Indonesia about the importance for students to work part-time Students have to learn because their parents are still responsible but they have different reasons Part time job could become an example of experience working on a part time job for students as students are less able to increase tuition fees and help the economy of such parents in Indonesia large number of unemployed and students can understand all because students can get the experience that a lot of examples for students working part-time advantage is to seek responsibility, adds to the cost of school, set the time management, until he could learn to adults and other whereas the impact of part-time work can interfere with him in time to learn, maybe a lot of tasks and the existence of extra-curricular My solution on a part time job for students should not be used, because he has the task to finish its work as a student and concentration with a lesson without thinking about work, because if he can finish his job as a student he can perform the following tasks and concentrate on the job will be undertaken after completing his duties as a student and also students can feel how wonderful the good times as a student.
