About whether college students should have a part-time job or not, so many people so many ideas. But I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. And as far as I know, there are a great many of people also think so. That is why?For college students, they have much free time, and many students do not know how allot it. If they use it do meaningful things that are great. But if not, how pity! However, if they have a part-time job, they use the time wisely. Besides, they can also learn much experience that is very useful. For example, if you are a manager of a company, there are two graduates looking for job. The former have abundant experience while the latter have little. Which would you like to choice? There is no doubt that you will choice the former. Another reason is probably that college students should take more care about their parents and try their best to reduce their parents' pressure. After all, they have been adults and they are able to make a live themselves. For one thing, they can learn many things from having a part-time job. For another, they can help their parents. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
