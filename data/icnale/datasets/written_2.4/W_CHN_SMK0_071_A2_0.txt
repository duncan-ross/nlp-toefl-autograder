I think that smoking cannot be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. Since late 16th century, tobacco has been popular worldwide. A large quantity of people fell in love with this mysterious material. Smoking can really bring exciting feelings. So many smokers cannot live without it. That condition causes a series of problem such as lung cancer, even air pollution problems. Based on an idea that makes life healthier, some governments and professionals put forward an advice that smoking should be completely banned in the public places like restaurants. In my opinion, smoking is a very troublesome thing. But I hold the view that we cannot ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. First, many people now cannot live without cigarettes or tobacco and they want to smoke before the meal and after the meal. That is to say, they need smoking in the restaurants also. Where will they go if smoking is completely banned in all the restaurants?Secondly, in fact some countries' economy relies on the tobacco production. If smoking is banned completely in all the restaurants, tobacco production will reduce and economy will be influenced. Therefore, we can choose to only ban smoking in some restaurants for people's health or we can divide restaurants into two parts. One part is for smokers and the other part is for non-smokers. I think do it is more practical. And some day gradually, we can ban smoking completely in all the restaurants. But not now.
