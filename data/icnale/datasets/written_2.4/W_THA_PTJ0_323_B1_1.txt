In Thai society, there are many college students or even university ones doing part-time jobs because they would like to make money for their own life while they are studying. When they do it, they will have experiences and enjoy doing it because they may earn some money per day or even per hour. There are three reasons why it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First, students can promote their study through part-time jobs. For instance, if a law student finds a part-time job in a law firm; his practice will enable him to better understand what he's learned from books. What's more, the part-time job can offer him opportunities to go beyond what he's been taught in class, and he'll learn something that doesn't exist in books but in practice. Second, I agree with the college student to have a part-time job because when he does not have enough money, he can find a part-time job to do after school. He doesn't need to phone his parents, and ask them some money. When he does it, he might work with his colleagues then become friends. There are many benefits when he does it. For example, he will have some money to pay for his dormitory, food, or even course registration. Third, last but not the least, part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families. College tuition fees have greatly increased in the past ten years due to the new educational policy. Many students from poor families cannot afford college fees, and our bank system fail to loan college students as effectively as it does in developed countries, so taking part-time jobs becomes a way for them to meet their great expenses in campus lives.
