I disagree that college students must have part-time jobs. People around me have experiences about part time jobs and they think it is important to get a job or live their lives. However, I think having part time job is not good for students. I do not have much experience about that and my parents think studying hard is better. Thus, I was not interested on, but my brother was not. He got a part time job in family restaurant as soon as he entered university. He devoted his hours to clean dishes or make food. He always worries about his grade, but he can't handle it because that work makes him tired. If he doesn't have to go to school, he must go to that restaurant and work at least 8 hours. I think it is terrible. Because of that, my brother's hands have a knife wound. Of course, earning money is important, but I think reading books or enjoy their own university life is more important. I also try to enjoy my life. I think after graduating university, people have to get a job and work, so we don't have to do part time job to have experience about jobs. I hope many students in Korea enjoy their lives to see movies, read books or enjoy their hobbies instead of working.
