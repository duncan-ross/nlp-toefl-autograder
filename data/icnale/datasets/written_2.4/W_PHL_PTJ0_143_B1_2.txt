Part time job is one of the important experiences that would help develop the skills and human relation of every individual in our chose fields. these jobs are designed by some businesses, may it be a small store or a big company that really aims to educate and prepare the students in the real workplace of professionals. As a students, I am really aiming to be trained in a prestigious company who is capable of enhancing my knowledge. This will not just broaden my awareness of being a professional but will also give me a chance to apply my own ways to the advantage and welfare of the company. Therefore, part time jobs must not be one sided only. You as the part timer and the one who will give you that chance to learn must know your respective objectives. Part timers are there to learn and be trained for grater chances on getting jobs immediately after graduation thus you should contribute positively on that company. Companies that offer these opportunities to students like us have their own objectives too. They are ther to obtain our new ideas on doing things that can also be of help to them. However, it is not easy to embrace this experience since you must weigh your time if you can do it. The decision to have this job is hard because you might sacrifice some aspects of your life. However, not all students have the same perception as I have. Maybe some of them don't find part time jobs significant. The only thing that we need to remember is the impotance of being prepared in every stage of life and to be flexible for the changes that we will be dealing with.
