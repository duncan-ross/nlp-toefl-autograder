Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? These day, many public place ban the smoking. This policy may be good for the nonsmoker. But in case of smoker, it may be inconvenient and unfair situation. However, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And there are two reasons for that. Smoking is harmful for nonsmokers too. So nonsmokers can be damaged their health although they do not smoke. It is very serious problem for nonsmoker. And if smoker smoke near at nonsmoker and then nonsmoker feel one's heartbeat faster or have cough suddenly, it is responsible for the smoker that. And many nonsmokers don't like the smell of the cigarette. So especially at restaurant, the smell of the cigarette can make people's appetite diminished. And it is bad manner of the public place. Therefore smokers should consider the nonsmoker at the public station like the restaurants. Smoking can make nonsmoker unpleasant and harm the nonsomker's health. So although smoker feels some inconvenience for the policy, they should avoid smoking at all the restaurants.
