Nowadays money is one of factors that is important to daily life. So many people want to do part - time jobs. For college students, I think it does not need to work a part - time job. Because you must study hard and have many homeworks to do. It make you could not study effectively because you will be tried from working. If you have the problem about money you should ask your teacher for advices. You would be sufficiency and don't waste the money to useless things. I think having a part-time is not good for college student. some people do a part- time job and also get money from your parent. They don't tell them about the work they do. Some people do a part - time job for money to buy the waste things such as mobile phone, travelling and drinking. When you are tried from working you will not pay attention in class. And you also feel asleep because you do not have enough time for sleeping. Then it is problem of studying in class. You can not divide the time to study and the time to sleeping. Finally I think that at the present you should study first and when you graduate you can work everything that you want.
