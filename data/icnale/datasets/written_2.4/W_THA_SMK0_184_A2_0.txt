I have no comment about this because my family's member is not smoking but I want to ban smoking but it impossible in Thailand and other countries in the world. I think we couldn't banned smoking because it's so impossible and we can't forbid them. Smoking can destroy the brain cell and can make human be sick and be not healthy. It' so hard and impossible to ban it because smoking is internationalism. when I was at school my friends in my classroom was smoking sometimes at the back of the school or in the toilets. They didn't care about the family much. They worried that the friends of them will laugh and don't like them to play together. Smoking is not good and no advertisement on media. But there are many sells in the internet and emails. Banned smoking is very difficult because it will make seller rich and can buy everything they need. The rich people always get everything that they want. Even we don't sell, they may go to another countries and bring a lot of cigarettes to smoke. It's hard to ban but it's possible to do. So, try to do but don't say it's hard to do without trying.
