People know that smoking is harmful to health, but many people have to involuntary smoking. In different places, there are different rules, for example, in the restaurants. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons. Firstly, there are many smokers in China. Not only the boys smoke, but also the girls do. I know many of my friends smoke. They all know that smoke does harm to their health, but they still smoke. They are addicted to it. If someone smokes, it harms himself as well as others. So taking into account the health of others, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, because restaurant is a place where many people stay. Secondly, Smoking in restaurants is an expense of others interests. People go to restaurants for a good meal; you smoke, so it is impolite to others. What's more, Gases produced by cigarettes polluted the environment in the restaurants. Many people dislike it, in addition, it probably influence people's minds. Above all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It will do good for ourselves. Then we can have a better body and a better environment.
