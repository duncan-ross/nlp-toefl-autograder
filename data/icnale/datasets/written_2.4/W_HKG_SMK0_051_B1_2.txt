The smoking ban in Hong Kong is taken effect since January 2007. Almost all of the smokers dissatisfy this ban as they claim that they have their right and freedom to smoke, at least a smoking area should be provided for them. On the other hand, most of the non-smokers applaud the government to carry out the ban as they also claim that they have their right to breathe in fresh air in public places. As a non-smoker, of course, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Some of my opinions will be demonstrated below. First of all, non-smokers have their right to breathe in fresh air. There are lots of disadvantages for breathing in second hand smoke. For example, lung cancer is definitely a consequence of frequently breathing in second hand smoke. Babies may lead to asthma and pregnant may get sick when breathing in the smoke. It might also be noted that smoking is bad for their health. Many figures showed that smoking leads to many diseases, especially lung cancer. Therefore, the government should try to encourage the citizens to abstain from this bad habit—smoking. After weighing both sides of the argument, in conclusion, there are many well-documented benefits to implementing smoking ban at all restaurants.
