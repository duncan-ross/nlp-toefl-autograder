College is a place for our youth to get knowledge and also to get more social experience. When we graduate we also need learning, I think the college is to educate people learning all your life, and learning even you are very busy. When we get into the society, we must to work, at the same time, we should keep learning. How to do the two things at the limited time, how to schedule your time. It's more important that the knowledge your learn. Do the part time job is very good way to help you scheduling the time. We go to college at the age 18 or 19, it's a special time. 18 means you are an adult. You must be learn to support yourself and know how to earn your live. You can't be a children hoping your parents' supply. Do the part job, the salary may not enough for you, but at least you know, you should do well now, for your future and your family. So I think it's important for college people to have a part time job. It's a useful thing to make our teenagers grow up well.
