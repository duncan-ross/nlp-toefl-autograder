As early as now in our college life, we must try to find a way in which we could help our parents especially on the financial need. Having a part time job will really help a lot on the carriage that our parents are lifting and are working for. We can help a lot even by simply covering the everyday expenses that we incur especially if we have younger brothers and sisters who also studies and needs money to go to school. We should not think of ourselves only anymore and instead do something to help our whole family. If we can get a scholarship, much better for it will be a really big help on your parents. All college students should remember that we are the future work force of our economy. Our country depends on us so why not contribute to the economy in as early as now in no matter what way we want to. Besides, this part time job that we might have will give us the experience that we need someday. We will not start from scratch anymore especially if we land on a job connected to the part time job we did. Having a part time job will teach us on how to face life on a mature way.
