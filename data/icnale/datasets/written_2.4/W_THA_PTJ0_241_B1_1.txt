For me I agree that having a part-time job is might be important for a college student. A part time job is a job in which an employee does not work full hours, so college student can take it. For if they have been got some part-time job while they are a student it is will be good for them because working part-time during college will build their character so they will get their own experiences. Sometimes they would learn how to solve the problems on their own because in today's tough job market, you need more than just a degree to get a job. For work experience also shows that you have had some real-world, adult experiences and that you can handle yourself outside of the classroom and off campus. With the price of living going up, so it is a good way to earn money with them self, that will help their father and mother a lot. They would realize that how difficult to make money, so that will make them more economy than ever. For all of above reasons would be a great lesson that they can't get from a class, because it is a "Reality", it is a true life.
