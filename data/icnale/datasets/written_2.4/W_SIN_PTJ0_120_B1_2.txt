I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because of one main reason --- the lack of time. Firstly, as a college student, there are various events both in and out of the school in which the student can participate in. For instance, there are inter-faculty games, ambassadors for incoming exchange students and special visitors from other countries, and other organisational and co-curricular activities. Taking up a part-time job would inevitably imply less time for these, which in my opinion, is a crucial part in the student life. Furthermore, future employers will more likely look at the student's leadership posts and other achievements in non-academic events, rather than to look at a part-time job experience at perhaps McDonald's, Cheers, or some other uneventful job. Next, as a college student, and especially in the competitive environment in Singapore, it is vital for students to achieve good grades. Furthermore, some companies explicitly state that only those with at least a 2nd upper Honours need apply for their job vacancies. As a result, the loss of good grades will affect the student's job prospects and career options. Thus, time is precious to students, and for some, simply focusing on academic progress would already take up almost all his/her time. However, in some cases, such as poor financial background, the student might opt for a part-time job to reduce the financial burden on his/her family. Although this is commendable, I feel that this would affect his/her future income, and it is a trade-off between reduced current financial burden and reduced future financial burden. Thus, I strongly believe that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
