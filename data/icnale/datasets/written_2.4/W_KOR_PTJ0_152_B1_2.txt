In Korea, while most students attend schools without a job, some students have part-time jobs. With the money, they do what they want, such as buying clothes. It is widely accepted that students should focus on their study, not a job. However, having a job has a positive influence on students First, students, at workplace, can learn what they cannot do in schools. In Korea, professors usually teach students only academic subjects, such as literature and physics. Even though these subjects are important in living a life, there are other important things, leadership or followership. In fact, it is difficult for students to apply academic subjects to social lives since these subjects are too theoretical. Therefore, after graduation, students who have not worked will have difficulty in dealing with their social tasks at their workplace unlike the ones who have had a job. Second, students can do various things with their money that they have earned from their jobs. Students with a job will make more money than their monthly allowance that they get from their parents. Parents do not give much money to their sons and daughters. Even if they give much money to them, students feel the lack of money. This is because they want to make up well and meet their lovers as well as go to trip with friends. Therefore, working at a part-time job, students can do what they really want with the money. In conclusion, since having a job can give students various experiences as I mentioned above, it is a good idea that college students have a part-time job.
