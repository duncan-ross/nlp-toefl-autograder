As a student, part-time jobs are a godsend for me. Even amidst the workload I have to cope with as a student, I choose to engage in part-time jobs as they are the main source of my income. Many of my peers take on part-time jobs for extra cash --- I, however, do not receive regular pocket money and the income from part-time jobs cover my daily expenses. When considering the type of part-time job to take up, I looked at factors such as time, remuneration and job satisfaction. A popular choice amongst university students is to take up tuition assignments, which is a profitable and manageable workload especially if the tuition subject coincides with your subject major. Fortunately, the demand for undergraduate tutors is as high as the supply of cash-seeking undergraduates, and the pay can range a satisfying 20 to 40 bucks per hour. I must say, however, as a friendly gesture of caution that one should not take up a waitressing job if one is not prepared to work long hours to receive a meager pay. While waitressing is indeed a brainless job that may be preferred by undergraduates who detest pedagogical tasks, the long hours and expectations of excellent customer service can take a tremendous toll in the physical and emotional well-being of the student.
