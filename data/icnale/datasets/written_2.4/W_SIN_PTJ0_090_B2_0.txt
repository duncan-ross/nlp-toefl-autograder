I disagree with this statement as I think that the ultimate objective of college education is to let students learn how to become independent learners who are capable of formulating and defending their original concepts and ideas. This is a long and tedious process which requires students to be focused and dedicated to learning their course of studies well. As college students approach their final year of college education, they also have to spend an increased amount of time on various projects and assignments which require them to conduct their own research on various topics with less help from their tutors or lecturers. I think that having a part-time job while attending college significantly reduces the amount of time and energy that students can spend learning on their own, and doing their projects. Although having a part-time job allows students to gain valuable working experience, and can also help students from lower-income families to pay for their tuition fees or personal expenses, the energy and time that students spend on their part-time job eventually detracts their focus from their studies. This may cause them to constantly find themselves in a fatigued state where they are unable to perform well in both their part-time job and their studies.
