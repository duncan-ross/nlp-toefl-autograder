College students are one step closer to face the real life, the life that they have to survive by themselves. Without asking for money from their parents, those students would find it difficult to live. It's going to be more difficult than that if they have to work to get their own money and spend it for their expenses. Obviously, it's necessary to experience a real situation before they graduate from a college, or you can call it a practice. I'm the one who totally agree with the thought that it is important that college students to have a part-time job. I used to work in part-time jobs before, and I do realize that it isn't easy to spend my money wisely without asking from my family. I have valued the hard moment of working to get the money. Some would say that it isn't that tough. But for they never work for their lives, so they will never understand a moment of having-no-money in the situation that you no longer depend on your parent. Thus, somehow you need to get the money, borrowing someone else's money for example. And that means you're failing on living your life moderately. Working part-time jobs doesn't only give you how to manage your money, but it provides you the experience of dealing with people who you might not know before. It will make you stronger. Therefore, it is really worth it to have a part-time job while you study in a college.
