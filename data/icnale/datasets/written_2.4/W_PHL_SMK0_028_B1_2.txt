Smoking is one of the causes of lung cancers. But why can't people stop it? I know, they'll only consider stopping when they're said to have the said diseases, caused by it. We all know that it's not only the smokers that get lung cancer, but also us. It is proven that, second hand smoking is more dangerous to your health. As a step of prevention, I think that smoking should be completely banned from every restaurant in the country. Why restaurants? It's where the most us commonly go. We Filipino's are food lovers indeed. And most of the people we see in restaurants are children. Why would we want to risk their health with a stupid mistake? We should be implementing this rule. Smoking is very bad to the health. Based on a survey made, 7 out of 10 people die every day due to smoking. Now, can we take that risk? No, we can't. Why do people even smoke? What do they get from it? Can smoking make them richer? No. Can smoking make them smarter? No. Here's one, smoking makes them an idiot. An idiot that takes his life at risk and an idiot who doesn't care about Mother Nature. In order to lessen smokers, Smoking must be banned in every restaurant in the country, not just it gives harm to the smokers ' health but also to the people surrounding them. And specially, how will you be able to eat properly and comfortably while smelling such foul and irritating scent? Isn't it a disrespect to those persons eating in the restaurant? So for me, smoking must be banned in restaurants.
