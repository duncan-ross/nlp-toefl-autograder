I do not quite agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Because it is have positive and negative effect for a student. It can be positive if the student who have a part time job can do his job and his study perfectly when the time for his job do not disturb time for the student to study. Beside his do study, it can make a money for his self or cost his study. Because I think it is not easy for student do a part time job and do study in a same time, it can make a student tired so can do it in a best condition. If that happens then the loss is the student's own. So I think a student would rather not do the job if not really necessary because it can cause a decline in learning achievement of students themselves. If it is forced to do jobs that should the students to divide their time between studying and working. Work can be done after the first priority to learn more because science is the future of the bridge so as to achieve what we dream during this. So make you dream with study.
