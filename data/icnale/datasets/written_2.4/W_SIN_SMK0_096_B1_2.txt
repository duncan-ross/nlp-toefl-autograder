Smoking on itself is a vice and not something that should be promoted in the country despite the lucrativeness of it being a revenue generator. In general, restaurants act as a form of dining, enjoyment or places of gathering for family and friends. If smoking were to be condoned in restaurants, it would entirely undermine the dining experience of restaurant customers if they were to enjoy their meals in heavy smoke and a strong tobacco smell wafting around. Put aside those customers that are willing to forgo their dining experience for the convenience of their smoker friends or relatives, second hand smoking is equally as harmful as first hand smoking. If smoking were to be condoned in restaurants, second hand smoking would not be a choice but somewhat a compulsory situation to be in. This might result in reduced revenue for the restaurants and on top of that, dining experience is no longer pleasant. Think of how growing children, toddlers would view the smoking if they were to see adults puffing away nonchalantly in a restaurant? In the long run, this might induce a form of incorrect misconception about smoking being something that should be condoned and eventually the smoking rate might rise in the country.
