Smoking should not be banned at restaurants anywhere and not at restaurants in Japan either. The fact of the matter is that people have a right to smoke before, during, or after their meal if they should so please, and it is not fair to them to tell them what they can and cannot do. In the same way, it is not fair for the nonsmokers to have to breathe and the smoke from cigarettes while they eat. Obviously, the best solution is to just have both smoking and nonsmoking sections in restaurants. If the architecture is good and the ventilation system works properly, you should not even be able to tell that there is a smoking area in a restaurant. This is good for the restaurants as well because it allows them to attract a larger number of potential clients and therefore they can make more money. That might have to spend some money to establish a nonsmoking section and a restaurant, but it will probably be made back in profits from all the new customers. If smoking is banned in restaurants, the only people who win is nonsmokers, and I don't think that that is fair to the restaurants themselves or the smokers.
