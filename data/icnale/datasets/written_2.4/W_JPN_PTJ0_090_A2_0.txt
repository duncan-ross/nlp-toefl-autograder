I agree with the opinion that a part-time job is important for college students. There are three main reasons. First, when they want to do some activities like traveling abroad with friends or members in the same laboratory, making money is one of big problems for them. To stay at their home is one of choice, but people should go anywhere to watch many things when they are young. If their parents are very rich, that is not so important. But the others should find a part-time job, work hard and get incomes. Second, when you work for any company, you meet many people including male, female, young and elder, this is also very important point to get a part-time job. Almost all college students are young so they don't have many experiences to decide the job they will do in the future. Therefore, they have to learn many things through the working there and hearing stories by a same company staff. In other wards, a part-time job is one of preparation for get a job in the near future. Third, when they accomplish some jobs, they will be confident and understand the social systems. This will also help college students get job and do good job in the future.
