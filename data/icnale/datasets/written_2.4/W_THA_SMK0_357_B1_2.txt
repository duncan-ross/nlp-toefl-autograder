I really agree with the statement "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country" because smoking is a bad thing. It can harm everybody. In nowadays, many people still smoking. Moreover, Smoking not only harm smoker but also harm another people. Smoking is banned in many places. Smoking is so dangerous and has many disadvantages. Sometimes many children maybe smoke follow their parents or people around them. It is not suitable model for those children. Moreover, smoking can harm the environment too. It causes the Global warming and Green House Effect. The restaurants are the public that serviced many people. If smoking is not banned in the restaurants, it will have many effects to all people or all sides. I think that the government should do something for stop smoking such as, plan the project that can banned at all restaurants in the country or tell everyone that smoking has many disadvantages especially teenagers etc. Furthermore, Smoking cigarettes are drugs that can harm organs in your body. So, I think everyone should be stop and banned smoking. When someone smoking or something bad happen not only you sad but also another people especially parents will sad because smoking causes dead. So, Don't bring the bad thing causes you lost your lover. You should stop smoking or banned it before it's too late. In summary, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in every places!
