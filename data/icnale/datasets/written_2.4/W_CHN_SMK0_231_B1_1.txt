Personally speaking, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, there are many smokers around us. They do need some space to smoke. Restaurants are not proper places for them, but that doesn't mean we should ban all the restaurants in the country. I think preparing some restaurants that only accept smokers is a good way to deal with the contradiction, for it can not only give the non-smokers a better environment but also give the smokers their own zone for smoking. Don't you think it is a good solution for them both? Moreover, if we ban smoking completely at all the restaurants, we may go against many smokers' will. At the same time, the government would be condemned by the smokers for it affects their benefit. In that case, they may do harm to the harmony of the society. Everyone has his own rights, so do the smokers. If we ban smoking at all the restaurants, we may break the balance of smokers and as a consequence lose their faith. In my opinion, we should open up some restaurants that are for smokers only. Only in this way can the society be more peaceful and harmony.
