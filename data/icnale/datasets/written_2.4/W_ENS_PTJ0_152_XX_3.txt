I agree that it is. Too many students don't understand the value of money and this would only add to their further education. There is no better way to increase financial skills than actually earning and controlling your own money. Many people do this very badly and they end up in serious trouble or even bankruptcy. If students start earning and learning as soon as they can about money and how to be use it wisely, if they get in trouble it is usually only for what many businesses would consider to be, small amounts and they can learn how to get out of it and what not to do next time. In other words, they can learn and make their mistakes cheaply instead of losing everything at some later stage in their lives. Money just doesn't just disappear. It merely changes hands or location and is still freely available at those locations. Students would also become a bit more financially independent, learns some basic household budgeting and it would also make them more attractive to potential employers once they graduate. There is nothing worse than sitting in a job interview and when asked what work experience do they have, and have to stare blankly and say that they have none. Any experience through part-time work would sound a lot better to interviewers than nothing.
