I agree and would give my support to a ban like this and not just in Japan. Everybody in the world must know by now, about the dangers of smoking for anyone that smokes and also to passive smokers. I am mildly surprised that Japan has taken it's time when considering this or should I say implementing it. I know that there are a few places in Japan where smoking is prohibited but that on its own is not enough. Food is prepared in restaurants and children go to family restaurants, so why doesn't whatever health authority or laws related to health and the food industry in Japan cover smoking in restaurants already. Cigarettes contain dangerous chemicals and toxins that kill and should not be allowed to just float through the air and settle on food or be inhaled by diners in any restaurant or food mall or let's take it a step further, in any public place. There are beaches in parts of the USA where smoking is prohibited so, why not restaurants in Japan. Time to wake up and remember that all of the deaths caused by smoking are preventable so, how about preventing them legally? Like say, now?
