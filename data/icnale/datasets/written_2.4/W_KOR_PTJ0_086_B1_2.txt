It is important for college students to have a part-time job. There must be different opinions over whether permitting the teenagers to work as a part time or not. Some people may claim that students' main job is to study and they are going to work in the future anyway. On the other hand, others will refute this claim by saying there are a lot things that students can learn working outside of school. Personally, I believe working in the teen age is beneficial for the following reasons. Working outside will provides opportunities to know one's interest to the youth. It is significant to know what one likes to do and is excellent at during teenage years because then, the student can make a choice of his major based on his interest when applying to universities and thus, what he will learn through college years will be helpful directly in his future career. In Korea, a number of people often get to work in a field which is totally different from one's specialized area. This is mainly due to the fact that college students realize their major studies are not really fit for their interest and what they want to learn for their jobs. This relatively late realization leads students to change their major in their junior or senior years and it enlargers their schooling spending more time and tuition. The worse case is that some people miss the time to change their field of study, gradate colleges, and try to find jobs that are nothing to do with their past studies.
