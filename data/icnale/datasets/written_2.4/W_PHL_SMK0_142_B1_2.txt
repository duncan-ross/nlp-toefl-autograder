There are two reasons to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. The first reason would be because of health purposes. A lot of people have already died suffering from diseases caused by the smoke. And it is not a quick, funny death. The death will be a slow, painful one - torturing one's mind and soul. So many organ dysfunctions can be the result from smoking cigarettes, pot, and also weed. Pancreas, liver, lungs, kidneys and some other body parts can all be shut down after consistently smoking for some time. Smoking in restaurants should be banned because the air inside the restaurant is tightly packed. When smokers light up their cigars, the smoke will tend to spread inside the room, therefore, polluting the small, full of foods area. I do believe the smokers tend to think they are cool when they are smoking, light up a match, put it on the smoke and blow the smoke to someone's face ain't cool to me though. It's a form of disrespect. Some are smoking usually for the sake of being relaxed. They will find living difficult old years of age if one is a heavy smoker even if it is during his/her young years. Moreover, there are people who will suffer more than the smoker itself. These people are the ones who inhale the smoke after the smoker exhales it. We call them the second hand smokers. You see, there is no benefit when smoking cigarettes. To prevent these kinds of tragic incidents, government should ban the production and supply of cigarettes, pot, weed and all other kinds of guilty pleasures in their local civilization. They should also prevent importing these.
