It depends on the situation. If a student wants to have more experiences before he or she steps into the job market, the student has better have a part time job related to the specific field. Nowadays many companies consider extra experiences outside university as valuable asset. Therefore, if one wants to get more opportunities in job market, it is highly recommended to have part time jobs before graduation. And also in case that a student has financial difficulties, the student has no choice but to have a part time job. Self supporting when attending university is difficult and can affect one's marks negatively. It does not mean that having part time jobs degrade one's over all university life. Rather, the difficult time that one spend to support oneself can be the preparing time for the future. However, if a student does not have to work for his tuition fee or for his living costs and he does not need to take part in some occupation for extra experiences, he does not have to have a part time job. Some students who major sports and art such as fine art, piano and other musical instrument might not need extra experiences, because they have to focus on improving their skills by themselves.
