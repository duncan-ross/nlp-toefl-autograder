The past several years has seen an ever-increasing number of college students take on part-time jobs. Some people argue that having jobs would take up too much of the students' time and therefore, impact negatively on the students' studies. As far as I can see, this argument is not really valid. Because many, many students all over the world, have taken jobs on and have still managed to graduate successfully. Yes, there is always a risk that students may fall behind. However, for students who are proactive in their job-hunting efforts, it is advisable for them to take part-time jobs or internships. Firstly, they will be gaining real business experience which is an added plus when students search for jobs after graduation and it is one of the reasons why I believe that part-time jobs are important. These days, any experience may just be the most critical criteria that lands the job when employers view applicant's resumes. Some studies have shown that around eighty percent of employers will look for job experience first, before checking academic results. Now there are people who may argue that this is unfair to students who have studied hard and gained excellent results but they lack work experience. The only answer to those arguments is that, this is the way the marketplace operates and it really comes down to survival of the fittest.
