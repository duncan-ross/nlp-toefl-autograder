According to the researches done by scientists recent years, smoking is bad for not only the smokers themselves, but for the people around as well, which is usually called secondhand smoke. But as is often the case we see every day, people smoke no matter they are, such as restaurants, parks and even on public transportation, thus causing so many people trouble. On the one hand, smoking does harm to people related; on the other hand, smokers also leave others a bad impression. To solve this serious problem, many countries call on people to stop smoking in public, some of them even ban people from smoking in the restaurants. This causes a wide debate, for many hold the opinion that they are deprived of their basic civil rights of a free lifestyle. However, the majority agree with this policy, thinking that it protects the most of the people. Banning smoking is necessary, taking the significance of restaurants into account, for if we have our meals with Nicotine every day, we can't totally absorb the nutrition, let alone health. Also, as most of the people think, smoking in public means a lack of social morality to some degree. All in all, banning smoking is very necessary and important. I think if everyone quit smoking, the environment will be better and we will be healthier as well.
