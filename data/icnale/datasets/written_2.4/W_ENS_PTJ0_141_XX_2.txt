I think that it would do the world of good if all students took on a part-time job while at college or university. I do have one caveat though and that is, that colleges should also provide some form of counselling or advice that would assist with preparing students in managing their time and their mind set, before going off in search of work. It always sounds easy to get a part-time job however, getting one and then keeping it while maintaining the required study levels is easier said than done for many students and they do struggle with it. Admittedly, there are a few students who handle both easily and without any apparent issues but in my opinion, these students are already in possession of the correct mindset and organisational skills or have learned them very quickly. For those with less experience, this may not be the case and I feel quite strongly that it is a lot easier to prepare than repair as the saying goes. Given the right preparation, all students should be able to combine both activities without mishap and also with the minimum of stress. This would allow them to not only enjoy the benefits of earning a wage but to also progress with their studies in a more relaxed and conducive frame of mind.
