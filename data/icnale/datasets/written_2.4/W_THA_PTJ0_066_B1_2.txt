I think that part time job of students is good and useful for students to use without asking for money from their parents because of when study in University, we need to control and work on myself a lot. Students can do a part time job but when you do the part time job you should also learn together. Part time job is a good thing, but it should be useful for students in their time studying and working properly. Study hard and do not find the money to find their own tuition fees as there would be no benefit. Most importantly, students should use the money to acquire what is beneficial to oneself does not apply to things that are not appropriate. Part time job may help students for make more money by yourself but also make student have less grade include Have less time for activities in they University. I can summary that part time job is a good thing will help students who have money enough problem but studying is the most important thing for student in University because good grades and graduate make students to work with success in life. Therefore, students should divide the time accordingly to their future. Learning in the college students just a few years, but students must bring their knowledge and experience acquired by the interests of future life.
