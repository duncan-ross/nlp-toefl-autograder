Nowadays, there are a lot of people smoke for several reasons. Someone smoking to relax or peer pressure. Nevertheless, someone wants to abstain from smoking but they can't because of addiction. I have been in a restaurant eating my food, then a cloud of smoke coming to me and I felt very bad. So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, three major reason that should be banned at the restaurants in the country. First, a cloud of smoke annoys the customers in restaurant. It effects on other customers who smell it. Healthy problem is second reason. Smoker may illness such as lung disease, heart attack, and etc. Third, if you do not smoke you can save your money. In the restaurant, some people want to smoke and enjoy their meal. I would think that they can smoke at the place where set up for them. Possible, you should abstain from smoking because it good for you In conclusion, I would think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it annoys other customers, it effects on the health's smoker, and it wastes the money uselessly.
