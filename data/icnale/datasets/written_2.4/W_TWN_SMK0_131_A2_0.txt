I think it is not polite to smoke in a public place. Because you can not do what you like when you are at a place there are many people with diffierent sourroundings. for these reasons I am agree with to banned at the restaurants in the country. Now in Taiwan many place are no smoke, and the policy let many people happy, because they would not have second smoke again. It is a big news, so many people who smoke are not agree it. But it is true and can not change faith. By the way, when people would smoke in restaurants, the air will be clear. And they can get more and more custmers who do not smoke. So great it is, and so many restaurant will follow the poloicy or they would be wrong. And now who smoke in the public place will be treat for money, and it is not small count. It is great that government set the poloicy and give me a great enviroment with eating food. So we should allow the laws and ask the people near us who smoke in public place like restaurants is not smart and not great. When we will start to change the people near us, we will change the world at all.
