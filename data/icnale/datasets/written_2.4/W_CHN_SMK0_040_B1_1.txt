Obviously, burning cigarettes damage smoker's health, and second-hand smoking is harmful to nonsmokers. So, holding the opinion that it is unfair for nonsmokers, some people claim that smoking should be quit in public places like restaurant in our country entirely. To be honest, I can't concede them anyway. Undoubtedly, as a nonsmoker, it is annoying to see other people smoking beside you. But for a smoker, when they lit up a cigarette in restaurant, a waiter come and politely ask him to smoking outside, he can also be irritated. People should have same right, despite whether he smokes or not. People have their right to smoke, just like they have their right do not smoke. We can't only consider one group people, but we should take them all in count. So, banning smoking in restaurant is greeting by people hate cigarettes, but it is unacceptable to smokers. Is there a compromising solution exist to let everyone satisfied? Of course, setting a smoking area is the simplest idea. It can solve the problem in a simple and inexpensive way. So why we should ban smoking in restaurant? I know that is many country of the world, smoking is not allowed in public places. For example, in Italy, smoking is not allowed in any place except private dwelling. And adults smoking in public places will have a pattern to children and teenagers. But we should make children know smoking is not good through teaching, not by making smokers invisible. I still believe that people have their right to smoke, and public should give them the convenience to smoke. From what I have mentioned above, it is not difficult to have this summary that smoking shouldn't be banned in restaurants.
