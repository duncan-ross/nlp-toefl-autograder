First I think, smoking can do harm to our healthy. It can bring a bad disease——lung cancer. According to the statistics, there are 600 000 people died of lung cancer every year in china. And 85% people would be died once they have it. So smoking is a way of killing in a slow way. Smoking should be banned, and we have no time to wait. Second, smoking is a special action, it not only destroys smokers healthy, but also hurts others body. Because the air which be polluted would be draw into their lung. And restaurants are public place, and there are so many people who can be hurt by smoking. It is so important to take actions to make smoking is banned at public, of course, at all restaurants.
