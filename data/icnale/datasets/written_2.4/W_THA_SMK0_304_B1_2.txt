I strongly agree with that because it is a big problem nowadays. Smokers spend a lot of money to buy cigarettes. In spite of they know cigarettes have many disadvantages, they still smoke. I don't know the advantages of cigarettes, but I know the disadvantages of them well. Smoking destroys our health, especially smokers' health. Smoking causes cancer. Smoking causes pollution. Now there are many smokers around the world. A number of new smokers are increasing everyday although cigarettes are very expensive. Cigarettes are not useful things. In the restaurant must not have smoking area for people are healthy and smoking must be strictly prohibited because smoking makes people in the restaurant don't enjoy their meals, feel bad, and sick. Atmosphere in the restaurant isn't clean. However other places should not have smoking area for reducing amount of new smokers and people will be healthy. I always think that environment and atmosphere are very important. People don't want to smell the smoke of cigarettes during they have dinner. They want clean atmosphere. I feel bored every time when someone smokes near me. If all restaurants in the country can do that, environment in those restaurants will be clean exactly. People will be healthy, impressive, and happy forever.
