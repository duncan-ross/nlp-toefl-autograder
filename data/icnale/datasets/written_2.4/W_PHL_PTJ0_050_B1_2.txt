The poverty in the Philippines decreases rapidly, due to the lack of education and unemployment given to the people. With the new program made by the Aquino Administration, the burden of the marginalized Filipino families in making their children study worsened. Practically not only the parents should work for their children's education but also the children themselves. Due to the new curriculum given by the government, this would enable the students to work while studying. In my opinion, it is important for the student to work while having his education because they tend to learn more through experiences. Works just don't give salary for the working students; they also give sufficient experiences that the students can apply to their academics. On the other hand, the student might find it hard to balance education to their work. They may end up focusing on their jobs that they might be able to forget to study for their academics. However, this experience could help the student's to learn how to manage their time that may help them and grow to a more matured individual. Education would always be important to a person; it would always depend on the student whether or not they would help their parent with their own education.
