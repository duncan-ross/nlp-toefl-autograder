In the restaurants have many people whether children or the elderly and there are some people for smoking. If you are the one who does not smoke and you do when you see people smoking in restaurant. You should be alert to him but you wouldn't dare same me. It is very bad smell and I don't like it. In order to protect children and some people not smoking because of the smoke of cigarette can harm health of people not smoking, at the restaurants is the public place, smoke can taste changes and is a bad example for children because in restaurant have many children. Therefore the country must to set the law about banned smoking at all the restaurants or open zone for smoker at all. In order to protect the people not smoking from smoke of cigarette. And the law should be strict and should punish people that smoke in public because will have some people smoking break the law if this law not strict. But some places should except the law such as pub and bar because pub and bar of drinking and drug. But the country should set the low for protect many people not smoking.
