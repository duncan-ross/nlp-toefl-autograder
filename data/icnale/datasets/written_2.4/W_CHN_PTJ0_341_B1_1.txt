It has become a trend that more and more college students do part time job outside. In my points of view, it's totally necessary for college students to do part time job. First of all, doing part time job can help widen one's horizon. We has spent most of time on study for almost nine years. Little time do we have to see what things are like in social, not to say practicing our social skills. Therefore, we should go out and do part time job when we are in college, in which time we have less pressure in study. What we learn when doing part time job will definitely equip us well for the coming society. Doing part time job has more advantages than this. The time we should do part time job is relatively stationary. So we need not go outside time and time to find social work to do. What's more, we can get some money from doing the job, which will cease our parents' stress with money. These are the reasons why we should choose doing part time jobs instead of other social work during college time. All in all, doing part time job does lots of good for us. And college students should do part time job.
