Smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking has already been banned at all the restaurants in my home state, and it is unfair. It would be much fairer if they just kept it so that all the restaurants have a smoking and a nonsmoking area. That way, everyone is happy. But now, since smoking has been banned in restaurants, it is harder for the smokers to enjoy their nights out. Only the nonsmokers have benefited by this decision to ban smoking in restaurants, and it is not fair to make rules that only help some people. I also don't think that Japanese smokers will be happy if smoking is banned in their restaurants, so they should not ban it. I know that smoking is bad for my health, and I do plan to quit one day, but for the time being I think that it is fine. A lot of college students smoke, and it is a good way to meet new people and enjoy talking with friends at parties. Smokers do not want to hurt anybody, and we are people just like everybody else, please don't charge all of us based on the actions of only a few rude people.
