Among the little experiences I had at various work stints, the one job I enjoyed tremendously was my time at a local primary school. It was a nerve-wrecking experience during the first week, as I recall, because not is the school my alma mater, I did not have prior teaching credentials. But as the days grew longer and my command of the arsenal of tools that teachers had over their students expanded, I learnt to love my job and the children I taught. Some days, I could honestly say that corporate punishment deserves to stay in mainstream school in order to keep the teachers sane, but on others, I appreciated the youthful spirit and intellectual curiosity that these 10-year olds were displaying. It didn't matter that most were struggling with basic Math problems, since it was a neighborhood school, because you could see the equal passions in the teachers to help these students develop as best as they could. And then, there was Peter Tan. I taught him when he was in Primary 3 and the only thing I could remember initially was what a rascal he was. He sat behind a bunch of prudish girls, and he never failed to get them annoyed by the end of first period. It was partly annoying on my side because I had to get him to stop, and partly amusing because Peter was pulling off some of the funniest pranks on his classmates. Did I also mention that Peter was scoring a string of As in his examinations? Some pupils do have it all I suppose. Perhaps one day I shall take time off my own rollercoaster of life and revisit this old passion.
