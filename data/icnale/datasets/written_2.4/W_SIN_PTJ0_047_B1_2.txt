One reason it can be important for college students to have a part-time job is to be able to find the work-life balance that will inevitably be encountered once they graduate. College students should eventually be able to cope with the stress of managing assignments and tasks from school as well as their jobs. Furthermore, the remuneration from the part-time job can reduce the financial burden of paying for college fees. On the other hand, college students should also stay committed to completing their assignments and projects from school in order to achieve the desired grades for graduation. Having a part-time job may take some of the precious time away that could have been well spent on revision or completing assignments with better quality. Students who are unable to perform up to standard as a result of not being able to have enough time to complete their assignments may see themselves struggling to keep up with the progress. Nevertheless, there should always been a good balance of managing time well for school work as well as part-time job work. Ultimately college students should always strive to gain work experience apart from the skills learnt in academia, in order to be well-prepared for endeavours beyond graduation.
