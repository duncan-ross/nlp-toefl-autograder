I think that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. Nowadays, smoking becomes more and more popular in almost every situation. No matter at home or in public places you can always find that someone is smoking. The air is filled with smoke. I hate smoke and smoking, so I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in public places especially in the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is bad to smokers' health. It will shorten their lives. What's more, it will do more bad to the people around. Their families, friends and others will be forced to smoke. This would be a quite terrible thing. Secondly, smoking in the restaurant can be even worse. When other people are eating and drinking, the smoke flies to them, around their nose, mouth even the whole body. They will feel extremely angry and terrible. Many people used to smoking when dining. You can often see this scene: a man is drinking with a cigar in his hang. This action is not cool but impolite to others. Above all, smoking so harmful and terrible that we should ban it the restaurant.
