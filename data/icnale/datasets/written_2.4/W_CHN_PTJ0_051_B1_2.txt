When I enter the university, I find that having a part-time job became popular among the college students. Why most college students eager to find a part-time jobs? However, I suppose the students who find the part-time jobs and I have my own opinion about this. Firstly, doing part-time job can provide us an opportunity to learn the skills which cannot learn from the school. If we have a part-time job, such as being a waiter in a restaurant or a shop assistant, we may have more chances to learn how to get on well with the guests and it also provide us the experience which may help us after we graduate from school. Secondly, as we spend time on part-time job, it can force us to scheme our time-table well. As we known, many college students think college life is very boring because they have fewer classes than before. If we have a part-time job, we will never feel boring for we should do the part-job. Thirdly, having part-time job can develop students' independence. When we earn our wage, we can release our parents' financial pressure. In summary, I trust that having a part-time job can make our college life more colorful and we should cherish the chance to have a part-time job.
