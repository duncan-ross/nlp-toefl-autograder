Without really knowing much about the culture or the people of Japan, it would be a little ignorant for me to make a statement on this issue that would have any real impact. However, I am comfortable in stating my opinion that smoking is a terrible habit, and I try to avoid smokers in my personal and professional life as much as possible. Is extremely frustrating to work with somebody who has to leave several times throughout the hour to go engage in some activity that is literally killing them by the day, and I do not wish this fate upon even my worst enemies. As one continues their career in college, one expects himself/herself and also the people around them too overall become smarter and better people. Smoking is kind of a curious habit that has remained for reasons I cannot fully understand, but I hope that one day soon we will not have to worry about it anymore. The number of deaths every year from smoking is higher than the number of deaths from car crashes and other accidents combined, and the figures really speak volumes about the choices people are making which have direct influences on their very lives. If I had to say one way or the other, I think it would be better to lean towards the side of caution and just go ahead and ban smoking at the restaurants in Japan.
