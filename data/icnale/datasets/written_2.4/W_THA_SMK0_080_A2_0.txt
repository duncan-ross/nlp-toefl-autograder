I agree with banning smoking in restaurants because it might negatively impact of the atmosphere in the restaurant. Besides, cigarette smoke makes no harm to the body that are the ones who smoke and those around. Causing many diseases have come followed such as cancer, heart attract. The shop should be held the policy or campaign for banning smoking. If all restaurants cooperate with each other, the number of smokers will drop down and all is gone at the end. In school, there should be a campaign also to teach students to not try to smoke. The teachers may show the pictures about people who got effects from smoking. Students may discuss how smoking is dangerous or how it harms people. They may discuss about advantages and disadvantages. Then they may see the results how less advantages they can think of smoking and how amount of effects from smoking they found. It is not only restaurants to decide to ban the smoking, the country should support them too. If the government support, it will be stronger and people will follow without argument. It is another suggestion to promote banning smoking in all restaurants. Someone should start this campaign as soon as possible.
