Recently, there are argues on smoke-banning in restaurant. Owing to smoke would interrupt other's dinner in restaurant. As for me, I think smoking should be banned in restaurant and followings are my opinion supported it. Smoke is not healthy at all. It do harm to our body and worst of all, it could caused cancer. According to the research, not only people who smoke but those who breathe in second-smoke would be probably to have cancer as well. I think it really make sense that our government announce that smoking in public is strongly forbidden. Then, it's necessary that restaurants must offer fine environments to customers for dinning. Once a person smokes in the restaurant, the smell will spread out the whole room. The smell of the smell would make others uncomfortable while having dinner. Last but not at least, if the smoke buttons be dumped at ease, it may cause serious fire. We have the duty to abbey the regulation that not to smoke in public place. All of above are my opinions that agree with the smoking forbidden rule. There are few suggestions that can solve the problem. Set smoking areas that can be offered to people would smoke. Separate the smoke area and non-smoke area to make whole dining environment clean. Put a sigh shows that smoking is not allowed here to warn smokers. But most of all, if smokers would like to get rid of the smoke, it would be much better; and it is necessary that smoke should be banned at all restaurant.
