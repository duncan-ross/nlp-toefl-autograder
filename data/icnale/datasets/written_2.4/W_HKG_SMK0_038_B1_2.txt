In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Restaurants are places for people to eat, chat and relax, but not to suffer. It is painful for those non-smokers to bear the bad smell from smoking while they are enjoying the delicious food with their family, friends etc. Since the region affected by smoking is very large, and also the tables, seats in restaurants are very closed to each other, it is unavoidable that non-smokers will become second-handed smokers during the time seating near the smokers. Someone may argue that smoking is a kind of relaxing for the smokers. It may be true for them, but the problem is that smoking is harmful to the health of smokers, and even the people around them. Just like homicide, some crazy people may think that this is a kind of relaxing but it is not acceptable by the society because this is immoral and cause physical damages to someone's body. Smoking is similar, one has no right to hurt the others just because he/she wants. On the other hand, there is no medical proof that the cease of smoking will affect the health of smokers. Apart from health, smoking may cause other problems such as the outbreak of fire, which is even a worse case. Smoking and non-smoking areas are also not good enough, since the number of customers who smoke or not are very hard to predict, and hence very difficult for the managers to divide the areas, and if the size of the areas are not fixed, some non-smokers may have to use the seats which is previously in the smoking areas and hence may have to bear the remnants, smell, from the previous smokers. This measurement cause a lot management problem.
