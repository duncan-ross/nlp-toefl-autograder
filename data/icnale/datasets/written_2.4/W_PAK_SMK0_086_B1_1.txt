Smoking is a bad addiction to cigarettes. Once a person falls in victim of it, it is very difficult for him to avoid smoking. It is most common in our youth now but most of our elders are also having this bad habit. I think so people are illiterate and don't know about the harmful aspect of smoking. Even if they know, still they are so badly addicted that they remove or finish this bad habit. People become addicted to smoking due to bad company and accepting free offers of drug pushers. Now a day it is too much spread not only in foreign countries but in Pakistan too up to great extent. Health is wealth. But I think so this proverb is useless and meaningless because people are wasting their money or wealth on much useless thing which instead of benefiting them, they only spoiling their whole lives and money and creating serious tension for themselves and their parents. Smoking is a course. It is very harmful to human life and also to the nature and environment. Smoking is often prohibited in restaurants and other public places but most of the people disobeying the rules to do smoking. The smoke of cigarette and cigars are taken in the body along with food. And people other than smoker become chain smokers and are harmed too. Cigarette and smoking is the major causes of lung cancer and other skin and respiratory diseases. The smoke along with food contaminates it and spoils the beneficial Aspects and effect of food and our body do not get nutrition. Hazart Muhammad (PBUH) has also prohibited and said to avoid the addiction prevailing things. Smoking must be strictly banned in restaurants and hotels. They intoxicate the mind and also have become a major cause of early death rates. We must save our life and others and should not follow these bad habits and should make our country prosper.
