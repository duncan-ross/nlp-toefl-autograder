For the question if part-time job is important for college students, my answer is it depends on their social status and decision of their parents. For those students that belong in high-class society, it is not necessary for them to take any part-time jobs. They will just finish their studies and work or manage their own family business. For middle-class like me, some take part-time job for their own allowance, to help their parents for the expenses but there are also parents who never let and will not allow their children to take part-time job because their reason is they want their children to focus in their studies then find a work after they graduated college. For students that really need to work for their tuition, allowance, book fees and other expenses in school and in their houses, it is important for them to have a part-time job to help them for their expenses and to help their parents who working so hard just to enroll their children in a great school. Having part-time job can help us be responsible, know how to budget money and having part-time job during college can build our character. We will know how much the value of the money that we get from our hardwork. We will know how and we will spend it in important things. Lastly, college students that have part-time job don't need to ask for money from their parents for their own needs and wants like a gadgets, clothes, and everything else and that are less burden for their parents.
