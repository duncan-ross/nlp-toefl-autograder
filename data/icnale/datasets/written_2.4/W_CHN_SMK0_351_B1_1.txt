There is no doubt that smoking is harmful. It not only does harms to the smokers but also to the people around. Smoking in public is regarded as an impolite behavior. And banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country should be agreed. Restaurants should provide customers a comfortable place to eating. And it is obvious that nonsmokers won't feel at ease when there is a person dragging away. Smoking in the restaurants not only does harms to nonsmokers' health, but also affects their emotions when eating. So it is reasonable to banning smoking in all the restaurants. The ban will make smokers feel unease when eating in the restaurants. This, however, will benefit smokers a lot. They think it to be inconvenient if they smoke, and then they have to think about quit smoking. My father smokes, he has been hooked by over 30 years. He never thought about quit smoking and excused that it is too hard for him to quit smoking. However, he gradually found that it is more and more inconvenient if he smokes because there are more and more NOSMOKING signs in public places. And now, he has to try to quit smoking. Although banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country seems to be very strict for smokers, it benefits both smokers and nonsmokers.
