I agree with this statement. I have three reasons for this. First, we can learn the worth of money from working at a part-time job. This means that if we don't work ourselves, we can't know how hard we work to earn money or make a living. I think this is a really important thing for us in the future. Second, we students often eat lunch or dinner outsides or hung out with our friends, so we need some money to do that. But I think university students should get money on their own because we can work at a part-time job. Finally, we can freely spend money we earned by ourselves. It's also important because it makes opportunities to do something new we've never done. For example during the spring or summer or winter vacation, we can go abroad to take a trip or learn a foreign language. However, we must not forget our main purpose that students should learn while in college. I think this is the most important thing. So we will be able to learn time management with checking our schedule, taking some notes and so on. That's why I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
