I agree with the statement. For college students, a part-time job is a part of experience of life. I think, through we try new things, include experience of part-time jobs, we will understand social systems and learn many ways. For example, ways to treat customers, to cook, to wash dishes, to operate mechanical machines, to work with colleagues, and etc. Thanks to much experience, we will be a member of society. We can grow in a point of society, as if we are tapping a step. Some college students have a part-time job, others do not. While, some want to have, others do not want. But I would like to have one. Because of not only that reason, but this one. Trough I experience variety things, I want to know many people each other and get along with many people. So, I will think to tap a step. And want to tap one more step. It will continue forever, since I do not want to try new things. So, I agree with the statement. College students should have one, and they can have variety experience. Probably it is had only in doing a part-time job. We can, as college students, enjoy a part-time job now. In other words, we can do only now. Maybe, after we graduate from our colleges, we can't enjoy. Because we don't have a space of mind, we will suffer from doing.
