I agree if smoking at all restaurant and other public facilities banned. Because smoking is not good for our health. Besides that, this activity also can disturb other people. For example if you in the restaurant and there is someone or some people smoking beside of you, I think you will be disturbing. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic that very dangerous for our health. Like toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde and many others toxic. There are many disease caused from smoking activity, there are lung cancer, cardiovascular, bronchitis, and asthma. Bans on smoking in restaurants can substantially improve the air quality. If smoking will not banned, I think the air quality in the word will so bad. Laws implementing bans on indoor smoking have been introduced by many countries in various forms over the years, with some legislators citing scientific evidence that show tobacco smoking is harmful to the smoker themselves and to those inhaling. Our government is also bans smoking in our country. Such as make wanted in the package of cigarette. That wanted contains if smoking can causing some disease such as lung cancer, cardiovascular, bronchitis, and asthma. But that wanted is not useful, because some of Indonesian people don't know about the dangerous of smoking. Additional rationales for smoking restrictions included reduced risk of fire in areas with explosive and flammable hazard, cleanliness in places where food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other flammable things.
