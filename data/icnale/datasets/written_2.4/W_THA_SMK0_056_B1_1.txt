I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's very good project for Thai people. Nowadays, there are many smokers in our country, but we are not the smokers. We don't have to bear the smoke from others who are smoking without paying attention to others. Not only we must ban smoking but we must also help others who are smoking to quit smoking. If we only ban, it is not work way to stop smoking because if we only ban smoking in the restaurant, anyone who is smoking will go to another place to smoke so they will make trouble for others who live in the place that he changes to. Smoking is the big problem in our country because there are a lot of second smokers. The second smokers who are not smoking are made from the first smokers who are smoking. They (second smoke) will be unhealthy because of smoke from first smokers. I think we must ban smoking at all the public places not only at all restaurants. For those who are smokers, you must stop smoking for anyone you love. This is the best way to make you healthy and you will be proud of you yourself that you can help others from second smokers.
