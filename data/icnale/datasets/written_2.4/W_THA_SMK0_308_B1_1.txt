I agree with that because smoking is not good for health. It not good for yourself and anybody around you even they don't smoking but if they smell it, it cause of a cancer for them or any other decease. Smoking in restaurants it disturb everybody who come to eat it can make they upset with that. How do you feel if you don't smoke but have to smell it. For me, I always have an headache when I smell the cigarette. I really don't like it but I just don't know how to stop people that are smoking. Smoking will destroy your body it makes you like a zombie. Your eyes and your lips will look awful and terrible. You mouth got very bad smell too. Both men and women, if you smoke, you never look good with cigarette. Restaurants should banned smoking all in the country. There should be rules and fine if someone breaks the rules. No smoking in restaurants is make an atmosphere better and everyone will come to eat more. May be the restaurants will allow to smoke outside but people who smoke shouldn't smoke in the publish area they should smoke in private area for make sure that will not avoided the other people.
