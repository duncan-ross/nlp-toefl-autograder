I go to *** University by train everyday. Every time I ride in the do or in the front of a smoking are at Shinimamiya station which is on my way to the school. When the train arrives there, businessmen with smoke ride on it. They can extinguish their cigarette but cannot remove their smoke. The smoke is bad smell and does harm to people near the smoker. So, I don't like cigarettes and smokers. Most people dislike the smell. The smoke left the smell with clothes, hair and rooms, and have a big bad influence on not only adults but children. The Star backs Coffee bans smoking because the customers can't enjoy the scent of coffee with smoke. This instance can be applied to the restaurant. We go to a restaurant to eat delicious dishes. So, restaurants prohibit smokers from smoking. If a restaurant makes nonsmoking and smoking seats, a group may have to separate into two groups. It costs to design the inside of restaurants and attach exhaust system to there for making nonsmoking area. Therefore the restaurant completely banned smoking. Some of the many smokers want to quit smoking but can't stop because they are addicted. This prohibition may be good opportunity.
