I think that I would agree but unless students get a reasonable wage from their part-time job, it may not be enough and it could very well be necessary to have 2 or more jobs just to make ends meet. In New Zealand, many students are struggling on the meagre earnings that they are currently earning and it is nigh on impossible for them to pay any education fees and have money to live on as well. Many receive no funding from their families at all and if they don't have a job, they may be entitled to some government assistance but even then, it is not enough. It is very difficult for them to study and try to survive if they are the only breadwinner and the drop-out rate has been climbing steadily. I believe that the governmental needs to provide greater support for those students whether that would be by some form of increased stimulus package or monetary payments, I don't know. What I do know is that they need to act fast before the situation gets even more out of hand than it already is. Clearly, these kids want to study but they need to be able to live as well and all they really asking for is just hand up not a handout.
