I disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because the most important thing is whether people who don't smoke feel bad. I hate the smell of cigarettes. Because once the smoke touched clothes, it is hard to removing the smell. Neither I hate the smoke, because the smoke badly influences on people who are around smokers. But we often don't feel bad because many restaurants and offices separate the smoking area and non-smoking area. In these days, many restaurants make 2 areas; smoking area and non-smoking area. Some shops make the rule to ban smoking in the lunch time. I like these ideas separating smokers and non-smokers because these ideas will make all people happy. But when the non-smoking area is full, non-smokers have to enter the smoking area. So restaurants should research the number of customers, and set reasonable number of tables. Also restaurants should put walls between these two areas to stop entering the smoke into another area. Actually the smoke makes our health bad, and has nothing good. But many people love smoking, so I think banning smoking completely is not right. Some good ideas will make our lives comfortable.
