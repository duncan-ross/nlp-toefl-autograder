 Should smoking be forbidden in public places? I strongly hold the opinion that it must be stopped. There do exist uncountable harms of smoking in the public and I'm urged to see the ban against smoking in practice in a larger scope. As we all know, smoking does harms to our body and ruins our health. The smoker himself or herself inevitably suffers from the poisons that exist in the small cigarette. And on the other hand, people around him or her will have to be the second-handed smokers. Exposed in this condition for a long time, the innocent people will tend to be in poor health. Secondly, smoking in the public can also lead to many tragic accidents, such as conflagration. In 2002 of Xi'an, a large nightclub was on fire, heavy smoke constantly sent off from the building. The accident caused dozens of deaths, shocking people around the country. There are still many other tragedies caused by the small cigarette, and we don't want to see them happen again and again. After looking back on them, we can see the urgent to forbid smoking in the public, especially in places which can easily catch fire. But to be frankly, if too much pressure are put on the smokers, they would probably pour scorn on the ban. So, I think some cubs should be set especially for smokers, just like the divided smoking area and no-smoking area. Considering the foreseeable harms and hidden danger of smoking in the public, there is no time for the government to focus on this issue.
