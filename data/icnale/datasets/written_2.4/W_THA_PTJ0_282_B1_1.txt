I agree with the working class because I think it is helping himself earn the school and help alleviate the burden parents. I want everyone to have a job during school. As an experience to work. Working for your self the experience. It is learning is working with others. However if working in the school should not upset the students. Therefore, we should have a good time management in order to not upset the student. If we divide the time it would not lose both. Notice that today, everyone scramble for work. Since money is the main focus of all of them. All people of all ages are spending obligations. Therefore, the work part-time job is the solution. There are many places open to students during class to work as MK, KFC, FUJI, shopping mall, restaurant, Ministry of various and other. Every place that allows children to work. I think the chance of running it should take the win. I see some people work part-time job many to have the opportunity to talk with him. He was sent to school themselves. Home without enough money. He has things that he want to own his own. He fought with himself. He said that experience will teach us. Finally, I would like to leave that opportunities available for anyone who wants but in our choice of how to use it
