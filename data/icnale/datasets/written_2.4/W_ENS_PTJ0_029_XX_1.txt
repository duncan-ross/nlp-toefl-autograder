What many people do not understand about college or cannot recall from their own college experience is that having a part-time job puts a lot of strained on the students who have to find a way to complete all of their schoolwork while at of the same time finding a way to have enough time to do some part-time work so they can earn some money for whatever purposes. College is and always has been a learning institution, and the fact that some students feel compelled to do anything other than learn there is somewhat tragic because this degrades the prestige of a college degree as well as taking away some of the knowledge that the students might have gained if they had spent more time or had more time to study. On the other hand, there are some select individuals who seem to be able to cope very well with the stress of both school and work, and I think these individuals are responsible and mature enough to do as they feel is right. Choosing to work in college really is a personal choice, but I don't feel that college student should be given so much pressure to start their lives in the workforce when they are still just kids.
