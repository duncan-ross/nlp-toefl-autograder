Everyone needs money for living. Money is very important for our life. Many students have a part-time job and also many students don't have any part-time job. I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job because having a part-time job is quite good for college students who want to help their parents. Having a part-time might be good for college students who need experience. I see many rich students having a part-time job because they want to have an experience for their life. I think having a part-time job will let you learn how to survive your life by yourself. I think it would be great if you can manage your pocket by using your own money, not your parents. If you have a part-time job, you will understand the word "learning with studying. " For disagree, when you have a part-time job, it means you have more duty or more responsibility. You will get more tired. And it may effect to your studying. Your grade is going down. So, you have to make sure with yourself that you have enough patience and you can manage your time very well. In conclusion, having a part-time job is important or not important, it depend on you. Just try to do your best.
