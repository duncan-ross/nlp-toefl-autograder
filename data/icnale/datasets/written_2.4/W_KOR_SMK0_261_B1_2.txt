Smoking at not only restaurants but all the public places should be banned by law. It is very harmful to smoker him or herself but it is much more harmful to people around the smoker. While and after people smokes they makes terrible odor, making people feel disgusted. Particularly in restaurants people rest while having their meal. More than just eating, people do many things at restaurants. They talk with each other, date, relax, enjoy foods that they can't have at home, and relieve stress. If people just want to fill their stomach at restaurants, they don't have to go there and just eat at home. Also, people share a space called restaurant together. It is not a separated place like hotel rooms. At this shared place, people should be polite and not deprive others' right to spend their time in comfort at the place. People who don't smoke usually don't like the smell of smokers and hate it when somebody smokes around them and let them breathe in noxious cigarette smoke. If it happens at restaurant, where they spend money to eat and rest, it is definitely invading other peoples' right. Therefore, smoking at the restaurants should be outlawed.
