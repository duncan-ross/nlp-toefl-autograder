A smoker's (poor) choice should not affect the health of others. Smoking can make our body sick and not healthy because cigarette have many dangerous substances. The smoke of cigarettes contains hundreds of toxic chemicals. There are Nicotine, Tar, etc. But nicotine is very dangerous substance which be found in cigarette. Smoking can cause cancer, coronary heart disease, impotency for men, respiratory problems, and many other diseases. Smoking in the restaurant very bad for healthy because in the restaurant many person eat. Non smokers should not be subjected to this disgusting habit. Because if we eat in the restaurant and then someone smoking in the area so we will feel not comfortable and we will be not healthy. Passive smoking more than dangerous than active smoking. I'm have a Idea for prevent a smoking in the restaurant. In the restaurant must warning No Smoking in Restaurant. A smoker ill still have the right to smoke in his own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with. Wanting to ban smoking in public places isn't about taking away a smoker's rights. So if there are person smoking in the restaurant, the person must pay a fine from restaurant side.
