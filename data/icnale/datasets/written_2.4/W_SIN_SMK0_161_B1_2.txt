Personally, I feel that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. With the increasing number of reports broadcasting the health risks of smoking, it is to the benefits of the public that smoking is banned in all restaurants. This is especially so given that restaurants are patronised by families of all ages. With the presence of non-smokers and children, smokers pose a health risk. This is further supported by the fact that second-hand smokers, which refers to people who do not smoke yet inhale the smoke due to presence of smokers nearby, are subjected to a higher risk of lung cancer. Being a serious health issue, it is to the benefit of the public that smoking is banned in family-oriented places such as restaurants. It may be argued that complete banning will put the smokers at the losing end as they are deprived of the basic rights to smoke. It may also raise the issue of social discrimination. I agree with this point and such a social issue is indeed a sticky issue to deal with. However, I believe that with the support of the family members of smokers, the probability of this happening can be lessened. For instance, family members can encourage smokers to quit smoking to gain social acceptance. This may take a very long time and there is a low success rate of success, but their attempts to quit smoking will be worthwhile and applaudable. Hence, in all, I find that we should completely ban smoking in restaurants because of the health risks involved. Although the tacky problem of social discrimination will arise, it can be lessened with the emotional support from the smokers' family members as well as the society. Hence it is to everyone's benefit that smoking is completely banned in all restaurants.
