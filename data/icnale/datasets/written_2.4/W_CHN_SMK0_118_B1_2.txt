 Surely smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As is known to all, smoking is harmful to our health, so it should be banned at all the public places. Restaurants are one of the public places. Moreover, they are the public places where you have meals. If some people smoke in the restaurants and you are a non-smoker, can you stand your health being ruined while having your dinner? As for people who are sensitive to the smoke of cigarettes, their appetite will be affected by the annoying smoke and they are not likely to enjoy their food. If bosses of restaurants are afraid to lose the guests who are smokers, I suggest they should also consider the guests who are non-smokers. The ban on smoking can even bring in more guests, given the atmosphere of restaurants. A bright restaurant is much more pleasant than the one that is full of cigarette smoke. You can't imagine that many people smoke at a five-star restaurant, can you? Forbid smoking and then the level of your restaurant will be promoted. Anyway, I'm for the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
