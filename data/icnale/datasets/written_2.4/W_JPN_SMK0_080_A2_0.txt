I agree with this statement. Because I know it harms them and also us not smoking people. I think it is the kind of criminals in the view of harming innocent people in the public space; in this case it is restaurants. And I think that restaurants are the spaces where we can eat and drink expensive or delicious foods and drinks, so it is important for restaurants to provide us the spaces where we can feel this unusual time well. In this way, smoking in restaurants is bad for us not smoking people, probably can't concentrate on tasting those and sometimes feel sad or get angry. So I can't understand the people smoking in restaurants even if someone sits around them. I think they lost the part of heart that being kind to the people around them because they are addicted in smoking. I think that smoking may changes your character in this way. If smoking at all the restaurants is completely banned, we can enjoy diner at the restaurants, and never be annoyed of smoking. I pray that it comes true in the future in Japan. Then Japan becomes the comfortable society to live in if you don't smoking.
