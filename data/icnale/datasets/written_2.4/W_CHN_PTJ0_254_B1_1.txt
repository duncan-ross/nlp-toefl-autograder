 I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. No matter how good it is to take a part-time job for a college student, his first duty is study. Someone think that they can learn more knowledge in a part-time job, but not everyone can pay the time and energy. I strongly believe only the students who have the ability to do well in their class can have a part-time job. For most college student, it is not an easy thing to grasp all the knowledge that they must know. If these students just think have a part-time is important and use up their time to do the job, how can they to be good students? Having a part-time job just like a lesson which you can take if you are full of energy, but it is not important for college students. It can teach you something you can't learn from our books, but it can also fill your heart with something like anger, hatred and so on. To early to have a job, even a part-time job, has no good for a student. Even most college students has been adult, they are too young to have a real job. To make a long story short, I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
