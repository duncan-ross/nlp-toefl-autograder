Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Aside from the leading cause of death, it is also a source of a very foul and unpleasant smell. Today, even at schools, people are smoking and it is really disgusting. Some students think that smoking is cool but in reality, smoking isn't cool and in fact, it is very uncool and very disturbing. Our government should initiate the campaign to ban smoking at all restaurants, because aside from its very unpleasant smell, it is also very dangerous to our health. It is also a sign of negligence and disrespect to your neighbors, as not all people around you are smokers and thus some of them might be disturb and feel sick due to the smell. For me, smoking shouldn't only be banned at restaurants in the country but also, all the establishments as well. If you want to smoke then smoke at your own place, but not on a public establishment as it may affect other people around you. People know that smoking is bad to their health but why do they still do it? Some say that it gives a great relief to their problems while others started smoking due to their curiosity. But this has to be changed, smoking shouldn't be consider as an option to stress because it will not solve problems but rather add a lot of them such as lung sickness and other health hazards. In conclusion, by banning smoking at restaurants and establishment smokers will have less chance to smoke and kill themselves at the public. If this rule will be properly implemented, our government will not just save the health of the non-smokers but also, the lives of the smokers.
