Smoking in public not only harms smokers' health but also affect people around you. Even the smoker didn't mean to do that, the truth is that you interrupt others freedom to choose not to smell. Actually, it's a selfish and barbarian behavior to force others to smell the smoking they do not want to smell. People who do not like smokers has the reason for it's smelly and do damage to health in long time. However, few people have the courage to stop smoker in public. They either fear the smoker may refuse their asking or they just do not like to involve in a quarrel. Most people are too timid to call for their right. Therefore, there is a need to set a law or rule to protect their health right. Especially in a restaurant or cafe, some smokers are used to smoke after a meal. For them, It's a natural act to smoke, they didn't think too much about others feeling. In my opinion, I support smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nations should use coercive power to stop smokers from smoking at will in open area. It's inevitable to ban smoking at restaurant for health and safe in society.
