Nobody forces smokers to smoke and nobody forces non smokers not to smoke, It is a personal choice for both as is which restaurant they will got to, smoking or non-smoking. The non-smoker must take some responsibility for going to a smoking restaurant in the first place. Even so, everybody should be able to go to a restaurant without having to eat dinner with a face full of smoke that may at some stage, kill them if they do it for long enough. In order to create a safe environment for all, the Japanese government needs to introduce and police smoking bans in restaurants throughout Japan. Since there can be no question that nicotine and the other chemicals are deadly to humans, then the only intelligent thing to do is remove the cigarettes from the equation which means that a smoking ban must be implemented and all smokers should undergo education seminars which give graphic displays of dead smoking victims. It is hoped that the shock value of reviewing these graphic displays would motivate the smokers to stop smoking. This has had limited success in other countries but if it helps encourage one person to stop smoking then one day, there may never be a need for smoking bans.
