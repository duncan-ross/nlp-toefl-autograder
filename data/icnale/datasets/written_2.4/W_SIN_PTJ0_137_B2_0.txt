I disagree to the statement given in Topic A. College students have busy schedules that make it difficult for them to maintain a part-time job while pursuing their education. Apart from attending daily lessons, students have to juggle between completing assignments within deadlines and preparing for frequent tests. Having a part-time job will divert students' attention away from school work and reduces the time available for students to revise their work. Furthermore, students working part-time will suffer from fatigue from their work. Since the main priority of students should be focused on excelling in school work, having a part-time job is not important as it could adversely affect the academic performance of students in school. Nevertheless, some may argue that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to become more independent and mature individuals through handling the high levels of stress arising from balancing commitment between the part-time job and studies. However, one should note that college students can learn to be more independent and mature through their school commitments. Many students are actively involved in non-academic work in school that provides opportunities for them to grow as an individual. For instance, many students participate in activities organised by student clubs and societies. This allows students to widen their social circles, manage work-life balance and even assume leadership roles occasionally. Hence, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job given the busy schedules of students and their ability to achieve well-rounded development through other school activities.
