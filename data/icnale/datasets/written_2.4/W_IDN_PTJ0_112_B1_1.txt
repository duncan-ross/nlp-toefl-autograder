Many people have reasons about that. Some of them to say yes and other people to say no. Each of them certainly have a reason why they say like that. They say yes because they think, that is important to make the college students get independent and they can help their parents. But some of them to say no. Because they think, if a college students get job so, that job will annoy concentrate their taks in the college. I'am a college student in one of famous university in Surabaya. I have reason myself. I think a college student to have a part time job is ok. But, they must be able to manage their time between lecture and job efficiently. If they can't do it so, I think they more better don't do it. Because that can unless for their self. Such as, they are over concentrate with their job and their task in college are forgot. And than, when they have problem with their lecture. They will be concentrate to repair with their tasks in the college and their job become forgot. That happen will be happened like thet again and again. Because they can't manage their time efficiently. So, the conclusion about that is important or no up to their how they can manage their time. If they feel important to have a part time job, they can get it. But if they can't do it so, they more better only to concentrate with their college.
