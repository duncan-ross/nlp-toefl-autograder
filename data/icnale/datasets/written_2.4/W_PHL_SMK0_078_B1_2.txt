Smoking is bad to our health. It causes lung cancer and other kind of sickness that we can get from smoking. Many cases also are also from smoking that at early age they are starting smoking and dying also early. We have this mentality also that if we know someone is smoking we are telling that this person's life is short because of how he abuses his body with smoking. Banning the smoking in all restaurants in the country may help one person refrain from smoking. The smoke of the cigarette affects also the people around the person smoking. It can cause also some sickness to the person who inhaled the smoke. Being banned in the restaurants can minimal these cases. Somehow, it also helps our environment healthier. It will make the ambiance inside the restaurant greater. It will encourage more customers to eat in a particular restaurant. It makes healthier place to be in and enjoying the stay without any bad smell of the smoke of the cigarette. I do agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because I hate the smell of it and I know it's not good for me. I hope also that smoking should minimize in our country or maybe should be gone in our daily living so we can have a healthier life.
