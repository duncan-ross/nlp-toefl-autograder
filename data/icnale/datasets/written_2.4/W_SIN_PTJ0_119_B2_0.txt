In this day and age when self-sufficiency and independence are amongst some of the most sought after characteristics in a person, be it in University or in the workplace, it is no surprise that many college students have begun honing these traits with the means of a part-time job. Amongst many other reasons, students can benefit from becoming self-sufficient as they take on part-time jobs and earn their own keep. Many students opt to take on part time tutoring assignments while schooling so as to have a steady stream of income apart from their monthly allowances. In fact, some feel they can derive greater satisfaction from spending income generated by themselves. Such occurrences are also common in low-income families in order to ease the financial burden on their parents. Taking up a part-time job while in college allows students a fresh glimpse, albeit limited, into the clockwork of the working society. It also prepares them for the next phase in their lives after graduation by smoothing the transition between studying and working. Having prior work experience ensures that students are not completely foreign to the working world and would be able to adjust better. Having a part-time job while in college also ensures that students are able to gain important hands-on experience which they could later use to differentiate themselves from other potential job candidates; it gives them an edge over those who have no prior experience as employment surveys have shown that employers prefer hiring people who know what they are doing. Despite the vast number of benefits that are attached to pursuing a part-time job while in college, it can instead become a detriment if students cannot manage their time well. As such, a part-time job is only beneficial if it does not compromise academic and social commitments.
