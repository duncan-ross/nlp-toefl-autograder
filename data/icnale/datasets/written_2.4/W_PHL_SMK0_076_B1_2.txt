Smoking has always been in the midst of our society since time immemorial: from the small-scale tobacco productions during early times to large-scale cigarette productions at present. It is evident that nowadays, a huge part of the population – in the Philippines and in other countries – smoke. In my opinion, so long that it is controlled, smoking is fine. Many people I know are smokers, and I have seen what effects it holds against abusers. For me, I do not think that cigarette smoking should be banned at all. It is us who suffer the implications it brings about, but it is also us – not our family, friends, government or anybody else – who should learn to control our inhibitions. Even though I am against smoking, I don't see why it should be banned in restaurants. It is a matter of free will, and I don't think that we should alienate people the rights or at least the privilege to enjoy a puff after their favorite meal or alongside their favorite beverage. So as non-smokers are less likely to protest regarding the matter, it should be mandatory not for restaurants to ban smoking, but to provide a segregated area in the restaurant where smoking is allowed.
