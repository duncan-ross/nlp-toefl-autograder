 There is no denying that there are so many people smoking around us. As is known to everyone, there is enormous harm lying in smoking. For instance, smoking can bring severe harm to the smokers' lungs. But the fact is that people still continue to smoke. Almost all of the smokers began to smoke out of curiosity. After a period of time, they got addicted to it. And then, they found it quite difficult to get rid of the habit of smoking even though they had already been aware of the damage brought by smoking. The reason is obvious. They have anaclisis and they can't live without cigarette. Our urgent affair is to find some measures to help the smokers to quit smoking under the circumstance. Firstly, we should try our best to propagandize the harm to smokers and people around brought by smoking. In this way, we can help them build their determination and confidence of abandoning smoking successfully. And then, we can supervise and urge our family members. My father had ever been addicted to smoking. It's my mother, my sisters and me that urged him to quit smoking every day. The result was perfect. Now my father will never have a smoke. Lastly, we can find some succedaneum for them so that they can quit smoking more easily.
