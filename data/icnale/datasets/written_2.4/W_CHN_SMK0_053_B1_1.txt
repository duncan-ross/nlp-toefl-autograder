Sit in the elegant and clean restaurant, listen to some soft music, enjoy your yummy food, but what about some smoke in addition? Absolutely it is terrible! Smoking may let eaters who don't take cigarette choke. Let alone its harm to their bodies. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And the reasons why smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants may be listed as followings. To begin with, smoking can disturb the harmonious atmosphere. Imagine, in some high-level restaurant, some people are happily enjoying their dinners. Suddenly they smell the fog of smokers from nearby, they will immediately feel uncomfortable and cover their nose and mouth. Sometimes, if there are babies sit close to smokers, it is more terrible.

Let alone to the children. And many restaurants are often filled with the young, so it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants for young people health. To sum up, it is harmful for consumers in the restaurants to suffer second-hand smoking. And smoking in the restaurants should be banned without any doubts.
