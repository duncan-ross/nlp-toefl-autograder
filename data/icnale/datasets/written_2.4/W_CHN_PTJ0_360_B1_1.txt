Many students now have part-time jobs to earn some money. Some of them wash dishes at restaurants. Some teach children on weekends. They all do jobs in their spare time to earn money. On the one hand, they can really live better with more money. On the other hand, they don't have enough time to study. So part-time job is not necessary for a student. Students need time to study, but part-time jobs take over their spare time. Study is the most important job for a student, so one cannot give up time which should be spent in studying. If a student do part-time job, he will lose more than what he earns. Part-time jobs are not safe enough for students. Compared with other places, campus is the safest place for students. Students do have to get out of their campus to do their jobs. This means they may be hit by cars or stolen. All dangerous things may happen to students. Some students may have financial problems and they may take part-time jobs to solve this. But they should consider this problem once more. Is part-time job the best answer? No! It will never be the best answer. They should chose study and safety instead of money.
