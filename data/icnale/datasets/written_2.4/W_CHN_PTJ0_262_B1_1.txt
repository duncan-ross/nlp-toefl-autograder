 From my viewpoint, this topic is quite reasonable. As a college student, it is important for he or she to learn the knowledge and skills which usually taught in the society. Though our university provides some access to take part in various activities, making us get to know something different in everyday learning, it is proved to be far from enough. For example, we often hear the news like that lots of graduates cannot find the proper job because of lacking experience or having a wrong attitude towards work. Suppose a graduate had taken a part-time job before, he or she will be much more competitive definitely. Secondly, once a college student takes a part-time job, it often forces he or she to be more independent. In this era, students depend a lot on their parents. However, colleges are usually regarded as proper places to improve the ability of independence, in that way, a part-time job may help a student to be independent in finance. I have to acknowledge a problem doubt by many people that taking a part-time will hog a lot of time used for studying, however, as a college student, I can responsibility say that one student in the college absolutely can spare enough time for working. In a word, taking a part-job in college will greatly help a student in many aspects.
