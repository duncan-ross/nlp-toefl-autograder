First of all, I am not a smoker. Hence I would agree to this statement with a certain degree of biasness. To have a fairer view, I will state down the facts of smoking and harmful effects it causes. What everyone knows is that smoking causes lung cancer. It is the particles released from the cigarette that damages the cells inside those lungs. And since it is the particle being release, not only the smoker will have chances of getting lung cancer; the by-passer will have chances getting it, too. Smoking is polluting the air, too. To the non-smokers they might have difficulty in breathing when they share the same atmosphere with the smokers. How can the non-smokers now enjoy their food when they are having trouble breathing? Critics may say that the restaurants can split up into two spaces; the smoking and non-smoking area. Though it may seem as a good idea, it may have its downside. Think of it this way; smokers can sit in both the smoking area and the non-smoking area whereas non-smokers can only sit inside the non-smoking region to feel "comfortable". This may shun non-smokers away when the restaurant ran out of sits in the non-smoking area while the smoking area is barely full. Wouldn't this ultimately affect the restaurant's business? Hence I would say, smoking should not be encouraged in restaurant for the sake of health and wealth.
