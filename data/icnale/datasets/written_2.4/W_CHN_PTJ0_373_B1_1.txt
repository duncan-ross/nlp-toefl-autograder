 Nowadays, more and more graduated college students can't find satisfing jobs. There are many reasons for this. For example, they can't use their knowledge well and they have no idea about the economic situation. But the main point is that they lack the experiences about the society. So I think college students should do some part-time jobs. Life for a full-time college student isn't busy. They have much free time. Many students spend their leisure time in playing computer games or sleeping. This is a bad idea. Why not do a part-time job? It can not only supply some economic support but also provide some knowledge and experiences. The second advantage is really important. Most colleges or universities are open to the public, but the life in college is different to social life. Doing part-time jobs means that you can have a look at the social life and have more chances to learn social skills. When you graduate from college, you will find them so important to find a job and live a good life. For part-time jobs, it doesn't matter how much you can earn. The key point is how much you can learn. We can't learn everything in school. In my opinion, doing part-time jobs is a way of study. And the knowledge involved is even more important. So I think college students should do part-time job.
