 Nowadays, more and more university students start to do a part-time job. Should we do a part-time job in our university life? People have a discussion about this phenomenon. Is it important for university students to do a part-time job? In my opinion, this point is right, because doing a part-time job has some benefits. First, I think in the university we learned things which is just about our profession. So it is very narrow. We should learn other knowledge from doing a part-time job. Second, they can get some cash, they can not ask to their parents for money. This way can solve some economical problems. Thirdly, in a survey about what can you describe about you university life? 60% students said they did not know what should they do, they had many time but they did nothing once. They wasted a lot of time. So they could do a part-time job so that they can level up the experience. We are in great times, then we must do something in order to become a real person in the society. Besides, in our future life we can know about the advantages. So it is a good choose to do a part-time job.
