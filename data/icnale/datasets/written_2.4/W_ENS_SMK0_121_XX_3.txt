I agree that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan. It seems like a drastic measure, but I base my statement on the reasons I set out below. The first is that there are too many inconsiderate smokers in Japan. Just because a restaurant has no ban on smoking, it should not mean that smokers should disregard those around them. I have been in restaurants where people on the table next to me light up after each course that they finish. They may have a right to smoke, but I also have a right to enjoy my meal and actually taste it. Which brings me to my second reason: no self-respecting chef should allow their culinary creations to be ruined by cigarette smoke. Most sushi restaurants do not allow smoking (or it is an unwritten rule). Perhaps this can be extended to encompass all restaurants that want their customers to enjoy the food as it should be tasted. The final reason why I think smoking should be banned is that the attempts to separate smokers and non-smokers in restaurants in Japan are completely useless. There may be some low wall or an exhaust fan, but these do not constitute a truly separated dining environment. It is unfortunate that we need to talk about banning things that should really be self-regulating, things that should be controlled by a feeling of decency and respect towards our fellow citizens (and diners). Regrettably, however, relying on the common sense and decency of many (not all) smokers to not light up in restaurants is not enough. As a final note, I am ambivalent towards smoking in bars. We usually go to restaurants for the food; we go to bars, however, for the atmosphere. I am in two minds about banning smoking from bars!
