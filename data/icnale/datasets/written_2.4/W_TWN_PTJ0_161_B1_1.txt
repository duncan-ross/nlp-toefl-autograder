What would college students do during long summer vacation? Some students stay at home watching TV shows and playing on-line games around the clock. Others go to cram school for reinforcement of their schoolwork. The others take part-time jobs. Some people might think that students who take part time job suffering from materialization. However, I think that taking part-time job can not only broaden our personal relationships but also let us get more society experience. In my college, there are even a lot of projects that we can take part time jobs in some famous company, such as TSMC and UMC. Students can learn some useful techniques and know more about what they might do and get if they want to work in those company. Moreover, by taking part time job, students earn their own money and learn to manage it by theirselves. Besides, they might cherish it because they get it by theirselves. I think that it's more effective to have good notions of money by actual experience than learning on textbooks. Although taking part time job is a good way of learning a lot of experiences and there are truly a lot of goodness. We should know the drawbacks of taking part time job at the same time. As a college student, learning is still our main work. We still have to use a lot of time on learning. After all, our future work depends mainly on what we learn at college. Having a good balance between part time job and schoolwork is very vital for all of us.
