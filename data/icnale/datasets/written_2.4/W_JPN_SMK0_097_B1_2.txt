I don't like smoking so that I agree with that idea. Because it is not good for humans health or earth environment to smoke tobacco. Most of the people think it is ok because the seats where people can smoke separate from the seats where people cannot smoke in many Japanese restaurants. But some who hate smoking think it is not ok to someone smoking in the same building. Moreover, the effects of separating seats are said to be not useful. Because there are many restaurants where banned smoking at all the seats and continue to increase like that restaurants now so I'm very happy. But there are many routinely smoking people who usually don't know feelings of people hate smoking. In addition, when they smoking, they often don't aware what the people around them think. Also the Japanese tobacco's price is much cheaper than any other countries. If be completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country, the smoker couldn't smoothly be adapt that situation or the restaurants must get low earnings than ever. Meanwhile, the people who don't smoke or come with their children or pregnant can come to the restaurants with great relief. For that reason, I think Japanese restaurants gradually should be completely banned smoking.
