 Above all, I have the belief that there is no doubt that smoking in public places should be forbidden without being tolerated. I have these enough reasons to support this view. First, as everybody knows, smoking is not only harmful to your health but also is harmful to others' health because smoking will make your lung be hurted and even increase the risk of you and the person surrounding with you including to recent surveys. In addition, what makes people unaccepted is that them did't smoke while they have to undertake the bad consequence of smoking through others' doing. So, we can understand that smoking may lead to others' unpleasure while them are talking or walking. You know, the smell of smoking is not always being liked by all the person. For example, if you smoke in a crowd carriage many passengers will be angry at looking at you. On the other hand, no smoking in public places I think is a kind of gentlemen's behaviour because of your knowing to respect the feeling of the public. In the last, if we want to breath fresh air in outdoor, we shouldn't allow smoking in public places. After all, smoking is able to and also should be in the area which is open for smoker especially.
