It is an issue that smoking should be completely banned or allowed at all the restaurants in the country. Some people think that it takes away smoker's freedom to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country, but I disagree with the point of view. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are tree reasons. Firstly, it makes the place unsanitary to smoking at the restaurants. It smoking at the restaurants is allowed, it will be dirty on the table or floor because cigarette butt or ash drops here and there. Then, we should have dinner in dirty condition. Secondly, smoking at the restaurants brings on danger. For example, if smoker does not put out a cigarette, a fire can take place at the restaurants. In addition, if children touch the light of a cigarette, they can get burnt in the hand. Also, despite dropping cigarette ash on the dishes, people can eat the food by mistake. As a result, people may have a stomachache or catch a disease. Thirdly, smoking at the restaurant makes other uneasy. If smoking is allow at the restaurants, the space will be full of smoke and it can make eyes and throat sore. Smoke will bother people who want to enjoy and relax their time at the restaurants and people visiting with family will also feel unpleasant due to smoke. For these reasons, I think smoking should be forbid at all the restaurants in the country.
