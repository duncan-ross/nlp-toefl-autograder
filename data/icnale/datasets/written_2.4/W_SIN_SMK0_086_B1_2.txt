I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. By restaurants, I am referring to proper dining areas, and not places of entertainment like pubs. I would also like to extend the definition of restaurants to include non-air conditioned dining areas such as hawker centres. We are all aware of the harmful effects of third-party smoke, as well as the irritation it brings to non-smokers. Obviously, the negative effects far outweigh any marginal financial gains, if any, restaurant owners can possibly gain. Firstly, why is there a need for smoking areas to be established in dining areas anyway? Dining areas, as the name implies, are for dining. We cannot eat and smoke simultaneously. Even if someone is not dining in the restaurant, he could always excuse himself and go somewhere else for a puff. The urge to smoke can obviously be controlled. It is not as if he would suffer tremendously to take five minutes to go somewhere else to smoke. Furthermore, what is the use of a smoking area if the smoke can diffuse to non-smoking areas? Unless the area is totally blocked and cordoned off, it is totally useless to create such a space. However, the smoke will most likely affect the other diners, such as when people enter the smoking area, the smoke diffuses out. If it is far from the main dining area, then there is no need for the creation of it in the first place. Smokers may have the freedom to smoke, but non-smokers have their right to dine in a pleasant environment with clear air, especially since they are paying for it. Smokers can just smoke somewhere else, but diners have no other similar alternatives.
