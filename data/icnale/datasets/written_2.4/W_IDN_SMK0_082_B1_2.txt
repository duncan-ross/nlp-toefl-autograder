It is true that smoking is being a habit for many people nowadays. Men, women, old people, teens, executives, suburban, and even a 4-year-boy (as seen on TV / newspaper few time ago) are enjoy to smoking. People who do smoking called active smokers. They breathe about 20% of smoke that they produce when smoking. Passive smokers, the people who do not smoking and be around the active smoker, breathe 80% of smoke that active smokers produce. Smoking is bad for us. I am not just talking about health. We already knew that smoking can cause many disease such as cancer, impotency, and also bad for pregnancy. In my opinion, smoking is just like burning your money. You buy cigarettes and burn it for nothing. Smoking is also wasting time. Well, I admitted that not all people like to do nothing but smoking to spend their time, but this habit is also popular. Some of them do their activity while smoking. This is also not good since they can affect passive smokers around them. Restaurant is one of popular public places. Nice place to spend time with family and friend. It will be many people there. Imagine if there are smoke around you while you talking, eating, and enjoying your beverages. Breathing such poisoned smoke while you wanted to relax. It is just uncomfortable and bad for many people health. In conclusion, I agreed that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. For many reasons, smoking may be good for the smokers themselves, but more reasons about smoking's side effect should make us realize that smoking is a bad habit.
