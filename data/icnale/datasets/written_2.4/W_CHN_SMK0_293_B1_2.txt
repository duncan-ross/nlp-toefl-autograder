Introduced more than one hundred years before, tobacco is playing a more and more important role in people's life than ever before. And now in the modern society, they just seem to be everywhere. A group of people even should smoke in the public place, which I can never ever tolerate. I do hate people smoke in public, because I can not stand the terrible smell. I believe the majority of the non-smokers are the same with me. Those who smoke in the public place don't care about the feelings of the people around them. To that extent, they are not considerate and even uncivilized! I don't think they have the right to put us in the dirty air, which is tatally not fair to us. What's more? The smoke is poisonous. Hundreds of thousands of scientific findings have already showed that the cigarettes contain much harmful substances to human body. We, people who do not smoke, are innocent, when some people tend to have a good time at the cost of the health of the people standby, aren't we? To be critical, they are murdering. In addition, as civilized citizens, they should at least obey the rules and regulations in a certain place. In many public places, there are obvious signs read No smoking. But they just ignore. It's a shame, isn't it. To sum up, from my stand point, smoking in public should be banned strictly. I appeal to all the non-smokers to stand out, make their voice and fight for the rights of us own, the rights to live in the clean healthy air.
