I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I also have a part-time job in my college life. I be a tutor, this is a very challenged job. College is a period to build up one's independence. There are many college students leaving their home land, living with classmates first time. They can't rely on parents anymore, so they have to create more experience about how to communicate with someone you don't know him or her very well. Talking to different people can learn many speak a skill, which is useful to our future. When we have a part-time job, we must use time well. Because we not only spend time studying but also working. How to distribute 24 hours in a day is an important work that we must learn it. After we graduate from college, some people choose to go to a research institute, some people choose to work. If we have a part-time job experience in college life, that can help we do better in work. No matter what career we choose in the future, we have to enhance our ability. Having a part-time job not only get more money to buy something we like or need, but make friends with more people.
