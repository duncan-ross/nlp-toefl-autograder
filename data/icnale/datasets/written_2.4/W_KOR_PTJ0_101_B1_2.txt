Expensive prices like these days in the era of good jobs for students part-time job is considered to be one. Tuition is expensive. So I work part-time job. But the seniors said that if you study more hard, then you would get a scholarship. But the coming generations dislike that. Sometimes Parents give spending money to me but Parents abilities are limited. Therefore it has difficult to receive money. Because part-time job is help a little. However part-time job is very hard. So majority lack of sleep. It combines a study and a part-time-job has a bad influence at a school record Therefore the students choose a part-time job cautiously. Many people have to have a part- time job for my tuition. Many adults, however, feel these after-school jobs demand too much time and pull teens away from more important obligations, including school and family. So, I wish I benefit from the variety of schools. Then I hope cut fees. Is helpful to many students and parents. But I think accumulating a variety of experiences while you're still young, helps you in whatever you choose to do later in life. You should think carefully before making a decision. Thank you.
