Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Till now, smoking has already become a significant issue in the country. If you roam on the street, you will find in surprise that nearly half of the citizens are used to smoking in public, even youngsters are among them. Hitherto, smoking have grabbed billions of money from one generation and murdered hundreds of thousands of people. Now, the Pluto turns to the younger generation, the teenagers. As a result, many professors hope government to pass proper laws to ban smoking in public places, especially at the restaurants. In my opinion, banning smoking at all the restaurants is essential. Since smoking may not only do harm to the smokers, but also influence partners' health. What's more, when person is eating, one is sitting in one place and not moving. With the limited space at the restaurants, smoking can greatly damage another's body. To some degree, if a person enjoying supper with smoking smog around, he or she is supposed to lose several days life. This is a sobering fact, while the most of citizens are blind to the truth. Smokers are enjoying the cigarettes, while others are enjoying dinner in the killing smog. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, for our later generations don't leave more time for us.
