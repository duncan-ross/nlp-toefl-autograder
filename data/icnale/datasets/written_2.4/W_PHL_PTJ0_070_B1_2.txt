Teenagers today tend to always buy anything they want from clothes up to different gadgets. As part of the increasing number of the college students in our country, I feel somehow guilty when I ask my parents to buy something for me even though they are already spending for my education at the same time buying all the things I want. That's why having a part time job as a college student can help not only you but also your parents as well. Have you ever felt how it feels to buy something using your own savings from your allowances? Even though, it is natural for us Filipinos to support our children even if they are not anymore kids. Not like kids in the US, that when out of High School, they are considered as an independent individual. Having a part time job can really boost your self-confidence at the same time help support our parents. For me, every time I get to spend my savings on clothes and shoes, I feel excited to use them because knowing that it came from my savings is a great feeling. As I had seen in one of the articles I found in the Internet before, McDonalds today are encouraged to hire students during the summer so that somehow they could have an allowance even though it is summer time. Part time jobs is important for people who financially unstable. But even though they are the people who mostly need these jobs, I am still encouraging many of us students of De La Salle to enrol in these part time jobs and start helping our parents financially.
