Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with that statement, because smoking is the bad activity. Smoking in the restaurant will disturb the comfort of all the visitors. Actually, smoking is a bad habit. Because inside of cigarette there are many toxic materials which is can give the health problem. Beside that, smoke of cigarette is also dangerous. In restaurant, if there are person that smoking, certainly the smoke from his cigarette will inhale by another person. And actually, passive smoker is very danger than active smoker. Because inside smoke of cigarette, contain more dangerous toxic material than cigarette. Passive smoker is a person that inhale the smoke of cigarette, and active smoker is a person that smoking. But passive or active smoker, both of it can give the bad effect for body. Negative effect from smoking such as cancer, impotence, heart disease, respiratory disease, digestive disease, bad effect for pregnancy, and many more. If the people want to smoke in restaurant, the restaurant should to make a room that use for people who want to smoke, so as not to disturb the comfort of visitors who do not smoke.
