I agree with part-time job. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job to help the living parts are different. Part-time job to help you a lot of social life and living allowance for the money and the future is also very helpful. If part-time job during the break to earn pocket money, parents are relieved of the burden. Another part-time job related to my future career and also increases your skill in this matter will be able to do better. I have done part-time job. Will be able to understand the feelings of parents do. Although the body feels tired and difficult, but proud and fulfilled. And worked hard, who will spend the money and one more thought. Learn the importance of money. Part time jobs will meet many people. These people can be friends in the new environment. When you have experienced many things difficult do not give up easily, without frustration. Part-time job, yet never experienced, would like to recommend to anyone. Now I'm busy in school part-time job does. Every vacation is a family might be wise to help. The part-time job for the summer vacation, I try to good challenge!
