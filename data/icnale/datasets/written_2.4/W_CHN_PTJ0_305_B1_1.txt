One of the differences of college and middle school is the high fees. That means some of us may try to make money their own during college. But is it necessary? I think teenagers as we are don't have the ability to differ bad eggs from the goods. What's more, part-time jobs may take away our study times and drive away our attention. That may not worth the candle. So I think part-time job isn't necessary for college students. I have ever seen a story on newspaper which shows disadvantages about part-time jobs. Xiaoming was once a hard-working boy who always buries himself into study. But when he tried part-time jobs for just once, he saw the great economical receipts from it. He got off of class more and more frequently to do part-time jobs, so he can get much money which makes his life in college more satisfying. At the same time, his performance on class was worse and he also had less attendances. So when the final tests coming, he couldn't figure it out as well as he once could. And get a low score more than he could ever think. According to Xiaoming's sorrow story, we should know that even through money is important; it is not everything we should run after during the precious college time. There are other significant things we could do, too. Moreover, our college students are not mature somehow, and it can't be avoided to be treated by some experienced ones, some of whom may not be kind, too. So it may not be safe, if we take part-time jobs without enough cautious. All in all, I think it is not necessary to do part-time jobs for college students. For we should grab the opportunities to study hard, for we can take part-time jobs when grow up, but it is not easy to have another teenage after old.
