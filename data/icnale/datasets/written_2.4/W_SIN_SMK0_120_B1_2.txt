I fully agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The negative consequences of smoking are now so pronounced in the entire country that almost everyone knows about them. Yet, inconsiderate people are still smoking and increasing the risk of mortality rate of themselves and to those around them. Studies have shown that cigarette smoke contain carcinogens --- substances which can lead to cancer. In restaurants, these carcinogens could attach themselves on the surrounding food, thereby further increasing the risk of cancer to those who are consuming them Besides that, in enclosed restaurants, cigarette smoke can cause the entire environment to be polluted with the putrid smell of it. This would also adversely affect the other non-smoking patrons' enjoyment of their food. Lastly, restaurants usually cater to people of different age groups. Young children and babies have increased risk of developing acute or chronic conditions from breathing in too much cigarette smoke as their immune system might not be fully developed yet. Furthermore, pregnant women are also at risk because the cigarette smoke could affect the foetus in the womb. With all the negative externalities brought about by smoking, smoking should definitely be banned at all restaurants in the country. In fact, I would further advocate for smoking to be banned at all places in the country, except for several smoking points where smoking is allowed. There are many high-risk activities such as mountain climbing which have a greater mortality rate than smoking. However, smoking increases the mortality rate of others and not just the user or doer. As a result, it is unfair to the innocent non-smoking bystanders, and smoking should be banned.
