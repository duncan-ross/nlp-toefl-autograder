 As we can see, many college students do take a part-time job or more, but the others do not. It seems to be related to a question--Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? While in my opinion, it depends. Suppose you are a student who can deal with your school work easily so that you get a large sum of free time. It surely is important for you to have a part-time job, reasons are followed. First of all, it helps you cultivate independence as you can distribute your time maturely. And then, you can relieve, to some extent, the economic burdens of your parents if you do have part-time jobs. What's more, you will learn more social abilities than others who never take. All in all, it is important for students who have spare effort to take a part-time job. Suppose you are a student who can't get through your school work smoothly. It is not a good idea to take a part-time job and it is not important and even harmful for you at all. The main reason is that it distracts your attention from your studies, which adds fuel to the fire. So that you may feel terribly hurry or even upset when you fail to pass exams, which beat your confidence and lead to a vicious circle. What's more, your early contact with society adds greatly to the worries of your parents. In a whole, it truly depends whether it is important for college students to take part-time jobs.
