Nowadays, more and more college students choose to do a part-time job which receives lots of public attention. An argument about whether college students should do it has been involved in many talks among teachers, parents and some educational institutions. And as far as I am concerned, in spite of some particular examples, there are some benefits college students can earn when doing a part-time job. As to students themselves, it is a necessary challenge that college students should meet to do more practice in the real society, to sharp our abilities in the fierce competition, and to acquire more experience in the comparison with others. All of these may finally attach great importance to our future success whenever looking for our career or applying for further study. Besides, compared with high school students, college students would have more spare time. There are always some students addicted to computer games who are surely able to choose a part-time job which will get more benefits. And as to the society, the participation of college students may bring in lively factors to the force market. The passion and energy that college students show will force others to be more active which may eventually promote the producing efficiency. And what's more, the pay of college students is much lower which means the company will save more costs and at the same time bring more profits. Since there are so many benefits, why not find a part-time job right now? Carried with courage, confidence and passion, we should catch the opportunity to take a training lesson. Don't hesitate and just do it. Although some difficulties may block your way, that's where the treasure hides.
