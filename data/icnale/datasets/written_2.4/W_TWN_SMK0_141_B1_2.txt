Speaking of the problem of smoking, I wasn't truly bothered by the secondhand smoke when I was a child. Because my father used to smoke inside the house, when I smell someone smoking around me outdoors, I can stand it. However, as I grow up, I have known that what secondhand smoke could hurt innocent people who don't smoke and surroundings as well. I started to hate selfish smokers, including my father. Then, the new policy was declear. Nobody was allowed to smoke indoors. Until this period, I can breathe in the air without strange smell, I realize I agree with this policy. However, on the one hand, some smokers said that their human rights were taken. They don't like the boundaries about where to smoke. What's more, the businessmen hate this policy, too. With the limitation, people who tried not to get the bill because of against the rule, they choose quit smoking, and that cause the sales down. On the other hand, the crowed who don't smoke think they were protected. The nightmares about those annoying smell has gone in certain places, such as restaurant. In my opinion, it is a good decision to banned smoking at restaurants, even though there some dissatisfied sounds from some group. To think in a vision way, if this policy can lead to the decrease of number of smoke people, it is their health that being blessed.
