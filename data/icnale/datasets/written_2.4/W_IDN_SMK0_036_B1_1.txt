Today, many restaurants started to limit smoking. Some of them give special area, but some of them completely banned. I think, smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants because of some reason. First, customer is our king. We must serve them and give them what they needed include smoking. In some case, non smoking customer disturbed when the restaurant full of smoke. However, it can be solved with adding non smoking area. Second, it prevent restaurant to lose their customer. When the restaurant banned it, it may have chance the smoking customer will leave your restaurant. The felt not comfortable, and they prefer not to eat in your restaurant again. At last, Indonesia is smoker country. It will not wise if you banned smoking completely. When you did that, it might has chance, your restaurant did not have customers. Most of men in Indonesia have smoking habit, and when they want to eat together with their family, they will not choose your restaurant because your restaurant did not have that facility. Also the smokers pay taxes for the cigarettes they smoke and the government needs the money to build the country. In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned. People who want to smoke should do so in the smoking room.
