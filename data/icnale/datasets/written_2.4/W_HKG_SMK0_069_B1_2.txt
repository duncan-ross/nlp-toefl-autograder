I know many friends who smoke frequently in their daily life. So if it is asked that whether smoking should be banned in all restaurants, I will not disagree with that. Smokers should have their rights to smoke in most of the places, and at least restaurant is one of those places. If someone argues that smoking will harm the health of the other people who are in the same restaurant, I think the set up of smoking and non-smoking areas can already solve the problem. Even though it may be difficult for some of the restaurants like fast food shop to set up the smoking area, smoking should not be banned in all the other restaurants. I know that the policy is aimed to taking care of the smokers by decreasing the time of smoking; this may not be practically useful since the smokers will smoke in the other places in the restaurant like toilet or just outside the restaurants. In this way, the situations remain the same and the other people are affected. Air pollution may be made more serious as well.
