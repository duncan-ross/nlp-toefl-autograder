I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all air-conditioned restaurants in the country, but made optional for non-air-conditioned ones. Smoking has adverse health effects on both the smoker and the people surrounding the smoker. The third-hand smoke can be equally, if not more, deadly. This is especially worse in an air-conditioned restaurant as the smoke can be transmitted more readily. Considering the negative health consequences, it is only ethical to have a smoking ban imposed so as to protect the non-smokers, especially young children and the elderly. It is important for a complete ban because if the ban is partial, some air-conditioned restaurants may feel compelled to allow smoking in their bid to increase the number of smoking customers. This dilemma between earning more profits and protecting the health of non-smokers would not exist if a complete ban is imposed. However, for non-air-conditioned restaurants, a smoking ban should be optional. This is because the transmission of cigarette smoke is less serious when fresh air is available. Instead of a smoking ban, the restaurant owner can consider a partition or reserved area for smoking customers. In doing so, the owner will be able to maintain the welfare of the non-smokers while giving smokers the freedom to pursue their freedom. Another advantage of not imposing a ban in non-air-conditioned restaurants is that the government will not risk alienating smokers. If the ban applies to all restaurants, there is a high likelihood of this group feeling marginalised. This could result in protest behaviours, which can be dangerous to the economic and political stability and social fabric of the country.
