I agree with the following sentence: It is important for the college students to have a part-time job. I believe that working is definitely different from studying. What an eighteenth teenager need is no longer as same as a senior high school student. Entering a college means entering a new period of one's life. In college, it is absolutely necessary for everyone to dedicate to a specific academic realm. However, there must be other things as important as studying. Having a part-time job is a great chance to experience something different from school life. School is not the only place to learn. Professor is not the only one who gives knowledge, either. I'd like take two part-time jobs for example to show what students could enhance from such experiences. The first one is to be a tutor. A teacher and a student are opposite positions. Briefly speaking, a student absorbs knowledge; nevertheless, a teacher gives knowledge. Once you are a teacher, you may face lots of questions asked by students. Then, it pushes you to find answers. In the process of finding the answers, you start to learn this subject from different angles and probably explore something interesting and new. The other one is to be a counter in a convenience store. Servicing people is not easy. However you feel that day, you have to face customers with smile. I think it trains one's conduct of emotion. Besides, a counter should count the items on shelves every day. It takes one's patience. To sum up, a new social status, a valuable experience in your life. Having a part-time job is important for the college students. If students walk out of the campus, they will find how different it is and how much things waiting for them to learn.
