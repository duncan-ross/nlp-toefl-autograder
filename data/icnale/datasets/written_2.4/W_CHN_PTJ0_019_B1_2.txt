Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. Different people have different views on it: some think it is very useful and valuable for college students to have part-time jobs, others insist that part-time jobs are waste of time and bring more disadvantages than advantages to college students. In my opinion, everything divides into two, despite the problems that part-time job will bring to college students, it remains very important for us to have part-time jobs. The reasons for this are as follows:Firstly, part-time jobs provide opportunities for college students to connect with society. They will know the latest news and hot topics in talent market and be well-prepared for the future career. For example, if a college student works as an office clerk, he will know more about how to behave and what to do when they are facing a complicated situation in the work. Secondly, part-time job will bring some money to college students in return. As it is known to us, college tuition is not so low that every student can afford it. Part-time job's wages can save for the expense and reduce the financial burden on their parents. Last but not least, part-time job can develop the college students' sense of independence. At present, most Chinese families have only one child. The parents love their children and also spoil them. Many college students are single children. They are too dependent on their parents and their teachers and don't know how to live by themselves. Part-time job give them the chance to become independent. In a word, part-time job do a lot of good to college students and I support it!
