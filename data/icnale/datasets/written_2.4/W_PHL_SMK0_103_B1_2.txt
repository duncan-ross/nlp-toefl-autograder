What can be more wonderful than eliminating one of the reasons as to why we get deadly diseases? Smoking has been an activity that is abused by several people. It even makes me wonder if they even think about other people when they smoke. One of the evidences why I think smoking is being abused is that people can smoke almost anywhere. Aside from that, they also disregard the policies that exist to prevent them from smoking in a particular place. Can't they at least leave one, generally speaking, a place for me to relax properly? At the very least, leave restaurants alone! I may be exaggerating in expressing my prejudice towards people who smoke in restaurants, but seriously, there are various reasons for it. There are reasonable reasons as to why I think that smoking in restaurants are bad. First reason is that not all people in a restaurant have the same interests. What I mean to say is that not all people are fine with people smoking around them, taking me as an example. Smoking is wildly to known to cause more danger to the second-hand smokers or the ones who inhale the smoke from the cigarette. For that reason, there are people who are conscious about their health and it would be nice for people who smoke to think about those people. For goodness sake, respect their rights as a co-citizen of this world. Another reason is that not all restaurants are well ventilated. This will result into having the smoke enclosed in the restaurant's vicinity and will thus again result to the harm of other people. Seriously, smoking in public is already not good; it just makes smoking in restaurants a very bad idea.
