I agree because someone may defeated a cigarette like the smell of a cigarette because a cigarette has the smell wildly especially if it is in a dining-room or that restaurant is air-conditioner room makes a cigarette has the smell and make a bad atmosphere and people inside don't want the smell the smell and don't want to eat anymore. It is a good statement that all restaurants should ban the smoking but in practical it is hardly force people to not smoke in the restaurants. However, if the owners are very strict, it is possible to see non of people to smoke in the restaurants. For example, in many 2 or 3 starts restaurants don't allow people to smoke, and the customers follow the rules. But, if there are some customers who want to smoke while waiting for the food or while having alcohol, there is a place for smoking only or we call it as a smoking area. In hotel, nearly all of the restaurants separate places for smokers and non smokers to have food. For example, in the beach, the restaurants ask the customers whether they prefer to have non smoking room or smoking room. Then take the customer to the chosen places. It seems that all people happy to see that. If the restaurants cannot ban people because it's personal choice, they should separate who want or doesn't want to smoke.
