 Smoking is a kind of annoyed behavior in the eyes of the people who don't smoke. Why are people smoke? I think some people find tobacco can let him or her excited after smoking, Other people think smoking stands for cool and wealthy, there is an another reason, the people who was under the great pressure want to find a way to reduce it. However, Smoking is an unhealth behavior which bring a lot harmful not only smoker itself but other people stay nearby. When I smell the smoke I feels headache, so, I hate someone smokes besides me. I think there are lots of people feel strongly annoyed when someone smoking in public. Nowadays, many countries have set the law to prevent the rights of people who doesn't smoke. The law says no smoking in public, if you wants to smoke, you must be alone without anyone nearby or go to the smoking zoom. I think this law indicate that more and more people desire a clean environment. One more rules between human being is when you do something yourself you can't make trouble to other people, otherwise the society would turn into upset&down. Do not smoke in the public I think is important both to society and citizens, which could made great process to the civilization of human being.
