Stop and listen to a conversation in the bus or in the supermarket and time and time again you will hear about part-time job. It is important to have it or not important for college students. Nowadays you can see that some college students have a free time and don't have money to use. That is the one reason that they take a part time job for their own money to use. A part-time job have been known that can make college students have money and experience for get real work at their major have study. It's important that they can learn work before they graduated from university. And some companies want college students that have experience before to work with them that will make a college student wanted a part-time job. But I have opinion that they could do something better than part-time job if they don't need money for their own supplements. Because I saw some college students use money for find cruise such as some friends of mine. They use money to drink alcohol and go to pub or bar when their money gone out they might borrow money or go part-time job. That is bad I think they could use money for education or daily life. So how it is important for college students must have a part-time job. Yes, it is but it's not everyone that should have. It's for their own to determine that what shall they do in the future because you have a time for 4 years to decision that which way you want to walk along path?
