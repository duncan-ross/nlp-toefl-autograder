Smoking in any place, public places such as restaurants, malls, gas stations, or certain buildings there are actually rules that must be obeyed. Although there was no written or picture for smoking ban, we have to appreciate about all around us. Many restaurants that actually have unwritten rules not to smoke. Therefore, in many regions expect visitors to understand it. in addition to comfort those who are in the room, also there are things that can be dangerous. For example, material flammability in space, or people around who may be allergic to cigarette smoke. That's very disturbing comfort when eating at restaurants. Not to mention there are pregnant women, small children, or parents who did not hold the cigarette smoke. Besides not good for others, also in our own health. Start right cultural health of ourselves, keep clean by not throwing cigarette ends at any place you like because it is very likely to cause a fire. So life is a healthy beginning by reducing smoking. In order for our heart clean and healthy. Reduce periodic defects on the inside of our bodies and keep any content of our food. Since starting healthy habits that we make. Therefore I also support the idea of banning cigarette smoking at public places including the restaurant.
