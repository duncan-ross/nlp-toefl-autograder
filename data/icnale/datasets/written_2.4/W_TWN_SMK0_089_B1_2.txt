I do not agree with banning smoking in all restaurants within the country. I do agree, however, with banning smoking in all family restaurants within the country. The restaurants that I do not agree with banning smoking are restaurants such as pubs or clubs. There are two reasons why I agree with banning smoking and two reasons why I disagree with banning smoking. The reasons why I agree with banning smoking in general restaurants are as follow. First, I believe that smokers are causing inconveniences to others. Therefore, they should be the ones that do more work. By doing more work I simply mean walking out of the restaurant to smoke. Second, I believe that everyone has a right to protect their own health and the health of their children. Therefore, in a public place, such as a family restaurant, smoking should be banned country-wide. The reasons why I disagree with banning smoking in pubs and clubs are as follow. First, I sincerely believe that people chooses to be in places such as these. Hence, by choosing this area of entertainment, they most likely recognize it as a smoking area. Second, I believe that people who drinks and party until the sun comes up are not ones who should be pointing fingers at smokers. Therefore, it is most likely that they are not deeply concern with their health. Hence, smokers should be able share these two places as their entertainment areas as well.
