I think working part-time job for college students is a good thing. Because it will help their parents. May be a part, half, or all of their spend in whole semester. I think money that they receive from employer as much as full-time job, but it is one way to help their parents. When they working and find the money with themselves, it is a pride of themselves too. They know spending money, realize the money, sufficient, etc. Working while they are studying of college students are not only for get the money, but it is a find experience before they see the real work after graduate. People who have experience before this, they will solve the problem, have a planning, and ready to work in different situations that will happen in the future. The best way to find a part-time job should choose work that fit with yourself, fit with major that you have studied, or work that you like the most. If you like your job then you will work better than the work that you do not like. You will do very well. I agree with this topic because if I have a chance I want to work part-time job too. I think it can help our parents. May be a little, but I think I have a pride of myself if I can find amount of money.
