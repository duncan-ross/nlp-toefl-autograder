Now a day trends have changed study methods and the life style of the students have also changed. In older times parents can easily support their children while they were studying. They could afford their all study expenses as will as their other expenditures. But now a day it's very difficult for some of the parents to do so. So now students have started to do some part time jobs beside their studies. This can help them financially as well as it can help them to gain experience of practical life. If they get job related to their major of studies it provokes their skills in that field and help them financially as well. But beside this it can affect their studies very much, because they can not give proper time to their studies & like this they can't score good grades. Some of the students work hard enough that they maintain their grades and job very well. But some students concentrate on their job and lose their study. But beside all this it is some how necessary for the students to do some part time job. It will help them a lot polish them selves and support their pockets as well. In foreign countries like America and Europe students prefer to do some part time job, like this they are supporting their selves as well as they are contributing in the prosperity of their countries also. In Pakistan we students should try to have some part time job and government should help them by providing jobs in civil and government sector so the students can help them selves.
