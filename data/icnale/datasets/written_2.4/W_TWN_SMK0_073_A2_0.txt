Smoking is bad for our health, so I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, and even all the public places. My father and my cousin are smoking for years, we often ask them quit smoking. Because smoking not only harm their health, but also make passive smoking. Many people hate smoking because of passive smoking. They consider that passive smoking is more harmful than smoking, so smoking has many shortcomings; it will harm one's lung and somebody around the smokers. People start smoking for different reasons. Some think that smoking looks cool, seems like an adult. Others start smoking because of their family members or friends. No matter what reason for smoking, it's true that smoking will make people addicted. It's hard to quit smoking, smokers should have strong willpower, defeat their desire, refuse to the smoking temptation. In recent years, the government starts paying much attention to the problem of smoking. In order to control the smoking problem, the government makes some laws to follow the rude. I think that this is good for everyone, and we should take the smoking problem seriously. If your family members or friends would like to start smoking, you must prevent it. Not only good for him or her, but you.
