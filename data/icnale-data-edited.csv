But I do not think so. I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life for several reasons. Firstly, a part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games, which are pointless. Why not take a part-time job instead of participating in those entertainments? You can even earn some money from the job by yourselves at least. Secondly, a part-time job can add to your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that cannot be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest advantage for graduated students when they interview for jobs. It's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly, as a matter of fact, a lot of college students are from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the ways to afford their college fees. Although the money may not be enough, that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Studying must also receive our attentions, so we should balance the part-time job with studying well. After all, the first job of students is studying."

Now we can see everywhere that students take part-time jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. Why do they do these jobs? What advantages benefit them? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study materials are more expensive than before. Then the student has to take up some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer be dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we have learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, work experience offers a lot of benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to have some jobs: we not only make money, but also develop our independence. Thus, if you have a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret it."

Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in the common opinions of society, as well as in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' lives in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents no longer have to give money to us or can give less money to us. It can help with the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our abilities. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationships better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words, we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that we have earned by ourselves will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, and the house built by ourselves feels more comfortable. In the same way, spending the money earned by ourselves is more fulfilling. No matter where you come from—a poor family, a rich family, or a well-off family—having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."

In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students busy after classes. But why is it important for us to have part-time jobs? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our studies, so much time is wasted on playing computer games or doing other boring things. If we have a part-time job, we will try our best to do it. After all, it's a way to show the abilities we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us know more people. Colleges just have students and teachers, but society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things of which you have never heard. Through your part-time job, you could develop good interpersonal relationships. After you graduate, you will go into society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, the most important benefit is that you can get the experience that books can't teach you. Practice is the way to show your knowledge. If you can only talk about how to do it, no one will believe that you can. You have to study what you should do, and part-time jobs would let you experience this. Thus, college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important."

What should the college education be? What ought college students to learn? The most common argument is whether college students should take a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job is vital for students. As we all know, students have a lot of free time to manage, so it would be very convenient for them to take a part-time job. In the future, students must step into society and face a variety of difficulties. Having a job can help them gain life experience; what's more, they can meet all walks of life and learn how to cope with complex relationships between them and colleagues. Further, students can make their own money and may realize that it is hard for parents to earn money. However, having a part-time job also has an unfavorable aspect. As the main task for students is to study, having a job may occupy most of their free time and may affect students' daily lives. Taking a part-time job is not a bad thing as long as we do not overwork but stick to reality and our personalities. I think if we can manage our time efficiently to take a job, we will be sure to get lots of benefits and more chances to be distinguished in the future."

Some students do sports, such as playing football and running. Some students play computer games, such as dota and dnf. Some students read books, such as novels and poetry. What I think is the most important thing we should do in our free time is working in a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. Thus, having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantial. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problems and how to work with others. We can also develop good habits. The most important lesson is that we can understand how hard making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study as hard as we did in senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge."

Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, there are also a lot of students with a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think that they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can prepare them for jobs in the future. Second, they can acquire money on their own, cultivating their independence and skills. Finally, they can meet and interact with a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in school. In contrast, the people who take the second view think that it's not suitable for students to have part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being distracted from the knowledge that they should gain in school. If they are distracted, they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. Thus, it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on a part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try to have a part-time job without putting all our time and energy into it."

Is it the money, or is it the experiences and the learning in the process of working that lure you to take a job? As we know, most of us have to step into society after graduation, and the society which will confront us is quite different from the campus life we are used to living in. So, if money is your solitary goal and you cannot be distracted by the expansion of your circle or the acquisition of communication skills, I suggest you'd better concentrate on your study and do not bother to think of a part time job for the simple reason that high marks can get you a better job. But if you want a part-time job for more than just money, you can gain the advantage of all that it has to offer. In the change from an excellent university student to a new employee, you may be subjected to scorn and criticism often, which will prompt you to reflect on yourself and define who you are. Taking a part-time job will give you a glimpse of the real world and make you well-prepared for the future. By observing society first-hand, you learn a lot outside the book. So, you can see my opinions quite clear now. Put away the money you can get and let yourself develop quickly in your part-time job experience!"

But is it necessary for them to do so? In my opinion, the answer can be various, depending on the students themselves. Undoubtedly, taking a part-time job is a special experience which provides youths with the chance to become familiar with society as well as to gain more practical skills. In the process, students learn how to communicate with different kinds of people and how to deal with challenging situations. Besides, the money they acquire from the job will certainly reduce their parents’ financial burdens more or less. However, it can't be ignored that some students fail to do more important things in order to take part-time jobs. They spend time that should be focused on learning to work, thus leading to a decline of grades. The fact is that the first priority for students is still studying. Additionally, some young people fail to spend their money reasonably. Instead, they fall into the habit of wasting money. Thus, it can be concluded that taking a part-time job is rewarding and eye-opening for those who have good self-regulation, but it may produce some negative side effects if the student lacks good planning skills. In common with many things, having a part-time job is a double-edged sword. If you want to have one, do be careful."

For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for the following reasons. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning money. What values more is the experience you get to enhance your abilities and skills such as communication, independence, problem-solving, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from a part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity for getting involved in society and forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are also adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay in. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time to the extent that you may feel stressed. Thus, you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life."

There are reasons why a part-time job is important. First, it can improve our abilities which cannot be learned in class, like communicating with each other. Second, every company that you want to apply to consider real job experiences as a very important thing. So when interviewing, you will gain advantages over other people by owning a part-time job. Further, a part time job is really a preparation for one's future professional job. However, as a college student, the study of textbooks seems very important, and we have to take all kinds of tests. Doing a part-time job may have a negative effect on the score of tests, and may cause very serious impacts. If your scores are low, you may even lose the ability to graduate from school. Working at a part time job may influence you to see the negative side of our society, eventually causing a negative effect on your mind. Thus, I think it is very important to balance our part-time jobs with our university life. Getting high scores while doing a part-time job is a task that not everyone can achieve. As such, we should give up the part-time job at a certain point."

Is this good or bad? As far as I am concerned, it depends on the time you spend in doing it. If you spend a proper amount of time on it, you can benefit a lot from it. Firstly, having a part-time job can enrich the student's social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he will learn how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself that he learns that acquiring a living is not an easy task. In this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to manage his money properly. However, having a part-time job also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. Having a job means that our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty. Once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job might prevent you from being fully absorbed in your major studies. Thus, just as each coin has two sides, taking up a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it."

For me, I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. First and foremost, it is a perfect opportunity for experience-lacking college students to practice their knowledge. Part-time jobs open a new door for inexperienced students to encounter and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizons and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking up part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group can bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their lives and allow them to realize the hardship required to acquire every coin. As to those against part-time jobs, saying that they are a waste of time and have a bad impact on studying, I don't think they are right. As mentioned above, having part-time jobs is meaningful, as it not only strengthens students, but also makes them mature enough to set foot into society. As for studying, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to studying by combining theory and practice. All in all, taking up part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students."

Thus, the question of whether college students should have a part-time job has aroused wide attention. Indeed, we should attach more importance to part-time jobs. College students can benefit a lot from having a part-time job. To begin with, we can earn some money in order to lighten our parents' financial load. As we all know, college tuition is not a small sum of money. Some students pay a lot for it, only to gain little knowledge in their college lives. Beyond that, it is also a heavy burden, especially for a less well-off family. Besides, in the course of the job, we have to cope with a variety of people and communicate various words. Obviously, it is a great opportunity for us to gather experience and learn interpersonal skills. Further, what we learn from the part-time job can contribute to the future development of excellence. Last but not least, we can adjust ourselves to the society in advance. When we enter society, there are many objective factors that you can never change or foresee. That is to say, what we learn in college is theoretical and not enough for us to face all kinds of situations. It is because of the part-time job that we learn to combine theory with practice. From this, we can draw the conclusion that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."

It is natural that people from different backgrounds hold divergent attitudes towards the issue. People in favor of having a part-time job claim that it can release their financial burdens, especially as it is already common for young people to bear a loan from the bank to support their families or themselves. Further, a part-time job may even entertain the person as well as bring in money, if the job relates to his or her interest. In this way, people will make full use of their time and be energetic all the time. In contrast, people who hold the opposite opinion argue that a part-time job will occupy a big share of people’s attention and may lead them to poor health. They cannot focus their full attention on their main work, which is why part-time jobs are banned in lots of companies. For my part, I would side with the first point of view. Part-time jobs do fill our spare time when we have the passion to do something interesting and attractive. So seek a part-time job, and be rich both in wealth and spirit."

As you know, most of our college students are already over eighteen years old, which is to say, we are adults. As such, we should try our best to be independent, and not just depend on our parents. The best way to be independent is to make money by ourselves. At the same time, the money we make can also be used to buy something that we want and to do something that we want to do, such as traveling, attending some clubs and so on. Besides, part-time jobs can develop our abilities and establish a good foundation for our future jobs. It is known to us all that experience is very important when applying for a job. Furthermore, a part-time job can help us find out more about the society and let us know what kinds of people society needs. Only in this way can we make good decisions and choices to shape our future.

To be financially independent is the perfect way to claim that we are independent individuals now, that we are no longer kids under the protection of our parents! Secondly, and also most importantly, having a part-time job allows you to be involved in society. It allows you to find out what the people outside of school look like, how they behave, and how hard it is for us to make money to support ourselves. After going through all of the difficulties that we will encounter, we will gain a lot of experiences. When we graduate and when we next step into society, we will be confident that we are already well-prepared and that we can do it. Thus, we will learn that money is not easy to earn and that our parents are great. We ought to respect them and appreciate what they have done for us. I'm sure we will be more mature and more considerate to others. Working at part-time jobs is a way to see what life really means.

For example, if you take a part-time job as a freelance photographer, you may have to prove to your customer through a portfolio that you are a real photographer and that you can complete the job in a good condition and take good pictures. If you have good management, you can save a lot of earnings from your part-time job. On the other hand, some parents do not want or disagree that college students should have a part-time job because they think that if the students have a job, they may become lazy to go to class in university. However, the condition applies again for the students: they must be able to arrange their time."

Different people have different views. Some students advocate the idea for several reasons. One reason is that we college students should be responsible for ourselves, and a part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we would not have to ask our parents for allowances. It can also relieve the financial pressure of our parents. Another reason is that through a part-time job, we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will be good for us to prepare for our future jobs. As the competition is fiercer in society, the more experience you have, the more chances you will have to succeed. However, other students are against this idea. They hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on studying. Working at a part-time job will require much of our time and energy. The life and property security of a part-time worker are also not well-protected by the law. From my own perspective, as we enter university and gain more free time, it is important for us to choose how to use our free time. We should make the most of it and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in a restaurant in my free time, and I am happy to have the job."

Nowadays, a large number of college students have a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine, for example: when Lily was a college student, she worked in the supermarket as a promoter or worked as a private tutor every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly acquired a good job after graduating from university. In terms of other students' opinions, they think that they can buy the desired goods that their parents cannot afford. I know a student who works part-time in a restaurant as a waiter so that he can earn enough money to buy a computer. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents don’t always agree with us about getting part-time jobs. They are afraid for our studies and our safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is beneficial for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to gain knowledge from our part-time jobs and use them as helpful tools for our development."

Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, I disagree with this. I have some reasons to support my idea. Firstly, I think that everyone has tasks of varying levels of importance in different periods. For a student, studying is the key priority. If you cannot study well, you will be wasting your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden by taking a part-time job. However, this might have a bad effect on their studies. They do not know that the most important thing that their parents want is for them to learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention to your studies now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, but learning professional skills and applying your knowledge into practice yourself are the most serious tasks during university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. Thus, don't be influenced by others and try to keep gaining knowledge; you will succeed in the future as a result."

As current college students, we should take an active part in the part-time job, if we accomplish our studying tasks first. With the constant development of the economy and society, everyone, including students, is faced with great challenges. Many students who graduate from university cannot find a satisfying job. They also suffer from great pressure. Having a part-time job can benefit students who will enter into society to some extent. First of all, students can improve their other abilities through the work experience. Moreover, they can familiarize themselves with the society in depth. Besides, students are informed of the fact that society isn't favorable to everyone. Those who long for great success and an enjoyable career must exert themselves to study hard. In this sense, students are alerted about the hardship through the part-time job. Take me for example: I once worked as a waitress in a small hotel. During this period, I had to serve customers and take their orders. I served dishes and rice for them, and I was rather tired during these days. Though the pay was low, I was excited. I learned that everyone should spare no efforts to do something if they hunger for a better life in society. I will commit myself to studying hard. All in all, there are important advantages for college students to do a part-time job during their time in university."

Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' financial burden. Besides, it can also increase their chances to practice their knowledge in society. However, some people object to this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste the students' time and affect their studying. Therefore, students should just focus on studying hard. As far as I am concerned, students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well-informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, by being selective, they can avoid working at jobs that everyone can do, and thus avoid wasting their time and learning less. Not being selective will make working ineffective because they won't be doing the job that they should be doing. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and be selective about the kind of job that we take."

The following reasons explain my idea. College students need to not only gain knowledge of books, but also practice their knowledge in universities. College students have a part-time job, which fulfills their interests. College students can acquire knowledge from books and practice through home teaching, and they can get life experience through a part-time job. They can discover their shortcomings and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, the achievements of people who have also experienced university life prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. During college, students go through the experience of a part-time job, and all levels of their abilities are raised. They become more confident about themselves and they have great motivation to work. The reasons above explain why I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is good for the development of college students. Thus, if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get one and work hard at it. You will receive advantages."

Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. As for me, I don’t think that it is a good idea. To have a part-time job is not as important as making a great achievement in your studies. Having a part-time job means that you won't have enough time to study. As a result of this, the quality of education will decline, and many students will not be able to absorb enough professional knowledge that would be suitable for future work. Meanwhile, as many students will earn extra money from their part-time jobs, they will get into the habit of spending their money unwisely. Since they have worked hard to earn money, they will think that they deserve a luxurious life instead of studying after working for a whole day. How can a tired student study hard in his or her lessons? In other words, the disadvantages of having a part-time job for a college student outweigh the advantages. We can't only focus on the working experience of students. Instead, gaining knowledge of the professional field is more important when we are still students. Thus, we should try to pay more attention to our studies now rather than working at some part-time jobs."

Some people think that there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs because they can gain experience and build up their good character. Further, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs, so if they are from a very poor family, they can reduce their family’s financial burden. However, after-school work also brings a lot of problems. For example, some students think about their part-time jobs all the time and cannot decide that study is more important right now. As such, some students now have some problems with studying and some don't even go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and gain important knowledge. They can earn money later. Thus, college students need to know that studying is more important than working right now."

While we are growing up, we can look after ourselves. It was our mothers who took us into this beautiful world. They taught us how to walk, to speak and so on. Now, it is our turn to care for our parents. Thus, earning enough money by working for our boss at a part-time job may be a good choice. In addition, we enrich our experience, which can only be acquired from a real work environment. On the other hand, we shouldn't focus too much of our attention on it because we are just students right now, not workers. If we don’t have enough fundamental knowledge, then we can't do well in our part-time jobs. Do not forget that our studies can help our work while our work can help our studies. To obtain much knowledge is the main mission of college students. How to balance studying and working is the main challenge for freshmen. Thus, planning is most important. Having a part-time job during summer or winter vacation is a great idea. We are also adults, so we can make our own schedules. A part-time job is an important part of our college student life!"

In my opinion, it is not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. I can list some reasons to explain my opinion. First, although studying in college is relaxing, it also requires hard work. For students, every second is important. If we have time to do a part-time job, why not spend the time on gaining knowledge? Second, as most college students don't have much social experience, they can be cheated very easily by others. They don't have the ability to keep themselves out of danger. I think the school environment is very safe. If students go out to work, I can't imagine what danger they will encounter. Last but not least, nobody can guarantee that the part-time job will give students a lot of valuable experience. On the other hand, it's very beneficial for students to join a school club or do extracurricular activities. They can chat with other students; they can share happiness with each other, which is a very good thing. All in all, having a part-time job is dangerous and unnecessary for college students. Maybe students are curious about the part-time job or they want to try it. However, I think the knowledge of books is also interesting."

From my perspective, this phenomenon is good. It is really important for college students to have a part-time job, as a part-time job may let students gain more experience, help them apply their knowledge, and allow them to know how hard it is to earn money. Firstly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they may gain plenty of advantages while working. They may learn how a job functions, how to work with their colleagues and boss, and how to be confident. For example, I worked for a TV program as a translator for a month, and I acquired the benefits mentioned above. Thus, a part-time job is really important for a college student. Secondly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they can practice what they have learnt in college. Practice is the only way to verify knowledge, and further practice can also help our studies. When I was working for the TV program, I really learnt a lot. I have to say that all of the things that I learnt there were really useful. Therefore, if a college student wants to gain more, he or she should go and find a part-time job. Lastly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job can help them establish the conception of money. They will soon learn how difficult it is to earn even $100, they will understand the value of money, and furthermore, they will understand their parents. In other words, college students can grow through a part-time job, they can practice their knowledge more, and most importantly, they can establish the right conception of money."

Maybe some people think that taking a part-time job can help them in many respects—help them explore the knowledge outside of books and even gain financial independence. There are others who think that part—time jobs will have a strong negative influence on studying, as working often gives students strong pressure and becomes a burden. This might make students join fewer college activities. In my opinion, I think students should pay more attention to studying than to part—time jobs. A part—time job is a small priority for students. For college students, time is very limited and valued. If students spend their limited time on working at part—time jobs, there is no doubt that they will have less time for studying. They will also have little time for college activities. If someone thinks a part—time job will give them extra earnings, I am certainly against it. College is not the proper period for students to earn money. It is the best time for learning varied knowledge. If they gain some money now, they will lose a lot more in the future. To sum up, college students should not take part—time jobs when they are studying in college. Part—time jobs just make students lose their way or lose heart. For students, school work is more important than having a part—time job. Knowledge is power."

For a college student, studying is most important. Most college students believe that a part-time job can offer them more job opportunities in the future, and that it can also improve their confidence and sense of responsibility. In this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. However, there are other college students who believe that college is a place of study. They consider that if we spend too much time on working at a part-time job, we may delay our school work. In this respect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. Recently, college has become more and more market-focused, and a college student must be provided with a variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities."

In addition, a part-time job not only takes up much of their free time but also means little to them. On the contrary, others think that it is acceptable, reasonable, and beneficial to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it is undeniable that college students can accumulate certain experiences through part-time jobs. Then, as a result of doing the part-time jobs, they can earn some pocket money to reduce their parents' financial burdens. What's more, admittedly, if students carry out some more work during their free time, they will find that life is not so dull and that they can do something meaningful to enjoy their college life.

The modern times in which we live accommodate the need of teenagers to have their own source of income. A part-time job not only enables students to promote their abilities, but also helps them to apply their knowledge into practice. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can relieve the financial burdens of their parents. Studies should remain the main focus of students, but if they have the chance, they should earn some money and gain experience while they're in school. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situations. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and their studies.

Alternatively, it can help relieve our family’s financial burden. However, there are also many disadvantages. If we have part-time jobs, they are likely to distract us from studying. We may spend too much time and energy on working. For example, we may lose the time needed for sleep, rest, studying, club activities, and recreation. It may thus be harmful to our health. In my opinion, college students should have the right attitude when it comes to part-time jobs.

As has so often been emphasized, the theoretical knowledge that we've learned in class should be applied into practice. Having a part-time job is an ideal method to increase one's practical skills and expand one’s social network during college. Besides, a part-time job can be a stimulus for students to study harder. Through working, one may find what one lacks in terms of skills or knowledge, compared to an experienced employee. Thus, in order to have a better career after graduation, one may have a better idea of one’s goals for studying and achieve greater progress. Moreover, students who have a part-time job may become independent earlier than those who don't, for they may obtain a clear view of money through earning it on their own. However, the disadvantages should not be neglected. Having a part-time job may occupy too much time, which leaves little time for studying. Instead of acting as a stimulus, in this case, the part-time job becomes an obstacle. Such cases should be taken into consideration since they happen all the time when there's a big project at work for one to conduct. Lacking the ability of time management can make the situation even worse. In conclusion, whether a part-time job is important to a student depends on the work load of the job as well as the ability of the student. There's no easy way to answer this question."

Different people have various opinions about this issue. Some people think that it is the golden chance for college students to put their knowledge into practice by themselves, while others believe that it is a waste of time to do a part-time job. As for me, I feel that a part-time job does more good than harm. Generally speaking, it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, a part-time job will provide more social experience. Those who have a part-time job are more likely to get in touch with various people in society. They can learn how to get along with different people and solve a problem in a short time. It's not hard for us to find that the students with a part-time job are more active and efficient in both their studies and their work. In addition, a part-time job will show them the significance of cooperation. If students would like to work at a part-time job, they must talk to their workmates and cooperate with them. Their habit of cooperation will also play an important role in teamwork on campus. However, on the other hand, if one spends so much time on a part-time job that it affects one’s study, then one should decrease the time spent on working or give it up, for our main duty at present is to study well, not to earn money. In other words, a part-time job is really beneficial to us, so let's take an active part in it!"

For me, I think the bad effects of a part-time job outweigh the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge and to try to get involved in many fields, such as those outside of our own majors. However, a part-time job would take up most of our time, and if we cannot use our time in university more efficiently, we would lose the opportunity to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, apart from part-time jobs. For the students who are in great need of money to get through their university, a part-time job isn't the only method. They can ask for some funding and scholarship from their school, or apply to be a TA. Thus, we can find some academic ways to make money. Besides, an internship is a better way to get social experience. Further, a part-time job would scatter our focus from campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must prepare for the classes and travel to the classrooms or the students' houses. All of these things will bother us and disrupt our peaceful campus life. To sum up, a part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we do in university will determine the path of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of this period."

By undertaking a part-time job, we can gain at least three major advantages. First and foremost, through certain kinds of part-time jobs, our knowledge fields are extended and our horizons are broadened. For instance, if a student majoring in engineering works as a marketing intern during his vacation, he can gain more knowledge in business management. Such practice is of much significance to the overall development of a future talent. Secondly, the experience of internship helps students a lot in dealing with various cases and communicating with people from all areas. Staying at school, students interact frequently with fellow students and professors, but they are only a small part of the whole society. By going out of the school and immersing ourselves within a complex enterprise, we are urged to approach and meet our supervisor and boss, who are usually successful and competent in their own fields. They can be good mentors for our future career development. In addition, by working part-time, students can earn some money, which alleviates the financial burden of their family. College students are mature enough to be financially independent. To sum up, taking a part-time job benefits students on many levels, and it must be a good choice for us when arranging our holiday schedules."

Young people at this age have the need to prove that they are mature enough and can live on their own. However, when more college students are stepping out of the campus looking for real life, they don't realize that the temptations outside, the damage to their imagination, and the time and energy that they will need to devote to a job may actually jeopardize their minds. One of the disadvantages of taking part-time jobs during college is that students may be tempted by the material world. Different from campus life where everyone is the same, in the real world people are divided into different levels. College students, being somewhat egoistic and ambitious, would soon be tempted by power and social status and forget that they are still students. Moreover, beautiful clothes, delicious food, and luxurious cars can easily attract students' attention and lead them to chase after material things. One possible result is that students won't be able to sit in the classroom and focus on their subjects anymore, let alone spend years working on their research. In addition, taking part-time jobs would influence students to become more realistic and would take away their imaginations. While college students are dreaming of developing new technology and changing the world, business people in society are caring about how much profit they can make out of their investments. Students having experienced the real world tend to consider so much more than others, including money, advertising, and possibilities, etc. Gradually, their imaginations would be damaged. Then, we will only have a bunch of engineers instead of scientists. After all, students' priority is studying. Since taking a part-time job may mess with students' minds, ruin their imaginations, and waste their time and energy, students should not take the risk. Jobs will always be there. College students do not need to be in such a hurry to find employment."

Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as cancer of the lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public places, especially in all restaurants. There are two reasons for that. The first one is that restaurants are public places where people have meals, so keeping the air clean is the duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollute the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke; it is no doubt that harmful substances will stick on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food will be. I think no one would like this environment when eating. Secondly and more seriously, the people who sit around the smokers have to breathe second-hand smoke, which is more harmful to their health than smoking is to the health of smokers. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of second-hand smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about other people, and should not maintain their habits over others' health. All in all, I agree with the government in banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country."

As is well known, smoking is a killer of humans' health, does great harm to our respiration systems, and finally makes our bodies weak. To make matters worse, most healthy people dislike the smell of smoking, which concerns not only the citizens but also the whole impression of the restaurant. So we could safely come to the conclusion that smoking is harmful to everyone eager for health and honor, except for the factories making cigars and  the like. However, even though smoking is hateful, we'd better say that we should try to control it rather than ban it, or we would be subjective. For one thing, some people here couldn't give it up right away, for smoking is the comfort in their lives. It's possible that if one could live longer without happiness, one might prefer to choose a shorter life with happiness. Thus, we shouldn't take away people's happiness at the moment until we find something else to replace it with and they are willing to accept it. For another, restaurants are places where citizens experience life and relax themselves. Many are accustomed to smoke there. As we see, having a smoke in an ordinary restaurant is like a function of the restaurant itself. From the above, we come to understand that smoking should not be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Instead, we might try to find other ways to improve the environment in which we live. For example, there could be restaurants and other public places made especially for smoking, where you could smoke as you like without any limitation."

But as we all know, cigarettes contain some poison. Many countries have banned smoking at public places. It's not enough; smoking should be stopped not only in public places but also in restaurants in the country. Scientists have proven that cigarettes have nicotine. It's a kind of poison. People who smoke for a long time may get nicotine poisoning, and if it's very serious, they will die because of it. Further, people who always smoke can also get lung cancer. It can't be cured. Patients suffer unimaginable pain. Thus, to maintain or improve human beings' health, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also unhealthy for the people around them. When one person is smoking, the people around him may get second-hand smoke. The second-hand smoke also contains nicotine and is also harmful to humans' bodies. We can see that if people smoke in a restaurant, everyone in the restaurant will be harmed by them. As far as I know, smoking also pollutes the environment. The smoke it produces will pollute our atmosphere. So if we can ban smoking, we will save our world. I don't know why people invented smoking, but I know why people should stop smoking. In other words, smoking is bad for our health and also harmful for our world. Banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country is a little step. One day we will stop smoking all over the world!"

So should smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer is positive. A cigarette includes a lot of harmful materials. As you know, it's pernicious for our health. Smoking negatively influences not only the person who smokes, but also the other person who smells the smoke. If plenty of people smoke in public places, human beings' health will be harmed, even if they haven't smoked ever. After all, it is unfair to let somebody smoke anywhere around them and destroy their bodies. Of course, restaurants are the places where we can enjoy our life. We should eat food with happy feelings. A cigarette can attract your attention, and then you will forget what you are enjoying. It's a bad habit that disrespects nature. We'd better be grateful for the entire world. Besides, smoking in restaurants easily causes fire accidents. People often forget to put out the cigarette, which causes the accidents. Out of the many things that the above has shown us, the most important thing is that a lot of people can die in fires. The sad experience warns us to be careful with smoking. In other words, smoking leads to too many unhappy things, and so it should be banned at all restaurants in the country."

Smoking has become a widespread phenomenon. Men, women and even children have the habit of smoking. We don't have the right to stop them from smoking, but the law can decide where they can smoke and where they can't. As such, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking can release one's stress indeed, but its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. It is harmful to our body, especially the lungs. The smoke that smokers release also does harm to nonsmokers. Restaurants are public places where people have meals, and so the environment must be clear. Smoking in the restaurants not only pollutes the environment but also pollutes the food. What's more, smoke can spread freely in the restaurant, which is to say, all the customers in the restaurant will suffer from the awful gas, and the quality of the environment cannot be assured, nor the meals enjoyed. Hence, banning smoking in restaurants is a wise act and we must conduct it as soon as possible not only to make the dining environment more comfortable but also to make us more harmonious and healthier. Only when we do that can we enjoy our meals in the restaurant with delight."

It is easy to see that smoking is very bad for our health. What's worse, second-hand smoking hurts our bodies without our knowledge. This problem is so serious that we have to do something to protect ourselves. The most effective and easiest suggestion is banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Most people in the world don't like to smoke and large numbers of them even hate it because of its uncomfortable gas. So banning smoking not only meets people's will, but also saves their lives. Tobacco is also very expensive, which means that smoking wastes a lot of money, and that quitting smoking can save money. The restaurant is the most important pubic place in our daily life, so banning smoking here can lead to the biggest and best effects. We do not want to be hurt when we have a good time, which would be very disappointing. Another reason is that a restaurant is a closed space with minimal airflow. People do not move often in restaurants, so bad gas can't be dispelled and can cause great harm. There is no benefit that we can take from smoking. Smoking greatly hurts smokers' and others' health. Thus, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country."

I believe that smoking recklessly in public especially does harm both to the health of the people and the environment. As such, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in public. The following reasons support my argument. Undoubtedly, the banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there will be less second-hand smoke released into the air, and people will have fewer chances of being exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, a non-smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good moods. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring for others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to society, why not do it? All of the aforementioned reasons tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement of our public environment, though it is a little harsh to the smokers."

Smoking in restaurants can not only give rise to unpleasantness, but also cause harm to other guests' health. As the air circulation is not good in a restaurant, the smell of smoke will probably affect other people. This little activity may completely ruin a dinner; how can you do that! On the other hand, there is no need for me to throw light on the harm of second-hand smoking because everybody knows it! Guests should not smoke in a restaurant, and neither should the cooks and the waiters, because the ash and smoke could directly get into the food and then get eaten by the customers. Meanwhile, smoking being banned does not mean that you could not smoke during a meal. If you cannot afford to live without a cigarette at the moment, it is OK for you to smoke outside. Maybe it is a little inconvenient, but for other people's sakes, do not complain! For the two reasons mentioned above, and the fact that you can still smoke outside the restaurant during a meal, put your hands up to show that you are with me! Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country."

Thus, I am for the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, a small cigarette contains a great amount of harmful substances. Undoubtedly, the one smoking is constantly exposing his lungs to those substances, which, according to many researches, damage not only the lungs but also the heart and digestive system. Besides, second-hand smokers are victims as well. Although they are not addicted to smoking, they are affected unconsciously when staying in a room full of poisonous smoke. The restaurant is a place where people enjoy themselves by eating delicious food. As a result, a clean and comfortable environment should be provided instead of one that is full of cigarette smoke. At least, the health of children cannot be ignored. In other words, these are the very reasons why we should do something. In fact, some countries have banned smoking in public places years ago. Facing an increasing rate of diseases caused by smoking, we may as well try to take forceful measures, such as making laws, to reduce smoking in public places, and now, to stop smoking in all public places."

For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smokers and the second-hand smokers are risking their health, even their lives, on cigarettes. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious and that it is our duty to value it. Therefore, stay away from cigarettes not only for yourself but also for others around you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others is bad manners; it not only makes an awful impression on others' minds but also misleads children in regarding it as an acceptable or even cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in public places. In other words, let's create a smoke-free atmosphere to enjoy our meal.

It should be a choice of the restaurant owner. Then I would foresee that most restaurants would become non-smoking, or at least a few would still keep ashtrays on the tables. However, what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke, but I still see people smoking. I would be strict about banning smoking. Now I will give you my reasons. A person like me who does not smoke also have the right not to smoke, I mean, second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking, including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia lists several million words about the bad effects of passive smoking. According to some experts, the effects of passive smoking are even worse than those of first-hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effects on pregnant women and little babies. Thus, considering our country's future, I am strongly against smoking. Restaurants are places for eating, for satisfying your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute the desire for smoking. It might be easier to forget smoking, especially for smoking addicts. Thus, smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in school restaurants."

People have been discussing heatedly whether this ban should go into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial. However, for smokers, it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, many customers, who spend much money in going to restaurants, just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time there, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second-hand smokers. On one hand, burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxins that are hazardous to life, among which nicotine is the largest killer that can greatly increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smokers experience psychological harm as well. When they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety can increase. Finally, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the littering of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, no smoking, no crying! Taking all of the factors into account, I stick to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants in the country."

As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as follows: first and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lungs, which can lead to fatal diseases, such as cancer. Secondly, as a restaurant is a public location, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those around them. What's worse, if there is a pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, as there might be many non-smokers in the restaurant, perhaps even some smoking-sensitive people, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' moods in the restaurant. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers are addicted to smoking, many other spaces outside of restaurants are still provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government implements some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, ought to join in this campaign. Smokers can remind themselves that smoking is banned in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can give advice to those who want to smoke during dinner to not smoke instead of just tolerating them or quarrelling with them directly. Only in these ways can smoking be completely banned in all restaurants in the country."

As lots of researches have shown time and again, quitting smoking contributes to the decrease of lung cancer incidence. Further, with every month that passes, there is more research showing the benefits of quitting, and the drawbacks of not quitting. Obviously, it is high time that we took some measures to solve this problem, and the smoking ban does help a lot. To start with, the smoking ban is the wave of the future. During recent years, people have paid more and more attention to their physical conditions. In some public spaces, like restaurants, people are forced to inhale second-hand smoke. Non-smokers long exposed to second-hand smoke suffer even more harm than smokers. Furthermore, for the smokers, if they know smoking is banned at the restaurant, they may smoke later. Since they can't see other people smoke, their desire for cigarettes may abate. Over a span of time, they may be less addicted to cigarettes. Lastly, the smoking ban also brings benefits to our society by contributing to the improvement of our social morality. Honestly, we still have a long way to go as regards the smoking ban, but we can reach the goal step by step. As far as we can see, banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good policy. Only in this way can we finally make the smoking ban come true!"

There are so many bad habits accounting for this issue. Smoking is one of these concerns, particularly smoking in public places. If people ask me whether we should ban smoking in public places, as far as I am concerned, I would agree that we should ban smoking in unsuitable situations, particularly in restaurants. Firstly, you are unconsciously harming the health of the people around you, no matter whether you are willing to or not. It is unfair for others to bear the bad effects of smoking. People come to have meals in restaurants; they don't come to get harmed by second-hand smoke. In the second place, it is considered impolite to smoke before many non-smokers. Gentlemen will never smoke before a lady and will speak ill of smoking. Last but not least, smoking is obviously breaking down your health, wherever you smoke, as cigarettes contain a variety of poisonous materials. Taking all of the above into account, we can easily draw the conclusion that banning smoking in public places is essential and that getting rid of smoking is also necessary. Thus, we should ban smoking completely in restaurants for both smokers’ and nonsmokers' health."

Both men and women smoke here and there. We all know that smoking is very harmful to our health, so banning smoking is very necessary, especially at all restaurants. Obviously, restaurants are the places where we take a meal. There are many different people together there. If there are too many people smoking at restaurants, it may lead to many serious problems. Firstly, it will make the restaurants chaotic. We all hope that we can have a meal in a good atmosphere. It is very hard for us to tolerate eating food in a bad environment where there is so much smoke. Secondly, smoking would produce much cigarette ash. It is very easy to make restaurants dirty with cigarette ash. We also can't have a meal in a dirty place. Thirdly and most importantly, smoking at restaurants is too harmful for our health. To start with, it is harmful to smokers. Smoking too much is very unhealthy for the lungs and the liver. Thus, forbidding smoking at restaurants is mainly good for smokers. Besides, it can be good for others at the restaurants. As we all know, smoking may cause more serious harm to people who don't smoke than to smokers themselves, especially when it comes to children. In any case, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. Everyone should applaud this wise idea, shouldn’t we?"

If you fall into the habit of smoking, it will be very hard for you to unlearn it. As is known to all, smoking really does harm to our health. Cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine, which are harmful. Many heavy smokers get lung cancer after having smoked for a period of time. Smoking not only does harm to the smoker himself, but also has a bad effect on the health of the people around. This is called ""second-hand smoking,"" and it is very harmful to the public’s health. In the restaurant, when people are having meals, if other people smoke around them, their health will be affected. Smoking also influences the moods of people nearby. If someone is smoking in a restaurant when we are eating, we will feel annoyed and lose our appetite. Therefore, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country, but of course can be allowed somewhere else. Our government should do something to support this suggestion, such as implementing some laws and rules. More importantly, we ourselves should try our best to obey the laws and rules. Then the health of our people will improve greatly."

It affects the health of the person smoking or in the atmosphere of smokers. It completely destroys the respiratory system, including the lungs and the respiratory tubes, and causes a very dangerous type of cancer. Smoking includes the use of the common cigarette to that of a developed form of cigarette that includes heroine. It involves every dangerous narcotic. Its ingredients that are very dangerous to the health are tobacco and nicotine. Nicotine is very dangerous to the memory of a person. Along with causing health problems, it is a habit that is very expensive. One has to spend a lot of money to keep up this habit. If one has no money, one does crimes to fulfill one’s need. Smoking completely destroys a person. The damages affect both physical and psychological health. A person with such a habit cannot do his work properly. He cannot give the proper time to his family. His health would be down day by day, as the average strength of a smoker is 70% of the strength of a non-smoker. This habit is very common in young boys. We should take steps against such a habit. Seminars should be arranged against smoking, as smoking is very dangerous to our health."

I will show the different opinions below. Those who are in favor of the idea claim that we all know that cigarettes contain many harmful materials that can cause lung cancer or other incurable diseases. As such, it is very harmful to smoke. On the one hand, smokers will waste a lot of money on buying cigarettes. On the other hand, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and the people who smell second-hand smoke. Further, there are also many examples of people who have suffered from diseases owing to smoking too much. Thus, for the benefit of smokers themselves and other people, it is a wise choice to ban smoking in restaurants. Those who are opposed to the ban hold that smoking is a personal habit just like some people’s habits of reading or running. As such, others have no right to interfere. Besides, a restaurant is a place for people to eat meals and relax in, so smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. As far as I am concerned, my favor goes to the former opinion. If the policy is successfully implemented, we can enjoy our meals in a healthy environment."

However, I don't agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to support and explain my opinion. For one thing, everyone has his or her own hobby. No one likes others to change his or her hobby. If somebody likes to smoke, we have no right to prevent them from having dinners at restaurants for this reason. For another thing, restaurants are public places, and while smoking at public places is not good, we can do nothing but advise smokers. However, the restaurants' owners can set up a room for smokers. When they want to smoke, they should go to that room to smoke. This can separate smokers from most customers, and I believe more and more customers will be interested in the restaurants that reserve a room for smokers. With this method in restaurants, both smokers and other customers will be happy. Thus, it is difficult to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country because we can do other things to solve this problem. However, as we all know, smoking is an immediate threat to health; it can cause serious cancer. As such, we all had better smoke less."

People always say that smoking is harmful to our health and that we should reduce the population of smokers. Nevertheless, should smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country? My answer to this question is yes. On the one hand, smoking does less good than harm to our health. As a restaurant is a place of eating and drinking, if one person in the restaurant starts smoking, it will pollute the whole air of the restaurant. Those people around the smokers will not have the good mood to have their meals any longer. Some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous in many cases. We know that people in restaurants all want to be healthy. On the other hand, smoking in the restaurant may cause the restaurant to catch on fire easily. It is dangerous for us to have a meal in a dangerous place. I read some articles in the newspapers that indicated that some restaurants caught on fire because smokers threw their cigarettes into some places in the restaurants after smoking. Thus, because of the reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let us keep our eating environments healthy."

As you know, a restaurant is the place where people have their meals. The most important thing for a restaurant is to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke in the restaurant, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop cigarette ash on the tables or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent people from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better environment for our meals in the restaurants. However, there are possibly some bad effects from this ban. On the one hand, smoking is the sign of a man. The relationship between smoking and men is as important as that between make-up and women. Thus, a man at a restaurant, especially during the time of dinner, seems to be superior to others. They may feel that smoking is representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessmen sometimes smoke at restaurants in order to cope with some difficulties and carry out negotiations smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country."

This phenomenon brings great damage, especially when it relates to smoking in restaurants. Some think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants; others don’t think so. I prefer the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my opinion. On the one hand, smoking in restaurants will damage smokers’ health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for non-smokers to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in restaurants. So we must insist on the ban. On the other hand, smoking will damage the environment. People want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment of the restaurant will make people unhappy and have a bad effect on them. People will not like the restaurants if there are many smokers inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that restaurants will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem."

My reasons are below. Completely banning smoking at all the restaurants does not fit with the world of reality because a lot of men smoke now. As such, it would be impossible to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men may be against this ban. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. Further, those smokers will not go to the restaurants with the ban, which will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problems. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harmful for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for the health of the people, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking helps them in many ways. Some say that they feel happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoke, for all the restaurants want to get more financial gain. I think maybe we can do another thing to solve the smoking problem in restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now."

Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom to smoke will be limited, but smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who die of cancers related to smoking has increased rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also that of second-hand smokers. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effects of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke has been rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. Customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to smoke in restaurants. How can a restaurant provide satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places in which to eat and enjoy ourselves. Smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurant's services. Given these reasons, we can now draw the conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary."

Now, I like to discuss the reasons for my opinion. To begin with, smoking in the restaurant is a right. Restaurants are public places for all customers, so no one is qualified to limit who can go to them. What's more, people should observe the law, and not just do anything that they want to do. In the next place, we can reserve a smoking room for those people who are already addicted to smoking. In this way, we protect the smokers' personal rights. Additionally, when smokers eat in the restaurants, they will not disturb the other customers. Then, the quantity of cigarettes sold will decrease, thereby affecting the economy of the society immediately. On the other hand, which is the last point, this ban will not only incite smokers' negative moods, but also lead to the development of a social trend. Some smokers think that smoking can help them solve difficult problems and relax their thought. In the end, to draw a conclusion from above, I strongly believe that smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can take some other ways to solve the problem of smoking in restaurants."

I have some reasons to support my idea. Smoking is an unhealthy habit because cigarettes contain burnt soil and something that can cause cancer. It also destroys people’s bodies. Smokers usually have some diseases. People having smoked for a long time are killing themselves day by day. What is more, it is obvious that the people who eat with them breathe in the same polluted air, which leads to people losing interest in what they are tasting. Further, the second-hand smoke is harmful to their health too. If the law of banning gets through, the atmosphere of restaurants will be more perfect, and the good smell of delicious food plus nothing else will fill the whole room. The more fresh air they breathe and the less smoke they inhale, the longer life they will have. The cleaning of public places should not only be applied to the restaurant. The dining room should be completely devoid of smoke too. If all the restaurants are clean, I believe more people will benefit from this. So all in all, the government should do something to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country now."

On the one hand, smoking causes diseases in many people. We know from books that smoking harms not only the people who smoke but also all the people who sit around them. In some magazines, some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous sometimes than first-hand smoke. Many people die because of second-hand smoke. In restaurants, the people who smoke are harming the people who are having meals in the same place at the same time. On the other hand, smoking makes the air in the restaurants terrible. In our country, many times I have had meals in restaurants where someone sitting close to me has been smoking. It has made me feel uncomfortable but I never know what to do. I am sure that smoking is harmful to everyone. There is no denying that if smoking is banned in all public places like restaurants, most of us will breathe in fresher and cleaner air and have a happier meal.

First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our bodies, especially while there is smoke in a restaurant. As we all know, cigarettes equal poison. However, we can't ban cigarettes due to the contribution to the economy given by cigarette companies. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people. From my perspective, smoking in public is rude, for smoking is a kind of private behavior, and many people hate the smell of smoke. So smoking in a restaurant may make people feel unhappy. Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmonious society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seeking—a harmonious society. In that case, to get a better image, to build a civil society, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

A restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smoking will destroy the warm atmosphere and also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that smoking depends on personal preferences, but it is a selfish behavior. It will make other people unhealthy. The important thing is that smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like the people who smoke in public places. As is known to all, smoking just increases the risk of cancer in people. Moreover, second-hand smokers are more influenced by the smoke than smokers are. Especially in public places, smoking is extremely harmful. The smoke from cigarettes is poisonous gas. If there is no one smoking in a restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokers give up smoking so it would also be beneficial for them. A professor called Peter in a Hong Kong university said, “One cigarette can kill at least 50 mice.” Smoking just makes people feel bored with no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this by themselves. We have an obligation to make sure that people have healthier lives."

I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I used to ask some people why they would want to smoke. They answered that there are many reasons for it. The first guy said that his work and family gave him much stress, and smoking seemed to be the only way for him to release the pressure. Moreover, smoking has been like his best friend, one to whom he could tell everything that he wanted to say. The second guy also had the same reasons as the first guy. In addition, he thought that if he could smoke a good cigarette, he would look like a rich man. So I thought smoking was a way to show one's riches. Through the analysis, I think smoking in all restaurants is nothing but harmful. There are three reasons to support my ideas. First, smoking is usually bad for our health, and if he or she is smoking in the restaurant, the smoke will spread out all over the restaurant, and other people will also be affected by the smoke. Second, as using a good cigarette to show off one's riches is not a good social trend, we should ban this bad social trend together and encourage people not to smoke in restaurants anymore. Third, a restaurant is a place where some people can eat food or chat with others. As such, if you are smoking in the restaurant, you may affect other people’s ability to eat food happily. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

Personally, I think it is important to ban smoking at restaurants and that we should not allow this condition in restaurants anymore. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to smokers and others in the meantime. Although some people are addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the health of others in public. Moreover, it is commonly believed that smoking destroys the elegant atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers don't want to get harmed by cigarette smoke in restaurants. They come to the restaurants to have meals in happiness. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after the struggles of so many people. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurants and solve the problem as soon as possible."

Of course, as stress from people's daily life increases more and more, the number of people who smoke increases as well. Nonetheless, there is a problem concerning whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, it is needed. First, smoking causes many deaths from lung cancers. Second-hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also a bad example for teens and young adults, as it shows that it is okay to smoke. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Whether there is a non-smoking section or a smoking section does nothing. The smoke still spreads throughout the restaurant. Some people are sensitive to cigarette smoke. Further, smoking doesn't just cause damage to other people’s health, it is smelly as well. People who are non-smokers do not want to smell like smoke. Thus, this ban must be implemented. A non-smoking person should be able to sit down in a restaurant and not inhale unhealthy smoke while they eat. If people want to smoke, they can go outside, or if the restaurant is smart enough, it would create a whole new room that is separate from the non-smokers. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country."

People who smoke argue that the ban takes away their freedom. However, nonsmokers advocate it as a good rule. From my perspective, I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking, which will bring many diseases, does harm to our health. Besides, smoking releases much smoke into the air, which pollutes our environment. What's more, many people cannot put up with the smoke, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that banning smoking in all restaurants will promote workers’ efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoke in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and the environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe fresher air in the future! Today, more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which causes great harm to people's health."

About this ban, different people hold different views. Some people agree and some people don't agree with it. In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There are a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking. What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it, so they will smoke in public places such as restaurants. However, nonsmokers hate it; they hate to smell the smoke. They even complain that they are inhaling second-hand smoke in restaurants, which would do great harm to their health. Therefore, smoking is really harmful to people in restaurants. It will also affect people's appetite. I hate those who smoke in the restaurant. Firstly, it does harm to everyone. Secondly, I think it is an irresponsible behavior. Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer and heart problems. Some smokers have also decided to give up smoking. Some of them also think that the law banning smoking can encourage them to give up smoking. Above all, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants."

In the whole country, measures have been carried out to prohibit smoking in many public places, such as restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, I'm definitely in favor of this rule. What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. As is so often pointed out, smoking for a long time is likely to result in lung cancer. However, there are certain quantities of people who just cannot give up the ""terrific"" feeling of having a cigarette, even though they are clearly aware that they are risking their health. It's not other people's business if they only smoke alone, but when they're smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, more concerns should be taken into consideration. Numerous statistics show that ""second-hand"" smoking is more harmful than smoking directly. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his/her cigarette in restaurants, where people may not be able to stay away from the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him in danger, including those who never lay their hands on a cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior that is done in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by cigarettes may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already decreased the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely enjoy their dishes. Besides, the smell is also not pleasant to those who don't smoke at all. Take myself as an example; I can't help sneezing even from a slight smell of a burning cigarette. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country."

They often light a cigarette in any place they like, especially in public situations, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. Accordingly, I suggest that smoking should be mainly banned at all restaurants in the country. The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and that of the people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that heavy smoking is likely to lead to lung cancer, which is a deadly disease for human beings. Banning smoking at restaurants is an effective way to control people’s smoking habits more or less. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy their meals with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have good appetites, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Nevertheless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke in. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by the smoke. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can safely draw the conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we should appeal to our friends to support it."

According to the statistics shown in newspapers, about five percent of deaths are related to second-hand smoking. Due to the terrible effects of public smoking, I hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in any public restaurants across the country. By doing so, one of the most important favorable effects is that diseases related to smoking, such as lung cancer, can be cut down significantly. The ban contributes a lot to the creation of a healthy dining environment for people who frequently eat outside, which takes up a large proportion of the whole population. Secondly, prohibiting smoking in some public areas contributes greatly to the development of social culture and ideology. Like drunken driving, which poses threats to citizens' safety, smoking in public does harm to others' health. Such behavior is against our goal of establishing a harmonious society. In addition, the forceful act of a complete ban raises the awareness of the harm of smoking among the general public. More and more smokers will gradually get rid of this bad habit for the interest of their own health. To conclude, it is high time for us to take strong measures to put an end to this smoking era. A complete change to the legal system regarding the smoking issue is necessary for the final settlement of this social problem."

Smoking does great damage to the health of smokers and the people around them; for example, second-hand smoke greatly influences the consumers while they’re having dinner. Moreover, a place that is full of smoke would damage the dinner atmosphere and have a bad effect on the consumers' feelings. Thus, from both the consumers’ and the restaurants’ sides, smoking should be completely banned. Besides, as we all know, the behaviors in public decide the quality of the people in the country. If smoking isn't banned in restaurants, the image and quality of the Chinese will be misunderstood. Our country has become stronger and more powerful within these years, and so the quality of the people should be improved by the efforts of all of us. However, the government and the restaurants should also learn from the experiences of the 2010 Shanghai EXPO. We can build some places for smoking, or just set a room for the smokers, as this is a concern for them. Thus, smoking should be banned, but we should also spare some room for the smokers."

In restaurants where people come to relax and feel refreshed, smoking, the selfish behavior that ruins people's appetite, raises health concerns and shows disrespect, should be completely banned. Smoking should be banned in restaurants since it ruins people's appetite. Scientific research has shown that when people say they love a dish, 70% of their joy comes from the smell of the dish instead of the taste of the dish, which means that although the food in a restaurant tastes extremely good, the smell of cigarettes can easily get mixed up with the smell of the food and ruin people's appetites. Smoking also leads to health concerns, which is why it should be banned in restaurants. People are all aware of the danger that smoking may bring. However, the danger of second-hand smoke is even worse. Smoking in restaurants is forcing so many people around the smokers to take in the second-hand smoke, which may lead to public health issues. It is not one person that the smoker has influenced but close to a hundred. For the sake of health concerns, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Finally, smoking in restaurants is disrespectful. In a restaurant, when a smoker is talking to his company with a cigarette in his hand, he is likely to puff the smoke right in front of his company's face. More than that, the smoke would rise and go anywhere without permission. Further, smoking in restaurants is an insult to the chef, as it suggests that the chef’s food can't satisfy them but cigarettes can. Smoking in restaurants is totally inappropriate and easily affects many people. This behavior should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

My part-time job is teaching junior high school students Math and English. I have learned many important things. For example, how to talk with my boss, how to deal with personal information and how to associate with my colleagues. If I didn't have it, I would not have any common knowledge, common sense or friends. I think I grew as an adult compared with when I was a high school student. Second, it is a chance for us to know the importance and value of money. When I received a salary for the first time which was made by myself, I thought that I mustn't waste money. Until I entered college, I used to be bought many things by my parents. It is not too much to say that I didn't know how hard we work to make money. Recently, many college students have a part-time job. I think they also learn many things like me. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

More and more college students have a part-time job, they are able to prepare for their future life when they will work for their families. If college students don't have a part-time job and don't know what life is, they will have great difficulty in working. During college years, managers don't blame college students heavily if they make a mistake. But in a company, managers blame them heavily. To get used to work and earn money, college students need to have a part-time job. College students need to have a part-time job to know what a life is.

This is because, I think that college students need a lot of money. I have two reasons for this. First, they should buy many books and read them. They can study a lot of things from the many books. If they go to the library, they can read many books, but they are forbidden from writing in the books from the library. I think writing in books for studying is very important. Therefore, college students need a lot of money to buy a lot of books. Second, they need to make many friends. To make a friend, they should belong to a club. On the club activities, they will need a lot of money. If they get friends, they can enjoy eating and drinking with their friends. On summer vacation, they can plan to have a trip overseas. I think college students need to study and play. A part-time job gives them not only the money but also the wonderful experiences. It is a  very precious thing working in society, and finding out various things. For example, they feel the importance of being responsible for their work and difficulty with getting money.

For me, it's really important to go out with friends and go shopping, go to stylish cafés, and drink. I can't survive without money from my part time job. Some people get money from their parents, but I don't want to bother my parents. They already pay for my school and rent, it costs a lot. I think I have to earn money for my amusement by myself. Another reason is that we can get valuable experiences. We meet new people and learn about customer service, how difficult or hard it is to get money before we graduate school. I could thank my parents as I knew how to make money and how hard it is. Also, I learned about the service manners which would be useful when I get a job. Of course studying is the most important things for students, but we won't be able to get this kind of experience in university.

Because they need training to work before they graduate. Studying in college is very different from working in society. If they don't study hard that is a personal problem but if employees don't work hard that is not a personal problem. If they have a part-time job they can learn  a lot. For example: responsibility, hospitability, communication skills, how to solve problems, and so on. They will also quickly get used to working when they have a full-time job as they have experience working. But working in college is not the only thing to do. Of course they need to study and read. If they don't study their college fee is of no use. However a lot of students tend to take their time to work for money that they can use for what they want. They need social training but they have to understand what is important to do now. They can work as much as they want after they graduate. But college life only happens one time for many students. So it is important for college students to have a part time job, and it is also important for them to study. Balance is key to success in their college days."

If students don't have a part-time job and they only study and enjoy their free time, they never experience the importance of earning money. Second, they can meet a lot of people through a part-time job. In college, people who come  are almost the same age. Probably, there are other college students, or women who have children, or people from other regions etc. These people can know many things that you don't know or you won't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at the place you work. Third, if you experience many kinds of work through a part-time job, you can learn what work is about. And you can imagine how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for the future before you graduate college. So having a part-time job is very important. I think that having a part-time job is as important as studying in college.

We go to a university to learn many things before being employed and we have a lot of  time to do something after classes. We can choose whether we have a part-time job to learn how work or not. So we should have it. Secondly, I suppose we should know how hard earning is. I did not know that earning money to live is really hard until I had part-time job for which I could thank my parents. I think it is important for us to know how hard earning is and to thank our parents. Thirdly, we can use payments from  a part-time job to do many things for experience. As I said we have a lot of time in a university and we can do something for ourselves using payments from our part-time job. For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference and so on. I think that experiences will help us after we graduate.

They're also going to get responsibility for money so they will never waste it. In the near future we college students will have our own family. We will have to manage money all on our own. We should be independent and learn how to control money as soon as possible. Secondly, for students to know society. Now, in university, lots of students are so lazy. Some are always late for school, some often sleep during class and so on. Thanks to having a part-time job, they can know the responsibility for their tasks. There are many differences between college and society. In society, rules are much stricter than college. If they don't know their society at all, they may not be able to be hired because of bad manners. So for students, a part-time job is a  good opportunity to practice for the future. Lastly, for companies to save money. Now in Japan, the economic situation is not good and companies hire fewer people than usual. So they are in trouble because of lack of staff. If companies hire general people, they have to pay a lot of money. But for students, the pay is only about 800 yen per hour. Companies may want to hire students more than general people. In conclusion, I think college students should get a part-time job both for students and for companies."

The reason is that they can learn a lot of things which are very important but which are not taught in schools. For example, they can learn how to build a good relationship between colleagues or their  boss. Whatever part time work you may be doing, it is usual that you need to cooperate with others to work. Through this kind of cooperation, they can learn what is important to make relations with colleagues or bosses better. In my case, I teach English to high school students in a cram school as a part time job. Through the experience of cooperating with other teachers and teaching students, I realized how important it is to mutually communicate with people. Another example is that they can grow a respectable attitude towards money. Through working hard and then getting money as a salary, they may realize that getting money requires hard work and how important money is. This also applies to me. Before I started to work as a part time teacher, I thought that money was something that was given by my parents for free but now I think that money needs labor and time. In conclusion, a part time job can teach many important things to students. Therefore, college students should have a part time job."

I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two main reasons. The first reason is that students should study. What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job. For example, my friend has a part-time job teaching English to elementary school students. She is so busy everyday preparing for teaching. She often checks their answers to examinations even during classes at  university. Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare for teaching all night. I don't think it is good for her. In that case, her part-time job prevents her from studying. The second reason is that many students spend most of their salary playing, not living. They mainly spend their money on clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling and so on. This means that most of them don't work for a living. For instance, my friend who I stated above is one such student. She lives with her family and doesn't have to work. However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion. In closing, I don't want to say students must not have a part-time job, but it is not so important for them. Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job."

They can learn what they are good at and how to speak to others. They can understand what they are good at or not. There are some types of part-time job, teaching, delivering, cooking, customer service and so on. Home teacher, for example, is a typical job for college students. Those who have no idea of his/her future may want to be a teacher be being a home teacher. Or, those who want to be a teacher may change his/her dream because he/she realizes him/herself not good at teaching. So it's a good chance for college students to know themselves. Next, it is important to speak politely when we speak to others such as our boss, strangers and so on. When they only spend their time in college, they only speak to friends and they have few chances to speak politely. So in order to learn how to speak to others, it is valuable for college student to have a part-time job. So as I said, they can learn what they can do and how important it is to be polite through a part-time job."

There are two reasons that I support this opinion. First, part-time jobs are the only opportunity to experience what a job is and how it works, before entering a company. Before entering universities(even after entering them), almost no students have decided what type of jobs they want to do or which company they are interested in. For those students, part-time jobs are good chance to find a job which they truly want to do. Also, in Japan, once we enter a company, it's very difficult to quit the job and to find another job, even if the job is uncomfortable. However, you could have many part-time jobs and quit them easily. I myself have been working in the cram school, and I learned a lot of things. Second, most university students don't receive their allowance from their parents. So, they have to work to earn money for leisure activities, for payment of mobile phones, or dating with their boy/girlfriend. In some clubs whose club dues are high, all members do a part time job as a club activity. For them, part-time jobs are a very important for their daily lives. To conclude, I strongly suggest that university students try to experience part-time jobs as much as possible, as long as they do not become an obstacle to studying."

To be sure, to have a part-time to live is vital for college students. But it isn't good to earn money for play. Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students. How to use their time all depends on them. Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends. Making many friends in college is good, however, but studying is also important. In college, there are many things to do, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on. So, college students should actively challenge how much they can do in college. By challenging themselves a lot, they are able to do their best with confidence when they work in the future. Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students. So, it costs them a lot of time and effort to get money by working part-time. As a result, they can't often concentrate on a class and study for a test in college. It is not good for them. Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

I have three reasons for this. First, they can learn a lot through having a part-time job, and it will be useful in their future. For example, I worked at a Hotel as a service staff member at the banquet. Through this job I could learn that it is not easy to earn money, and I felt appreciative towards my parents, because they have worked for me since I was born. If I hadn't had a part-time job, I would never get such an understanding. This is just one lesson from my working experience, but I believe every college student can learn something important through doing a job. So in my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. Second, having a part-time job gives them a lot of information about occupations. Then if they have a several kinds of jobs in their university days, they can know what kind of jobs they really want to do in the future. I mean that having a part-time job brings happy lives for college students. Third, I think students have to have a part-time job, and earn money by themselves, because college students need a lot of money for trips, study, or to play with their friends. They should not make their parents pay all of their expenses. They should try to be independent from their parents. So, they have to work in order to earn the money that they need. In conclusion, from these three reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students."

I have three reasons to support my stance. Firstly, a part-time job is an important chance to experience society. Because a college is the place to prepare before going to the real society, a part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we may enjoy it. In my experience, I learned that even one mistake cannot be allowed in service through working in bakery. I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors. The second reason is to solve a monetary problem. I think college students need a lot of money for texts or for some entertainment. However, we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents for finance. Therefore it is better to earn by ourselves as much as possible. As for me, I can live without working if I could ask my parents to support me but I chose to work. This is because I have to learn how to manage myself before graduating university. After I started to work, I actually began to understand the importance of money when I buy something. Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to get new friends. In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited. However, if we work, we can meet many kinds of people regardless of ages or location. I think such relationships are precious even after getting older. For all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students."

Of course, I have a part-time job. A part-time job can be a valuable experience. Many high school students are banned from having a part-time job. Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers ban them from doing it. Yet, college students are free to have one  and have a lot of time. They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from classes because of it. Through a part-time job, I learned the difficulty of earning. Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully. This is an important thing in my life. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job. Then it is too late. People are not apt to forget things which they learned when they were young. My mother said it is very valuable for young people to have trouble. So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on. Those who acquired these will live comfortably as a result. A great life waits for them."

I think that study is more important for college students than having a part-time job. Of course, if college students could do both equally, it would be best. Yet most of them, at least those around me, can't do so. This is especially true for students from national colleges who are given a lot of money by the country for going to college and studying. Therefore, I think they must study hard to become the people who are capable of doing something. Sometimes I hear the opinion saying things like the following: “College students should have a part-time job because it gives them many experiences to live socially”. I think doing various things is good for young people, too. At the same time, I think it is ridiculous to have part-time job that takes a lot of time when all of the rewards are just money. Seen in the long span, it is better  for college students to study hard about their specialties than spend their precious time on a part-time job. Studying is making their career. If they have to pay their college fees by themselves, they should have a part-time job but, if their parents or country do so, they should have a part-time job to live or to study not to play."

Of course, college students have to study but study isn't all they have to do. They also have to experience a lot of things before they graduate from  college and begin to work. For example, reading books, listening to music, playing sports, and going on trips. In regards to trips, they can go where they haven't visited, see what they haven't seen and feel something special. College students are not children but also not adults. Time while being a college student is time to experience and feel a lot of things  as they prepare to become perfect adults. For that, they need some money. They have to prepare the money they need by themselves, because they aren't children. Their parents mustn't give them money and they mustn't depend on help from their parents. To use the money they work to get is important. By using money they work to get, they can know the importance of money and ways to use money. That's why they have to have a part-time job."

I have two reasons. The first, is that many college students don't have money but they need a lot of money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with theirs friends, going anywhere and buying anything that they want. Yet, when they use their money to buy something, theirs parents don't always give some money to them. So they need to have a part-time job. By the working they can get some money, also experience selling products and services and learn the difficulties in earning money. This is the first reason. The second reason is that the wages for college students are cheaper than other workers. So if college students work part time, many companies and shops can hire them without paying higher wages to employees.  Now the condition of business is very bad in Japan. Some people think that because college students work part-time, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and so the unemployment rate is high. Certainly the population of the workforce does contain a number of college students and the part-time work done by college students causes the rise in the unemployment rate. Yet it is said that business in the world is the worst for a hundred year so when business gets good the unemployed people now will be able to get work and the unemployed people will be fewer than now. By college students working part-time, many companies and shops can decreased the payment of employees wage. So I agree with the statement."

Now I am in the third year of university. When I entered the university, I had to have a part-time job because I needed money. If I do not work, I cannot have fun in my college life. For example, drinking, travelling, buying clothes would be impossible. If you want to enjoy your college life, money is really one of the essential things. That is why it is very important for college students to have a part- time job. By the way, I am sure that you can gain and learn a lot of things if you have a part-time job. In a part-time job, you can meet lots of kinds of people, for example other university students and regular workers. By communicating with such kinds of people, you can learn and be stimulated by them and possibly make friends with them. You can also experience the first stage of social work. When you are in third year, you usually go job hunting. If you work at a part-time job, you can talk with regular workers and see the real work place and also notice the difficulty of working there. For that reason, experiencing a part-time job can help you job hunt. That is why I strongly believe that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job."

I want to explain the two reasons why I think that college students should have a part time job. The first reason is that college students should really know the value and difficulties of getting money. People need money to live. A lot of money is needed for one person to be self-sufficient. Basically, college students depend on their parents, especially for money. But most students don't know how hard their parents work to earn enough money for their children. I think they should know how hard work is needed to get just a little money through a part-time job, as their parents have learned. The second reason is that college students can learn about social interaction through part-time jobs. Common sense as an employee is really essential for business, for instance, how to communicate with other people in business and how to talk. A part time job could be only one place that students can learn about society as working adults. Student can communicate with colleagues in their part time job to learn these skills.

Part-time work is also important for students because the experiences that they have in their part-time jobs are very useful when they look for what they want to be in the future. They can do various types of part-time jobs, so it helps them to look for what they want to be in the future, and they cannot have a part-time job when they start to work full-time. When they are college students, they have a lot of time to work in a part-time job, but when they start to work full-time, they don't have time to work part-time as well. Part-time jobs are also important for college students because their experiences having a lot of part-time jobs when they were college students will become a good memories in the future.

I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, students cannot concentrate on their college studies if they have a part-time job. I think that the most important work for students is studying. However, if they have a part-time job, they have to spend a lot of their time on their part-time job. Thus, they tend not to be able to focus on their studies in college. I know some of my friends, who have part-time jobs and spend most of their time on it, almost always take a nap during their classes. This happens because they work hard until mid-night for their part-time jobs and can sleep only four or five hours in the night time. In this example, having a part-time job prevents college students from studying. Secondly, having a part-time job sometimes damages students' health. As I mentioned above, because of their part-time job, some students cannot get enough sleep. This can cause serious damage to their health. Also, their job requires them to work several hours, sometimes seven or eight hours a day, so they tend to lose their regular diet. Therefore, having a part-time job causes serious damage to students' health. Finally, students tend to waste money if they have a part-time job. Although there are a few exceptions, most students are given financial support by their parents. Thus, most students do not have to pay their college fees and other kinds of fees on their own. This means that they can freely spend the money that they earn from their part-time job. Thus, some students tend to buy very expensive things without adequate reflection. For these three reasons, I disagree for the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

I have to be on time because if I am late, I interrupt my colleagues’ jobs and make bad relationships. I can't stay self-centered because guests choose the restaurant which they want to go to, so I need to make them comfortable when they choose my shop. I learned from part-time jobs about the importance of making money and making relationships. But I learned it is tiring to have job at the same time. I need time to rest and recover. So it interrupts my study to have too much work.

I think having a part-time job is important for college students. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, thanks to part-time jobs, students can earn money by themselves. For ordinary families, college fees are very expensive. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by having part-time jobs, they can help their families. Moreover, even for students from rich families, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things. For example, they can travel or study abroad. So, in this way, having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. Secondly, thanks to part-time jobs, students will have social experiences that they never learn in school. For example, in food stores or restaurants, they are taught manners and how to speak to customers politely. Such skills will be useful after they become working adults. Moreover, they can learn how hard working is. It is said that these days young people soon quit their jobs, but if they know about the reality of working before they graduate from college, they can persist even if their work is hard. Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

I have two reasons why. One reason is to make money. College students have much free time compared with other members of society. Adults often say, “I have money but no time.” As college students, we can do what we want to do as far as time permits. Therefore, we need money. The other reason is to have many opportunities through part time jobs. Part time jobs enable us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manners, and so on. As for me, I have had a part time job and worked at a doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started my part time job, I have changed. For example, I come into contact with a wide range of people from children to old people through my part time job. I have learned how to talk with a range of people. This skill has helped me in job interviews. Consequently, I received an informal job offer. In addition, I sometimes travel using the money I have earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa, and so on. I had invaluable experiences in these places. I couldn't get such experiences by relying on pocket money from my parents. But there is one thing that I must not forget. The main work for students is not their part time job but study. So students must hold a part time job so that the job doesn't interrupt their study."

There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by holding a part-time job, they can find that earning money is very hard. Because of this, they will think seriously about how they use their money. College students have a lot of free time. If they want to travel abroad, they can make money by working in part-time job. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work full-time. Secondly, if they have a part-time job, they can meet people from a variety of generations, from children to senior adults. Through this, they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they work in a part-time job, the more they are rewarded. For example, their salary per hour may be increased. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can learn their most suitable future job such as teaching children, serving customers in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers, and they teach junior high school students while they are studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. Responsibility is an important thing to learn for when they work full-time. As above, they can learn society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students should have a part-time job."

There are three reasons why I agree. First, college students need a lot of money. They must pay college fees. They also need to buy clothes, and to eat and drink in order to be sociable. They should not force their parents to pay a lot for them. They should pay the costs by themselves, so they should have a part-time job. Second, they can make friends when they work. By working together, they will become friendly. It is very good to have many friends. For example, when a student has a problem, he or she can ask their work friends for advice. Their advice might be different from college friends’ advice. It is important to hear many kinds of advice. Finally, a student is able to practice for their future job by having a part-time job. If they have not had a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them. To have a part-time job is a good chance to what kind of job is good for a student’s future. Some people might say that students can study more if they don't have a part-time job. This is true, but I think it is more important to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will make a student a better person. This is why I agree with the statement."

Here are some reasons. First, college students have much more free time than junior high school students and working people. So, college students have to use some time for working. If they have a lot of time, they often use the time for only leisure. If they use it for a part-time job, they may get something good for their life. This is the second reason. College students can learn a lot of things that they can't learn in their college. They can learn, for example, the difficulty of making money, systems in society, and they can also learn gratitude to their parents. Third, I think that college students should be independent of their parents, because college students aren't children; they are almost adults. It is difficult for them to be completely independent from their parents, but it is important to become independent in some ways. One of the points I think is having a part-time job. They should make money that they use for leisure. Even if the money they can earn is only a little, the action can help their parents, I think. Those are the reasons why I think that college students should have a part-time job."

There are two reasons. First, college students can learn a lot of things that they don't study at college through working. For example, relationships, skills and manners. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant. The work is very hard, and I often receive advice from colleagues and from my boss. Sometimes I am scolded very badly. I want to quit the job when the boss scolds me, but my colleagues and boss help me when I'm in trouble. In fact, I really thank them because they teach me important things for fitting in with society. I have also become responsible because of my job. I really realize that I have matured through working. It is good for me. Secondly, college students can communicate with many people with whom they can't speak in daily life. In the Japanese restaurant where I work, there are many housewives. I sometimes feel that there is a generation gap, but talking with them is very fun. We talk about raising children and money. They talk about things that I don't know about. It is very interesting for me. I think having a part-time job gives a lot of important social benefits to college students."

I have two reasons why I think this. First, they need money. It costs a lot of money to enter a university. Of course, it is not the students but their parents that paid the money. I believe that students should pay back the money more or less to their parents, and some students want to go to graduate school. In addition, generally, college students spend a lot of money. For example, they spend money on buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with their friends and participating in club activities. For another reason, through working, they can learn how the society is. A part-time job teaches them how to make good relationships with other team members and their boss. They attain various kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rules are. They will also learn how difficult it is to make money. You may say that if you work too hard in your part-time job, it causes bad effects on your study in university. This is true, but, actually, students have the ability to control their own shifts to some extent. If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher. Besides, I have a lot of friends who work really hard and get great school records. That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students."

Today, part-time jobs have spread to many areas of industry and have become important roles in these areas. Many companies want young people to work as part-time workers, so we who are college students, young men and women, have more chance to experience the difficulties of working in adult society. For example, I am working in Kobetsukan, a private school with lessons similar to those in a formal school, as a part-time worker. That is my first job as a job to make money and teaches me about the realities of being a worker in adult society. In the private school, I am called Mr/Ms NARUSAWA, and students see me as a professional teacher, but I cannot judge whether this is true or not. When I was seen as a professional worker, I could learn the meaning of working in adult society. It is that I have to play a role as the character other people expect me to. That I knew the mean is the biggest mean for working as a part-time job."

I think college students should do things what they can do only when they are college students, for example, read many books, go for a trip, play sports, take part in club activities, etc. Indeed, you'll have some time for these things after starting to work for a company, but there will be less time. Like many people say, you can work as much as you like after graduating from college. The only problem is that all the money you use for these experiences is earned by your parents, not you, so you must be careful not to waste money and time. You should always keep in mind that time is finite. As long as you think the things you are going to do are necessary for your future, you should do them. So, if are willing to be an owner of a restaurant in the future, having a part time job at a restaurant might be a good experience rather than just reading books about management or food. But, in my opinion, I think students should read books. Reading books on various topics will surely have a positive effect on your future."

However, I think that their concern is nonsensical because students know the importance of study, and they will study in their free time. I think there is more advantage to having a part-time job than disadvantage because of the following reasons. First, I think that doing a part-time job will help students' parents. Having a part-time job makes students earn extra money. Thanks to that extra money, some poor parents who cannot earn enough money for their child to go to college can send their children to college. Second, having a part-time job makes students develop economic independence from their parents, and they can realize the importance of money. Third, the most important reason I think, it is useful for them to experience working life before they work at a company. If they have a part-time job, they can take responsibility and get many job skills, for example, greeting people, conversation, presentation and so on. So, they will be able to work better than those who have never experienced a job. That's why I think having a part-time job is important for students."

If you have a part-time job in a juku, you must have your own students. You have to study, too. Your previous study is useful. The second type of part-time job is a job in a store. If you work as a shop clerk, you must communicate with a lot of customers. Your communication ability will improve. You will have a lot of responsibility. It is hard to continue a part-time job, but responsibility is needed in society. You will have to have responsibility for everything you do when you become an adult. If you have a part-time job, your perspective will be broad. Before you start life in society, you should practice communicating with many other people and learn how to survive in society."

I think part-time jobs are not necessary for college students. First, college students must study hard. It is very important for college students to study. I think that a student is a person who studies academically or is educated, not someone who works. If a student thinks that their study is finished when their classes are finished, they are wrong. Study is not limited. Second, I think that college students, whether or not they have a part-time job now, will graduate and be working about four years later. After all, college students will have to work in the future, so they should not work now. Third, working is very hard and takes up a lot of time. A man said that one hour for a college or university student is worth ten years to an old man. Actually, the period which is spent in college or university is very important. Students must spend this time seriously. Fourth, there are a lot of things for students to do apart from study. Club activities may benefit college students. Club activities teach a lot of things that are not taught in education. College student should spend a lot of time in these activities, not working.

Then, experience from their part-time jobs will help them. For example, if they work in an office, they can learn computer skills. Second, part-time jobs also give students social experiences. Students learn how they should act in society. For example, if the students work as waiters or waitresses, they can learn polite expressions and good manners. This will help them when they are given a job interview. And, of course, in the company, politeness and manners are also very important. Third, most student work in part-time jobs so they can earn money. They can use that money as they want. For some students, that is the first money they earn all by themselves. They can learn the value of the money they use, too. They can also learn how hard it is to earn money and live in the future.

Of course there are both good aspects and bad aspects to having a part-time job. I'm going to write why I don't agree with the idea by showing both good aspects and bad aspects of having a part-time job. Let me explain. They say young people can acquire far more things than older people in the same time. If we have a part-time job, we can get some money, and getting money from one's work is surely a good thing. However, we can't actually have what we could have acquired if we had done something other than working. This is a bad aspect of having a part-time job. On the other hand, having a part-time job itself can teach something important to us. For example, through a part-time job, we can realize the value of money, or realize our parents' effort to raise us, know how we can give better service to customers, or encounter many people and enhance our knowledge. Those are the good aspects of having a part-time job, and we cannot do those things by just reading our textbooks or something like that. In my opinion, college students should regard their study as more important than anything else. If we want to experience the good aspects of having a part-time job, I think it is a good idea to have a short term part-time job. However, I think having a part-time job regularly can sometimes affect the quality of college students' learning. Therefore, I think it is better for them to study as much as possible rather than to spend their precious young years, unless they are in a financially difficult state."

Second, if they work in various situations, they will learn how to communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate from college, so they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become employees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the main thing that they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money, so I think they should work during summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it will enrich their life."

But college students must work after graduating from college, so while they are college students they should learn about working. Because of this, I think they should have a part-time job. If they have a part-time job, they can get some money. In addition, they can learn the difficulty and the importance of earning money. By getting some money they can travel extensively and go abroad to learn about other countries’ culture, leisure activities, language and clothing, etc. But they must not work too much, since their aim, as students, is to learn a lot of technical knowledge. I think they should not work more than four times a week, because working four times a week is more than half of the week.

Some people may say he shouldn't smoke when he eats dinner, but it is a matter of freedom for him to smoke. It's his own problem whether he smokes or not. Some people dislike smoking, but others do not. What shall they who don't like cigarette smoke do? Almost all restaurants in Japan have non-smoking seats. People who dislike smoking should use these seats. Then, they would not be interrupted by smoke. In Japan, smoking is not banned.

If smokers have to stop smoking and don't know what to do, they have great difficulty in smoking at the restaurants. When smokers want to smoke a cigarette and they realize that smoking is forbidden, they are heavily disappointed. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, smokers won't make trouble at restaurants for people who don't smoke. I think the best way for Japan is to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. In doing so, smokers will learn that smoking is not good for other people. In college years, people don't judge smokers harshly if they smoke. But in society, people judge smokers harshly.

First, smoking is bad for one’s health. Those who like smoking will disagree, but smoking causes harm to all people, including non-smokers. People from the elderly to children all go to restaurants. At restaurants, people enjoy eating and talking. If people smoke in the restaurant, other people may think the food isn't delicious. They might have a sore throat and be unable to enjoy talking. I think that a restaurant must be a place that is comfortable for all people. In addition, completely banning smoking helps to stop smoking and improve people’s health. If the number of places that forbid smoking increases, smokers should put up with smoking a long time. Today, many restaurants in Japan separate the seats that allow smoking from the seats that forbid smoking. However, if we sit in the seats that forbid smoking, I feel uncomfortable because of smoke in the air. This is because the restaurant isn't perfect isolated. If someone says that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, their reason will be that smokers would feel uncomfortable. One thing that I suggest is setting up smoking rooms in restaurants. It is completely private room, several seat in the room.

Some restaurants separate the seats for non-smokers, but the smoke could still reach to non-smokers. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in restaurants is not allowed. Japan is too oblivious to the smoking problem. There are no good points to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't tell them to stop smoking, although I am worried about their health, as I also know how hard it is to stop smoking and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smokes said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants some non-poisonous substitute. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope some kind of substitute will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think not only for non-smokers but also for smokers."

First of all, I really hate smell of smoke. The smell is very strong and it does not go away until I take a bath and take off my clothes. It is very uncomfortable. Once the smell sticks with me, I have to be with it all day. I can't believe it. Second of all, restaurants are public places. Everyone is in there, including babies and old people who can't protect their bodies strongly. Public places should be safe. Besides, people usually have a good time with family or friends having a delicious meal and enjoying their conversations in a restaurant. Nobody can interrupt their leisure time. Smokers should put up with not smoking in restaurants, because their visit only lasts an hour or more. Last of all, smoking is nothing but poison for smokers and people around smokers. It is so harmful that it causes lung cancer. Now everyone knows it. It is like a crime to smoke in public places; it hurts people, even though the bad effect is invisible at that time. But it is certain that smoking destroys our health, so it is natural that smoking should be banned in public places."

Nowadays, almost all restaurants in Japan have two different seats. One is a seat for non-smokers, the other is a seat for smokers. When you go to a restaurant, a waiter surely asks you whether you smoke or not. So if you don't smoke or you hate cigarette smoke, you should choose a seat for non-smokers. However, in the case that you don't smoke but your husband or your friends smoke, they may choose a seat for smokers and you may put up with their smoke. In that case, you should not put up with it. You must say that you want to take a non-smoking seat. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, people who like smoking will not be willing to go to restaurant. Because of this, we should not completely ban smoking, but every restaurant should be careful about their internal environment. For example, they should place plants that keep the air fresh, or clean the air sometimes, etc. It is important for restaurants to keep their environment clean. And it is important for people who go to restaurants to say whether they want to smoke or not. For these reasons, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

First, I don't think we need to smoke in restaurants, because we go there to enjoy good dishes, not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy the taste of dishes when we smoke, because the flavor of smoke is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even if we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoking is not good for health of the non-smokers who come to a restaurant. Non-smokers must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant, even if they don’t want to. Non-smokers must lose their chance to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for growing children. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke is present and smoke is not good for the health of non-smokers, especially children."

I have two reasons to support this opinion. The first reason is for health. Under the status quo, in some restaurants, seats are divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. But even if we sit in the non-smoking area, we have to breathe smoke because it flows from one area to another. The smoke raises our risk of getting cancer. This means that it harms not only smokers, but also surrounding people. Tobacco is very bad for our health. When smoking is banned, we don't have to be afraid of breathing smoke and worry about it in the restaurant. Without health, we can't do what we want to do. Health is very important for our life. Smokers must not hurt non-smokers' health. The second reason is for us to enjoy food. Imagine, when you taste delicious food, it smells of tobacco. Then, how do you feel? Of course you pay for the food and you want to taste as much as possible, but you can't. So smoke makes you irritated and you never come to the restaurant again. What's more, the restaurant staff worked hard to cook delicious food for you. It's a very bad situation both for restaurants and customers. Like this, now, we can't fully taste food because of smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, we can always just enjoy having food. We will appreciate for the food and restaurants. It's very good for the relationship between restaurants and customers. I think restaurants should be places where we mainly enjoy eating. So as not to be interrupt our enjoyment of the food, smokers should have to smoke outside. In conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. This would benefit smokers, non-smokers and restaurant staff."

First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in the non-smoking area end up receiving the secondhand smoke. It is said that the secondhand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than firsthand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harms customers in both physical and mental ways. Second, smoking does harm to the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed, whether completely or partially. In fact, when I choose a restaurant, I try not to go to restaurants that do not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friends and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers fewer customers than if it banned smoking. This is detrimental to the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely."

There are two reasons: health problems and manners. First, smoking causes health problems. Smoking isn't good not only for a smoker's health but also for other people's health. If a smoker has disease like cancer in his lungs because of smoking, it is his responsibility. However, if a person who doesn't smoke develops lung cancer, he will want to find out why this happened. Of course, we can't know that all lung disease is caused by smokers, but there is possibility to develop lung disease in the future when someone smokes at a restaurant. Second, it is a matter of manners not to smoke in public spaces in today's Japan. Smoking makes a lot of people feel bad, so not smoking in public spaces is good manners. But, do we have to ban smoking? There is a good example. You will not do your makeup in a train because it is bad manners and it makes many people feel bad. But some people do makeup in a train even though they know it is bad manners. It is same as smoking. If we don't ban smoking clearly, some people will smoke at a restaurant in spite of knowing that many people hate it. For these two reasons, I think that smoking has to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

I'll talk about why smoking is bad for other customers. It's bad for health and enjoying food. As it is known widely, smoking is worse for secondary receivers of its smoke than for smokers themselves. There are many people affected by secondhand smoke, including, of course, children. To avoid the health problem of non-smokers and children, smoking should be banned. In addition, it's bad for eating food. In my case, I cannot enjoy eating if others smoke. I have a terrible headache when I smell smoke. How can I enjoy the food? Even if the smoking zone is separated, I can smell smoke when I go to the bathroom or something like a drink-bar. Then, as I said, I get a headache. It's a good idea to have a separate smoking zone, but it's best to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. And next, I'll tell you why it's bad for restaurants. When I see people who smoke in the restaurant, I always wonder if they enjoy the food. I think they don't. Smells and tastes are diminished by smoking. A restaurant is a place where we enjoy eating and restaurants must think they want customers to enjoy the taste of their food. If restaurants really think this way, they must ban smoking to let customers enjoy their delicious food. Smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

In my opinion, smoking should not be banned completely for two reasons. First, a smoker has a right to smoke as long as it doesn't become a nuisance to other members of the public. In the restaurant, if they make some area or tables for smokers, smoking will not trouble other people. In some public place where we can't separate non-smokers from smokers such as sidewalks in a big city or platforms at station during rush hour, I think, of course, we should ban smoking completely. But if we just set the table for smokers, there could be no problem. Actually, at many restaurants they arrange tables for both groups (smokers and non-smokers), and this is considered to be a good idea and seems to have been successful. Second, if smoking were banned completely at all restaurants, smokers would hesitate to go to restaurants. In this situation, the profit of restaurants would decrease and eventually the economy would also be negatively impacted. It is true that the number of smokers is decreasing, but there are still large numbers of people who enjoy smoking. I have a friend who smokes very often. He said that he didn't want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is banned. So, if we shut out those people from restaurants or cafés, there would be a negative impact on the Japanese economy. As I said above, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan."

To be sure, we can smoke anytime and anywhere, but smoking should be banned at public places such as restaurants. As you know, smoking is not good for our health. Generally speaking, people who smoke in daily life become sick often. For example, smokers are apt to get cancer. In fact, there is a lot of data that a number of smokers are impacted by cancer. In addition to this, the health of surrounding people is also influenced by cigarette smoke. Smoke causes illness in other people who are exposed to it. Moreover, smoke smells very bad and makes people who are near a smoker feel bad. In a restaurant, guests would like to have a good time by eating delicious dishes in comfort. However, they can't do that near smokers because smoke makes them uncomfortable. There are a lot of restaurants that set aside a space in which people can smoke. It is a very good idea and very nice for non-smokers, but I don't fully agree with the idea because people who sit beside the border between smoking and non-smoking areas are annoyed. For these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

These days, many restaurants in Japan are likely to separate the smoking area from the non-smoking area. However, some of them fail to separate them completely. This means that even if I take a table in the non-smoking area, I may smell the cigarettes from the smoking area. Cigarette smoke makes me uncomfortable, especially when I am having a meal. In my opinion, the solution to this problem is that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Moreover, smoking is bad for our health, and some studies have shown that if people smoke while they are eating, their risk of getting cancer is increased. So, the Japanese government should ban smoking at all restaurants in order to save all citizens' health. From my personal experience, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. One of my friends was able to quit smoking by the increasing number of non-smoking areas. It became harder for her to find areas where smoking is allowed. This made her smoking fewer cigarettes per day, and now she doesn't want to smoke at all anymore. Therefore, since I heard this story, I've believed that policy of smoking being banned in all restaurants makes it easier to quit smoking. That's why I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan."

I have 3 reasons mainly. Firstly, because tobacco smoke smells so bad for non-smokers, it is very irritating to endure it. Even though some restaurants have the smoking seats, smoke comes into the non-smoking area and disturb us when we are trying to enjoy the food. I always get a headache when I smell tobacco smoke, and I feel like leaving soon, even when the food is delicious. As long as smoking causes harm to others in public spaces, it should not be allowed at all. The next reason is the cost of restaurants. Because there are a lot of people who hate the smoking, restaurants have to separate the area to get customers. However, as I mentioned before, it is very difficult to separate completely and cost too much if they use high-tech solutions like air curtains. It is much better to prohibit smoking itself in all restaurants because it can be fairer with no difference between restaurants. Lastly, even for smokers, smoking in restaurants should be banned. That is because smokers cannot stop smoking by themselves but it is sure they should reduce their tobacco intake for their own health. Actually, restaurants or coffee shops are the best place for them to smoke in their daily life. If smoking is banned, surely they have to endure their cravings until they come home or they find smoking space in a station or some other space. Therefore, it can be of benefit even to smokers in a long term aspect. For these reasons, I think we should ban smoking completely at all restaurants."

Certainly, smoking is bad for one’s health. There is scientific evidence and everyone knows this fact. Above all, non-smokers dislike smoking. Though I do not smoke, we have a choice whether we smoke or not. We have a right to do things freely. Many smokers may relieve stress by smoking. I would feel sorry for them if smoking was banned, because they would lose their way to relieve stress. Smoking is banned in public. Now, in Japan some restaurants have smoking seats and non-smoking seats, and others have only non-smoking seats. If smoking is banned more, people will smoke only their houses. Non-smoking areas are increased this way. But, recently cigarettes have been sold not only at tobacconists but also at convenience stores. In fact, tax on cigarettes helps the Japanese government. Nevertheless, banning smoking in many places is a mistake. It is not only smokers who are bad. The Japanese government has the responsibility to solve a problem. Though it is a very difficult issue, it is not natural that only smokers are blamed. Also, non-smokers have to try to be patient and understand smokers, and smokers have to be careful about their manners when they smoke."

Especially at restaurants, people who don't smoke may think that they want to taste their dishes without being impacted by smoke. Moreover, nowadays the number of people who don't smoke is increasing in Japan. In other words, the number of people who don't want to take their seats near smokers in restaurants is growing. Therefore, restaurants that do not ban smoking may lose their customers who don't smoke. For example, if there are two restaurants, one in which smoking is completely banned to smoke and the other in which smoking is permitted, I will choose the one that completely bans smoking because I hate smoke in restaurants. People who love smoking should go to cigar bars, not to restaurants. Both restaurants and bars can continue to attract their customers. In addition, I think that making smoking and non-smoking areas costs restaurants a lot of money. They must prepare some equipment to divide the two areas and the clerks must spend their time to do so and to ask their customers which area they prefer. To ban smoking is good for both customers and restaurants."

Smoking in restaurants has two bad effects. One is that smell of smoking is bad for our enjoyment of food. For example, we can't enjoy the smell of foods if there are people who are smoking in the restaurant. Smell is an important part of food. We enjoy foods by not only their taste but also their smell. Smell can make foods good, or otherwise it can make foods bad. The other bad effect is that smoke is bad for one’s health. In restaurants, there are a lot of people: babies, children, teens, adults, and the elderly. Smoking has a bad influence on them all. Smoking is bad for health of all people, especially for babies and pregnant women. Smokers don't have the right to cause health problems for others. Smoking has these two bad effects.

Certainly, many people who don't smoke don't want to eat next to smokers. I agree with this thinking. But by banning smoking at a restaurant, smokers won’t go there to eat and drink. Banning smoking has two bad effects. First, when smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smokers cannot eat out. Then they can't eat something in their favorite restaurants. It makes them unhappy. And when smokers don't eat in restaurants, the number of guests who comes to restaurants will be less than ever. Then the profit of the restaurant will decrease. I think that this is very inconvenient for the restaurant, so I disagree that smoking should be completely banned. But we should consider people who don't smoke. Therefore, I think that smoking should be partially banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants should have some space where people can smoke and some space where people can not smoke. By doing that, both of non-smokers and smokers can enjoy their meals. So I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, but I agree that it should be partially banned."

Recently in more and more restaurants, smoking has been completely banned in Japan, however there are still two kinds of seats, smoking and non-smoking, in some restaurants. I am not a smoker, so I will choose the non-smoking seats. But even if I sit in those seats, I often feel bad because of the flowing smell of smoke. The smell of the cigarette is very strong. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, I have heard that secondhand cigarette smoke is much worse than firsthand smoke. That means that smoking has a worse effect on non-smokers at a restaurant than smokers. I think it is unfair for non-smokers. I think smokers should smoke outside of a restaurant or in one smoker's room. It is fair and reasonable. Smoking is bad for your health. I am sure that we have to discuss good or bad points of smoking before thinking about banning smoking at restaurants.

I would like to show you three reasons. The first reason is that restaurants should be places where you enjoy food, not smoke. Restaurants serve you very nice and special food. You can enjoy beautiful food with all your senses like seeing, smelling and tasting. But smoke can harm this very happy time. You cannot enjoy the appearance of food due to smoke. You cannot savor good smells due to smoke. You might not understand the real taste due to smoke. Cigarette smoke prevents you from enjoying a nice meal. Secondly, I want to mention that most of the people who don't smoke really hate smoke, especially when they have meals. People who don't smoke are more sensitive to smoke and the smell of cigarettes than smokers. Restaurants are different from outside places that can push away smoke and get fresh air. People cannot enjoy their dinner due to smoke. Finally, the third reason is that your smoking can harm other people who want to avoid bad effects on their health. People who are concerned about their health cannot help breathing smoke. For these three reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country."

This is because that smokers have the right to do what they want to do, as other people who are not smokers also have this right. Of course, I disagree that smokers should smoke whenever and wherever they want to. And I also disagree that smokers should be smoking when they are walking or working. Some people who think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country may say that smoking is very harmful and bad for the health of the smoker and the people around him, and I think that they are right. In fact, I don't like smokers very much. But I think that completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is too strict for smokers. I also think that a complete smoking ban in restaurants is not fair for smokers. So, I think that at least some spaces where smokers can smoke freely should be made at all the restaurants in the country. This is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoke-filled air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separate smoking and non-smoking sections, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section where you sit. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke. For example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking seat if the section is full. In this case, they have to take seats in the smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot completely prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke. Even if smoking and non-smoking sections are separate, the two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus, non-smokers are not perfectly guarded from smoke-filled air. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are separate smoking and non-smoking sections in a restaurant, it does not help the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think about trying to stop smoking. It is very good for their health to stop smoking. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement."

Smokers have the right to smoke, but non-smokers also have the right not to smoke at the same time. But the non-smoker's right is lighter than smoker's. Smokers can smoke almost everywhere at any time. Despite the fact that smokers can control their desire for a short time like during class, if they want to smoke, they can go to a smoking place soon after eating a meal. It is hard for a non-smoker to say “don’t smoke” to them, and non-smokers have non-smoking places. Smoking causes many diseases like cancer, heart diseases, etc. Even smokers don't want to have these diseases. They don't want to get sick and are afraid of death after falling ill. But people don't stop smoking. One reason is the Japanese environment. People can get cigarettes easily and cheaply and can smoke almost everywhere. The Japanese government hasn’t forbidden smoking. They don't try to reduce smoking rates or announce that smoking is dangerous for one's health. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers would lose one chance, one place for smoking, and some smokers may quit smoking. It would be evidence that smoking is bad for one's health so the government banned it, and non-smoker could enjoy their meals."

I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, because of the bad smell, people cannot enjoy eating at restaurants. Recently, in most restaurants, smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, but it is impossible to shut out the smoke and bad smell completely. So some people who don't smoke have to endure the bad smell from the smoking area while eating. Because of the smell of smoke, sometimes the smell or taste of food is changed. In order to keep the quality of food and people's rights to enjoy eating, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Secondly, smoke is bad for our health. It causes many kinds of disease, like lung cancer. For smokers it is totally voluntary to take this risk, but non-smokers also have to breathe in smoke at restaurants for the reasons stated above. Moreover, secondhand smoke includes more dangerous substances than firsthand smoke. Especially in restaurants, people often take their babies and children, and smoke has really bad effect for their physical development. We need protect people around smokers from smoke in public spaces. Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan."

The main reason is that smoking is harmful not only for smokers but also for non-smokers. There are two types of tobacco smoke: firsthand smoke and secondhand smoke. The former is absorbed by smokers and the latter passively by non-smokers. If smokers have bad manners, smoke floats into the air. At first, restaurants are places where people gather and enjoy eating. The food tastes and smells good. If smoke is present in the restaurant, it reduces the dishes’ taste by half. Although people have the freedom to smoke, they may not harm others’ enjoyment of their meals. In fact, smoking has been banned from 10:00 to 14:00 on holidays in the doughnut shop where I work for a year. The is the peak time when people gather. I feel that more families with children come to the shop compared with before. It shows that more people dislike smoking. All people can enjoy meals equally at any time in any place. In Europe, most countries ban smoking in restaurants. Following Europe, it needs to be banned in Japan too."

There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are more strongly affected by tobacco smoke than adults, and research has revealed that people exposed to secondhand smoke are more harmed than smokers themselves. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smokers can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to restaurants. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by this become interested in smoking. In spite of being under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants that people can enter with their pets, for example, dog cafés. Not only to humans but also to dogs, smoking may do harm. This is why I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

There are three reasons why I agree. First, people who smoke everyday often suffer from poor health. For example, they might feel tired all the time and even develop cancer. If this happens to you, you can't live with happiness. It is a very serious problem. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smokers feel bad, and they also suffer bad effects. The smell of cigarette smoke is bad for non-smokers. They can't fully enjoy eating dinner. In addition, second-hand smoke is more dangerous for non-smokers than first-hand smoke is for smokers. It is a more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smokers’ manners are bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw their butts on the ground. It is also a serious problem for other people. Some people might say that people in developing countries get money from making cigarettes. This is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs will not be needed. However, a job making someone’s health bad is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better to buy things other than cigarettes. It is good for you, and other people.

Cigarettes have a lot of bad effects on both smokers and non-smokers. First, restaurants are places that everyone enjoys eating and talking with his or her friends. Everyone should be happy in restaurants. Smokers may be happy to smoke. But non-smokers must be not happy, because even if they don't smoke, they have to breathe cigarette smoke. Even there is only one smoking person, the smoke spreads all over the room in restaurants. In my case, I don't like smoke and the smell of cigarettes, so if someone smokes in restaurants, I don't want to eat there. Second, smoking during eating is not good manners. At least during eating, smokers should stop smoking. Non-stop smoking is not only bad manners, but can also become a killer. This means that cigarettes may lead to diseases in both smokers and non-smokers. The disease of particular concern is cancer. Cancer is one of the more difficult diseases, because it often reappears, and if the cancer is too bad, the person may die. As you know from these examples, cigarettes give only bad effects to people. That is why I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country."

First, it is painful for people who don't smoke to have dinner in the restaurant. They often have a worse experience when people are smoking. Some people say, “We don't have to ban smoking in the restaurants. It is enough to make the non-smoking seats.” It may be better than if there were no non-smoking seats, but we can't say it is enough. Because smoke really can go everywhere in the restaurants, people who don't smoke are still exposed to smoke. The managers in restaurants should be more careful for their guests to enjoy having their dinner. Second, smoking makes restaurants dirty. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant and guests can smoke everywhere in the restaurant. After the guests go back home, I clean up the room. Then, I always find that there is a lot of ash on the tatami. It is really hard to clean. I also find the color of walls is getting a little yellow. I can't believe there are people who don't hesitate to make the room dirty. They are guests, but it is natural that they should have good manners."

I think this because smoking does harm not only to the smoker but also to people around him or her. It goes without saying that smoke is gas. Though we can separate seats, we cannot separate gas. If a smoker sits in a smoking section, and you sit in a non-smoking section near him in a restaurant, the more he smokes, the more smoke you take. In addition, we can reduce the costs and time if smoking is banned. Restaurants will not need to buy and clean ashtrays. You may say that this is too strict for smokers, but if they really want to smoke, they should go to a smoking room that stops the gas from leaking out. I believe this idea sounds very nice for both smokers and non-smokers. And these days, the number of people who smoke is reducing in Japan. The price of smoke is getting higher and higher, and it is troublesome to get even a pack of cigarettes in Japan. Then, how about eliminating cigarettes? They simply do not have any good aspects. They just harm our health. In one of the ways we can help eliminate cigarettes, we can get rid of the smoking sections in restaurants in Japan."

And I don't agree with the statement that smoking is a personal habit. For example, smoking is the worst. Smoking damages not only a smoker’s body but also the bodies of people around the smoker. This effect is called “secondhand smoke”. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that moves from a smoker to other persons around the smoker. Allowing secondhand smoke to affect others is bad manners, especially in crowded common areas such as parks, stations, airports and streets, because this smoke causes health problems such as asthma and lung cancer in others. Lung cancer is the worst sickness. This sickness's mortality rate is high and a lot of Japanese people have been killed by it. Smoking has a strong relationship to lung cancer, and many scientists think that smoking causes lung cancer. So I think smoking should be completely banned in places where many people are."

There is a prevailing opinion that since a restaurant is a place to eat, it shouldn't be covered with cigarette smoke, in order not to spoil the food. This opinion sounds valid, but who in the world made a rule that foods should always be eaten in clean places? Actually, this opinion is held by people who do not smoke, who are in the majority. How about the opinions of people who want to smoke while eating? Also, from the point of view of diversity, I think there can be some people who smoke. A world where everyone is behaving the same will just be boring. People smoking look somewhat cool. There's also an opinion referring to the bad effects smoking causes to your health, but I think just a few minutes being exposed to smoke while you eat won't give you a fatal effect, unless you go and eat at restaurants about twenty times a week. But for my real opinion, I don't really care whether people smoke at restaurants or not, because I don't go to restaurants so often. Many people must be the same. There are many cooking books you can buy at bookstores, and you can make meals tasty enough by yourself."

First, when we breathe the smoke, we sometimes cough or develop a sore throat. That is a bad thing for us. Second, the smell of smoke is very bad. Some people may think that everyone should tolerate the smell, because smoking gives smokers refreshment like a drink makes people refreshed. So, they think smoking in restaurants is not a bad thing. However, there is a serious problem in smoking: cigarette smoke contains many harmful products like nicotine. Such products are said to cause cancer. Moreover, they harm not only smokers but also people near them. Smoking gives us not so much refreshment as illness. In Japan, smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats in many restaurants, but they are not completely separated. When we sit in the non-smoking seats, smoke comes into the area and we breathe in harmful substances. That makes no means to separate the seats. Japanese restaurants sometimes have enough space, so I think it difficult to separate them completely. If smoking were banned in every restaurant, we would have no trouble with smoking. So, stores like restaurants should ban smoking."

I think it’s better to have some place in restaurants in which smokers can smoke. However, I dislike cigarette smoke and there are small children and babies in restaurants, so I want to completely separate the seats of smokers from the seats of nonsmokers. Recently, companies or department stores, for example, have smoking rooms. Smokers can smoke only in the room. I think this is a very good trend. Smokers can smoke in the room and nonsmokers are protected from smoke. Smoking is very bad not only for smokers’ health but also for nonsmokers’ health. Nowadays, there is also a cigarette tax. The number of places where smokers can smoke is getting smaller and smaller. Therefore, I hope that the number of smokers will gradually decrease.

Business at restaurants will decrease. Second, smoking does not always cause trouble. Actually, some people don't like others smoking. But establishing separate smoking areas will solve the problem. It enables those who want to smoke to smoke and those who don’t want to smoke to avoid others smoking. Third, I think there is no merit to banning smoking at all restaurants in Japan. All problems about smoking, except about health, are sufficiently addressed by establishing separate smoking areas, and what need is there to do more? Nothing is needed. But more needs to be done in establishing separate smoking areas. We have to be more careful to divide smoking areas, not to ban smoking. What can be done at restaurant is limited.

But, smokers have rights and freedom of choice when it comes to smoking. Only forbidding smoking doesn’t make smokers’ smoking manners better. Of course, non-smokers’ health is really important. Smoking without manners will cause a lot of conflict. I have some ideas to solve this problem. First, distinguish smoking and non-smoking seats more strictly. Almost all restaurants, of course, distinguish them already. But, most restaurants distinguish them only by space. I think that this is not enough. I propose that restaurants separate these places by walls. By doing this, smokers can smoke as they please, and non-smokers don't have to worry about the damage to their health caused by the smoke. It doesn't have to take much tax; only a little will work. Second, increase the tax on cigarettes. If smokers need more money for smoking, they will reduce their smoking a little more, at least, in restaurants.

I'm going to write why I think this way by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation. Now, imagine that all the restaurants in the country ban smoking. As many of you know, smoking gives us nothing good, especially when it came to medical field. Tobacco smoke contains a lot of chemicals and some of them cause lung cancer. In addition, it has turned out that the smoke does more harm to those who are around the smoker than it does to the smoker himself. Therefore, if there's nobody to smoke in a restaurant, it means that nobody is exposed to the danger of taking the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. I think this is an advantage of banning smoking in restaurants. Some people might want to smoke, even in restaurants. Those people might not come to restaurants as they used to do, since they are never allowed to smoke in the restaurants. Decreasing the number of the customers can affect the financial state of restaurants, and have a negative economic influence. This is a disadvantage of banning smoking in restaurants. It is true that some people can feel that they cannot do without cigarettes. However, I think such people are already addicted to smoking. What they should do is not smoke in a restaurant and risk the health of both other people's and theirs; they should consult their doctor. In the first place, restaurant should be a place where people enjoy their meals. Therefore, I think banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is really a good idea."

Second, I think the most serious problem is that smoking at a restaurant makes people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are the times that all people enjoy eating and relaxing, and a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relaxing. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not a private place but a public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke, but I think that smoking in a restaurant is bad manners. For the enjoyment of all the people, everyone should stop smoking. Therefore, all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking is banned in more places day by day.

I dislike smoking for the reasons that it smells bad and is dirty. Smoking is very bad for the smoker's health and is troublesome to other people. Restaurants are mainly places for eating, so smoking around people who are eating is very bad for the atmosphere, as well as the smell and taste of the food. It is important for the dish to taste good, have a good smell, and for the atmosphere to be good. Tobacco has a bad smell which is harmful for humans and a smoke which is a white and grey gas. There are many children in restaurants. Tobacco smoke is very bad for children. Moreover, tobacco smoke soaks through children’s clothes. If someone smokes in a restaurant, we cannot wear new clothes. We must be aware of this. Smokers should stop smoking in restaurants as early as they can, and they will be healthy in the future. If they die early because of smoking, their family will be very sad. They will regret that he didn’t stop smoking. Therefore, people who smoke tobacco should stop smoking in the restaurant, and I think that smoking in a restaurant should be a crime."

Some students in universities want money for their education. Most of these students don't have enough money for learning, so part-time jobs help them waste less money. Some students want money for buying something they want. That's a good thing because it means they don't use their parent's money for things they prefer and that these things were meant for them. I can see that part-time jobs have many benefits. But on the other hand, there aren't many part-time jobs that are good. There are also jobs that are dangerous for students; especially, for girls. For example, some girls are waitresses in pubs. Of course, it's very dangerous for innocent girls. But these kinds of jobs can give them a lot of money fast. Even though they work in a restaurant, if you have bad friends, there are terrible things waiting for you. So many parents won't let their children have part-time jobs. But I think that everything has its own pros and cons, so it's up to anyone to choose. The most important thing, everybody should have their own thoughts and do anything you think is the best way. But don't forget to ask your parents and trust them because they know exactly the best thing for you."

The addition of recurring revenue. This is the main reason people often choose to work extra part-time jobs, which are a part-time job that has to do in the labor market, most often pay wages sensitivity and high yield. Wanting to resolve the financial problems as well. Part-time jobs use free time to benefit as income. Creating positive work habits. About time management for maximum benefit. Rather than let life pass from day to day with nonsense, because for each day we have at least 8 hours that always have time left unfortunately. We can work part-time or extra work is just part=time on Sat or Sun to generate extra income for families. On the other hand, generations of IT workers work part-time on the Internet. This happens a lot. Can be doing at home. Work your own schedule. To have more time with family. Because after that deal with everyday life is complete the remaining time than one can rest but can also allocate time to part-time work has continued as well. Another advantage of extra or part-time students get to practice before real work in the future. Many people who have worked extra have work experience when applying for jobs are often considered for work before others. This is due to the recruitment company. They do not want to start new training sure enough. In addition, money and experience can't find the part-time work. Part-time working is also helping to be patient, responsible, and honest. Finally, you will get the trust of parents and become adults to work effectively in the future."

That method is a part-time job after school. Teenagers are trained about science and theories at school, but it is not enough to prepare them for adult life. Parents must think about a way to make them be older, tougher, and understand the wider world by the encouraging them to take a part-time job. Once in a while I indulge and spoil myself with something expensive. Since I was working, my mother declared that she was cutting off my allowance. When she was still giving me allowance, the phrase spending money like water was all too familiar with me. There was this a little store in the mall called Sanrio Surprises where all my money would flow. Anything new there was what I invested my precious allowance in. It did not even matter what it was or how I was going to get it. I just had to get it no matter what. The best reason for encourage teenagers to take a part-time job is to make them learn how hard it is to earn money."

Some people do it to find a new experience or find new salary to use. They have many reasons to do a part-time job. In my opinion, I think do a part-time job is good for everyone, because we find new kinds of experiences and give ourselves to know how hard it is to find money and teach me the value of money. We could find a new friend when you are doing a part-time job. Part-time jobs make me more conscious and sociable. It is like training before going out into the real world. Another reason is they want to save money to buy the gadgets or clothes, shoes, and the others on his own. In my opinion doing a part-time job like this way is good. Because you use your money to buy things that you want. This way helps your parents save money. Nevertheless, doing a part-time job in my opinion is only utility and it cannot harm you. It only makes you stronger and stronger."

Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students do it for the experience, to make money, or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students do a part-time job it will have effect their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. Some students cannot arrange their time and get bad grades. They should not do a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for the right time; for example, summer holiday or in their free time. They should keep time for study and read book. Moreover, part-time jobs have good points also. The students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parents and save money for their family. When they need something they can buy it by themselves and they don't have to disturb their parents. Whatever the part-time jobs are not important for college students because students must learn and grow up. Jobs will make students grow over as they age. If college students have problems with money to study then they can request scholarships. Today there are many scholarships for poor and good students. I think scholarships are better than college students to have a part-time job."

Teenagers who work part-time jobs can practice to be careful when they meet many kinds of people. They will know benefits of money and how hard it is to earn it. I agree with a part-time job. The first reason is part-time jobs can help teenagers prepare for adult life and must have more responsibility. When teenagers take a part-time job must be responsible to manage time for study, relax, work, and travel. Next, teenagers can learn how to live with other people and adjust to unfamiliar environments. Third, teenagers learn what they want in the future. They can plan what they have to learn that will be useful for their future jobs. Finally, teenagers will know the benefits of money, how hard it is to earn it. I think that no one wants to waste money that they have in exchange of their efforts. In conclusion, part-time jobs are a good idea to prepare teenagers to be adults. I hope that schools or universities and parents will support young people to work part-time jobs."

Somebody kills time by going shopping or traveling and all activities lose time but if you get a job in a shop or restaurant earning your own money. Second, it can improve your skills if you only have a small social circle and can accommodate so the job would help you to meet new many kinds of people and this might be good for you. Third it improves patience and can make you grow up. The job might be hard sometimes or not comfortable; but if you can do it that would be great. Fourth, you are in college, which means you are not a little child. A part-time job can help your parents and you would be proud of yourself that you can earn your own pocket money by your own two hands. In other words, your mother would not reprove you any more about your new shirt or new shoes. The last reason some learners do not have much time to exercise so a job would help you move your body and use your brain, which results is good health. I think it is a good way to spend your time is with a past-time job and don't forget to study hard, too."

The benefits of having part time jobs are as follows. Firstly, students have extra money for school. Students can help their family by supporting themselves by earning money from their part time job. There are some places where students can do part time jobs when they are free during the week or weekend such as cinemas, food shops, etc. Many students can have income as college students and that is very good because they will be very proud of themselves. The extra money can also support their family because some of them may have some financial problems. Many students have to drop out of school because they must help themselves. Second, of course gaining experience is important. Presently, many companies require students to have experience, so a student that has experience is better than an inexperienced student is. The last benefit is making new friends. This is a small part but I think it's interesting to have new friends in a part time job. We can share our knowledge and share other experiences. We learn about and understand each other. It makes us more friendly and easygoing. So I think there are not only these three points, but many good points to having a part time job."

A part time job will teach you what you should do when you are part of a company and it will teach you how to change yourself to be like others. A part time job also teaches you an important thing, which is that you must come on time, because time is an important thing in the world of work. If you come to work late, it means you are a serious problem to your organization, so time is the most important thing and you cannot disagree that a part time job is important for college students because experience will be gained by performing. It's not gained by trading or shopping, so experiences are similar to the golden boxes that you have to find and finding them fills your box, but the box of experiences does not fill in one day, experience can increase anytime and anywhere you want it to. Last, a part time job is important for college students, because it can make you become a perfect person."

It is stated like that because we don't have to do it, unlike serious stuff like studying. I think having a job is important but I will suggest to someone that wants to work a part time job not to overdo it, though working is necessary to gain experience before graduating from university. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students, and many college towns deliberately tailor their openings for students. Students don't have a lot of hope for the future, except that it won't get worse. I support that if we want to help our families and have extra money we have to do a part time job. For example, if parents pay 5000 baht per month, and we have to pay 2500 baht for the dormitory, we have only 2500 baht to spend. We have to eat and pay for many things. We shouldn't ask parents for more. We should find a job to reduce the money we get from parents. They will be too tired to work because they are old."

It is important because sometimes they have more free time that can be spent doing a part time job. Not only can they spend free time in a good way but also it is one way to prepare for adult life, such as by dealing with many strange people, developing their personality, and learning how to take responsibility for what they have done. A part time job can train them how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that as a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not use the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore, or if the kids can give the parents the money they earn, their parents will be very happy. Last, in my opinion a part time job is good for students who have more free time but it should not affect our studies."

Although each job is different, such as sales worker, etc., what comes through is a valuable experience not available in the classroom. Today, finding new graduates is difficult for most companies and they work hard to find individuals with experience. To have work experience in time with finishing University is important to students. Students then will not have less experience. To find work during school is a job for a lot of people. They may be employed through the university or find a supplier by themselves. An example of working part time is service at 7-Eleven. From the expertise of working in your career, you learn human relationships and learn to correct errors and self-development. Therefore, we say that experience from work has value depending on the students themselves working hard. They get experience from working much. Students have many different reasons to want to work, like money to do something for leisure. In conclusion, experiences by working part time are important things to get  knowledge of self and human relationships with colleagues. They learn about working hours and break time, knowledge and expertise in that line all to improve and develop their own following."

All students think having a part-time job is very interesting because we can have our own money and a part-time job can help us manage time and not waste time in the dormitory playing games or chatting online and sleeping in bed. If we have a part-time job at university I think it can help us for our future careers because we can manage time and service. A part-time job is very important for all students but it can damage us if we cannot manage time for both studying and a job.

It also is a good time to benefit because most students may not be as well off. It depends on money at home and working part time is part of helping alleviate the burden from home and training to recognize their responsibility. Money is for saving and some students of China want to be different and buy things not just with money at home, and some students merely sleep in rooms. I think finding jobs at department stores or facilities gives them time to practice the benefits of their own saving in a time of need. Working part time, we will more or less know the responsibility of having to work, but a student must see if work done manually is appropriate or not. If work is not appropriate to them it will result in bad or abusive work. Part time jobs that are both heavy and light have both advantages and disadvantages, and if a student is interested in part time work, too much may result in lessons. Working part time, because most of the work is very late, results in no time to read books and rest.

Students have to have the patience and diligence for working and studying. Some students may agree that a part time job is necessary for life but somehow it's optional to choose. There are many reasons for having a part time job such as earning money, gaining experiences, or expanding networking. Some part time jobs pay a lot of money to students while some jobs paying very little. Personally, I think having a part time job depends on personal reasons. If I have more time and I want to buy something expensive, I may look for a part time job so that I can buy that thing by myself. Having a part time job while studying is not popular in Thailand. We are supported by our families and they always state that we should focus on studying only.

Our fathers and mothers will be happy if we can get money by ourselves. When I spend money that I have from work, I feel happy because it is my money. The money that my father and mother give to me I save and use to pay for studying. Work also helps me to be strong and adult. I know what to decide when I have problems at work.

First of all, the students that have a part-time job can get some money to share in the work of their family and they can develop many important skills to become a good worker, such as responsibility, punctuality, and self-command. They also learn how to work with other people and gain much experience from older workers. Most importantly, when college students graduate and want to find a job, the students who had a part-time job in the past are more interesting than the others who did not. Especially, for the students that had many part-time jobs for many years, it's proof of their diligence. However, some students who have part-time jobs brush away learning on campus. They must remember that the reason why they are students is to learn to find good work in the future.

Second, if we look at another side, we will see that a part-time job is good for some students who have less money. Nowadays, in college, they usually finish class early and they do not have to study all day like students in high school. Therefore, it is easy if they want to get a part-time job, and I think it is a good idea for college students to have part-time jobs because they can get lessons from outside the classroom. This is sometimes better than just sitting and studying in school or college, and they can also get life experience. Finally, I think part-time jobs might teach them many things. For example, it can help them to manage time in daily life, train themselves to have responsibility, always be on time, spend free time usefully, help with their expenses, learn how to use and keep money and lastly, and help their thinking process or how to fix a problem they face."

Some departments of the student's college are hard to graduate from and get good grades. This is because the student may spend much time or share time when they are not at college, such as weekends, holidays, long holidays, Sundays, etc. They might divide time properly and spend time together with other people such as friends, teachers, or in other places. In my opinion, having a part-time job in Thailand is not important for every college student. The students should do main tasks and there are many activities to do in the student's life before having a part-time job. If you have some free time, you may do a part-time job. I think just doing activities in the student's department and college is enough for the college student so it is not necessary to have a part-time job as a college student. A part-time job can be done anytime but tasks and activities in college may only be done once or at a certain time. Part-time work may make you waste your effective progress in college."

A part time job is a good thing to do during free time especially as college students because they have more free time and freedom to do anything that they want. In my opinion, a part time job is a good thing to do and I think it is important for college students because they have much free time to do that and it will be a good experience for them. Though there are many activities to do at their universities and each activity will give them good experience, it is not enough if they have problems with money, so if they want to get more income a part time job is very important for people in this group. I have another reason that supports my opinion that a part time job is important for college students. It is that we can help our parents by reducing what they pay if we have income from a part time job. A part time job is maybe not important for someone who is very rich but it is a good chance to make new experiences, and if you do it and get income by yourself, that will make you so proud of yourself."

Students have time out of the classroom to read, play sports, games, shop, and relax. Most students who work need money. What people want is to collect money to buy equipment, jewelry, clothing, sports stuff, phones, portable computers, wool caps, or tennis shoes. Helping students to work for compensation will enable students to think for hours and hours depending on how much they work or how easy or difficult it is. Therefore, students need to have a part-time job to meet demands. They can make money by themselves and for the experience of working with students in higher education. Before, students were responsible for only to having a quality personality in school. So many people look at college as an opportunity to socialize, to find themselves, and to explore the world before going out into it. College has been defined as a ""safe place for young people to grow."" Some students don't know the value of work experience and how it can enhance the educational experience. At least one semester of work would benefit ALL students."

There are many things to do and the best one is a part time job. It is good for students to have a part time job because it will make the students get more experiences, students will earn money, and they may have opportunities to get a job in future. First, it is good for students to have part time jobs because students will get more experiences. When students have to do their jobs, they will face many situations with consumers and their boss. They will have more patience and learn more about living with others in society. Second, students will earn more money while they are learning. Part time jobs make money for students too. Students will know the value of money and how hard they must work to find it. From this, they will know how to use money and they will have money if they have to use it. Finally, another reason why it is good for students to have a part time job is they might get more opportunities to work in the future. If students work, they will meet many people. In addition, if the agency finds that this student is good at working, they can remember their name and promise this student the job when they graduate. All in all, students might strongly believe that doing a part time job is necessary and important because a part time job can give more experiences, make money, and provide more opportunities for students in the future."

It is interesting, because it is experience. It is outside of your class. You learn something. A job is a good activity because you get strange experiences and you can make money. My opinion about part time jobs for students is that the government should support them very much because it is a good activity. They spend time in a good way and get many benefits like learning about social relationships, taking care of other people, knowing what other people want, trying to serve them happily, etc. It is a process of training students to be adults. They will learn from the managers and friends in the workplace. For example, if a customer complains about the company, how do they deal with it? Some customers may be unkind and ask for many things. It helps with how to keep patient and try to calm down. When trying to calm down, they must know solutions. Therefore, I think students, when they have a part time job, can be like adults learning how to work and deal with people."

The only time to be used is there. They cannot take all of it to dedicate to work because most of the time it will be mainly studying. Today, part-time work enables students to lose great learning because students are divided into less time to learn to work. Sometimes they claim they are tired from working so they do not want to learn. There is no time to study if they work, but working part-time is not considered damaging. It is useful time as well. The practice itself is the experience itself. Part-time work is used in everyday life and is considered beneficial in helping alleviate their burden because their parents do not have to interfere with their money. When students have a personal problem or need for money, they do not have to ask their parents, and working part time is considered to allow us to recognize the value of money in that the money came hard. It will not come easy to exchange many things and sacrifice their own personal time in exchange for money. Also, we know that parents have money from hard work. Therefore, we have learned that we should help parents save their money and think about our obligation to send money. Let us learn as much as their love gave us. Finally, work is considered part-time by students, but is helpful to souls who share the correct time and select the appropriate work for their studies will not affect their courses and does not affect our health, and will not cause trouble if it can be a good thing in the lives of students."

There are many kinds of work that college students like such as being a server, cashier, etc. Do you think it is necessary for college students? If you ask me about having a part-time job when you study in college, I can think of both sides, good and bad things. If you talk about the families that are not rich enough to spend money on studying in college, I think working part-time is important. When you study in college, you can only just learn and learn but if you don't have enough money for eating, living, or buying books, you must have a part-time job for this thing. In other words, if you have enough money for everything, I think a part-time job is unnecessary for you because when you work a part-time job you will not have much time for rest, reading books, or working on your homework. If you want to work a part-time job, you must manage your time for everything you have to do first. If you have much free time, you can work on a part-time job. When you manage everything clearly, I think part-time work will give you more experience for working and you will have more money for shopping."

The costs of studying in universities are rising as well. These costs include semester fees, registration for credits, transportation fees, meals, and so on. Some students who left their houses to study far away or in different provinces have to pay for renting rooms in apartments, which cost more than what the students who come back home every day pay. The burden of this goes on to their parents to earn more money, not only to feed their children but also to send their children to study higher education. A part-time job is one of the options that college students can choose to relieve the burdens of their parents. Thus, college students have to make the decision to choose a part-time job that is appropriate for their studying time because they have to study hard along with working. A part-time job that is related to their studies will be more advantageous for them, but sometimes those kinds of jobs are quite rare. Therefore, many college students do not have many choices to choose for work. Anyway, students have to get part-time jobs to earn money for taking care of themselves and save their parents' money. A part-time job for college students now has become very important for those who want to help their parents and earn experience while they are working. Sometimes the experiences they receive are worth enough for their futures. Although some college students are not in trouble with all the costs, they are eager to work to earn experience and get money to buy things they need."

One thing that I can say is part-time jobs have two sides to them. On the positive side, it will give you experience in life. An example is when you have some problems, it will teach you what should you do to solve those problems, even if you might not like your job. Then, you will know if the kind of job that you took is your style or not. It that way, it teaches you how you can find a pleasing job in the future! On the negative side, you must study and work at the same time and that can cause you so many problems. Your grades may drop if you take yourself to the job too much, or problems with your studies can make you worry when you work, so you cannot work as well as you should. However, some people can manage it! They know how to use their time in their life, not only for a part-time job and studying but also for their friends, family, or maybe their boyfriend or girlfriend. Not everybody can do that, however, so you cannot say that having a part-time job when you're still studying is good. Thinking about this case is up to the person. You can say that it is good or bad but there is no true answer. The answer is something that you must find out yourself."

Right now the economy in Thailand isn't good at all, and many people get laid off from their jobs and it is also hard to find a job even if you're a bachelor's degree student. A job at McDonald's or some restaurants doesn't make a lot of money but at least you can get experiences, which are more valuable than money. If you compare a student who has been working and has experience to another student who hasn't been working nor has any experience, I think the one who worked will have more opportunities. It's also helpful to his or her family. Using their time wisely and not wasting time by getting a job is much better. Many students get a better life from doing part time work after school. We should not wait for help from others. We must help ourselves first, and then we will be strong and ready to fight any difficult thing after graduating from university. Parents won't worry about us and they will watch over our steps to becoming successful in the future on our own. I want to see Thai students survive by themselves not just wait for their parents help."

Are you one of the students who have a part-time job? What do you think about it? Nowadays, there are a lot of college students who have a part-time job. Some people question its importance for students. In my opinion, three major benefits of college students having a part-time job are getting work experience, saving parents' money, and using free time usefully. First, a part-time job is a way to internship. This is an important factor because in the future, when they graduate, the students must get work. If they had a part-time job before, they would do better than others would because they have more experience than others do. Experience is one of the most important factors that are necessary in a person's life. Saving parents' money is the second benefit of a part-time job. With the money that they get at a part-time job, students do not have to use their parent's money. They can help their parents reduce expenses and they can save money to use in the future. Third, nowadays most students use their free time to play games and use the internet, listen to music, etc. That is useless, but if they had a part-time job, they will use free time usefully. In conclusion, a part-time job has three benefits: it trains students for work in the future, the student can save their parents' money because they have an income, and they will change their useless free time into useful time. If Thai students can do these, how many benefits will Thailand get?"

For me, among the members of my family we have no one who is a smoker. My father always tells us that it is bad and I really trust him. Do you think that drugs are good? Of course not. In the case of something such as tea or coffee, which are drugs too, they don't destroy our health as much as smoking. I don't think that it's a good idea. Some people say that although they are relaxed, their bodies are being destroyed by the thing that they think is good for them. I think if somebody is serious, exercising might help them more than smoking. Do you think that too? For an easy example, if you are very hungry, and there is a poison apple and ingredients for apple pie in front of you, what would you choose? The clever people will choose the ingredients for apple pie, right? Although it might take time to bake a pie and you want to eat an apple, you know that if you eat a poison apple, you will die after you get full. Thus, you must choose the slower but better one. In addition, between exercising or playing sports and smoking, the stupid people always choose the faster one. They do not care about results, they know just that they are very hungry and they want to eat an apple right now. Trust me, in the future, they will feel sorry about what they've done. Lastly, I know that everybody has their own rights, so I can't forbid anyone from smoking, but hopefully they will learn someday that a poison apple is not good for them and that there are many people who love them and don't want them to destroy themselves."

Youths are at risk of smoking addictions and the risks tend to be much higher each year. When they smoke cigarettes, they then stick to it until they die. It is not easy to quit, so young people should learn and realize the danger of smoking and help to solve the problem by themselves by maybe beginning to learn before, such as about the harm of smoking. Maybe they can learn from books, media, the Internet, or asking teachers as well as those who have knowledge of using leisure time usefully. Probably like playing sports like football, table tennis, or a running style that would generate such a beneficial use of leisure time and still have good health and also relaxing results. Without having to rely on cigarettes, they can play music, sing, dance, and play Extra, which have the benefit of using free time then. Also, the practice of musical expression can also train the heart. The challenge of arts and crafts activities such as drawing, sculpting, or using hundreds of beads is like meditation and you create value by yourself. In addition, young people know problems rationally with no tobacco dependence. They know their roles and responsibilities with the intention of fighting fees. They obey the teachings of parents and business teachers and behavior, but do good. The cheerful spirit of challenge with the principles of religion is a way of Florida life. Apart from self-help, we can also help friends and others in society with a joint campaign to reduce smoking and help quitting."

It increases their chance of lung diseases and heart failure. Watching the video in class this evening opened my eyes a little bit more because tobacco contains about 4,000 chemicals, including 200 known poisons. Every time someone smokes, poisons such as benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide are released into the air. Those are among the most important. In fact, some of my friends like to smoke, though most don't. Non-smokers will probably tend to hang around more with non-smokers than with smokers, while smokers usually don't care. Smokers need lots of money because smoking is expensive and keeps getting more expensive. Not only does smoking create bad results for smokers but also the bad results affect nearby persons and they get vexed. The last reason is that there are many consequences to smoking like bad health, addiction, cessation, and economic costs. Second hand smoke is a major problem, since smoking is allowed in a lot of public places. Second hand smoke has fifty cancer causing chemicals. Thus, I agree with banning smoking in all areas."

When you walk on the street, you can find a person who is smoking along the way. You would see at least one person because smoking is not prohibited. I will give you an example of a place that has smoking: restaurants, places that have every generation of human come in it. Actually, people who come to these places come in with family on holidays. What do you think when your family comes to a restaurant and finds that this restaurant allows smoking. Is this still a holiday? Smoking is killing your mood when eating and talking with your family. However, this is not as important as that it kills your family when they breathe smoke. In my opinion, the government must approve the laws that prohibit smoking in public.

Smoke is smelly, and when smokers smoke at restaurants, it disturbs other people. Furthermore, it becomes air-pollution. Smokers should not smoke at restaurants or public places. No one likes smoke so that smoker must have manners with other people. Some restaurants or public places have a smoking place, so smokers must smoke at this place. People can ban smokers who don't have manners because smoke can give the lungs cancer and smokers should take care of other people. Moreover, smoking can make danger at restaurants because restaurants have many gases, and when a smoker is smoking a spark of fire can make danger. Banning it can decrease smokers because smokers cannot smoke in public places. It makes them feel it is hard to smoke. If people do not ban bad smokers in the future, smoking may increase and it can become a simple behavior for smokers.

Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer or heart disease and that it can shorten your life. Smoking is a hard habit to break because of the drugs in cigarettes. The problems are that it might turn teeth, nails, and toenails yellow and give people bad breath. People around smokers will be uncomfortable because of the smell and the smoke of the cigarettes. Personally, I think the government or any who are concerned should try to stop people from smoking, especially in public areas such as restaurants, parks, and malls. Many young people begin smoking as an act of rebellion and independence. Young smokers start smoking at the age of 12 or 13 just to get a taste of what it is like. Some of them find it disgusting and unhealthy and some of them find it cool. You can see smoking is bad for your health. Your health requires pure oxygen in life, so you must stop smoking and do something before it's too late."

That is the worst thing for traditional teenagers. Smoking is a cause of cancer and harms the smoker and people around them. There are many disadvantages about smoking cigarettes. For example bad smell, black teeth and gums, and addiction. In my opinion smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, and not only restaurants but also schools, hospitals, parks, or public places. Although, in my opinion, this is the best way to make a good environment and save smokers' health and others around them while having a meal in a restaurant, it is also bad for the smokers, so we should have some area or place for smoking like the smoking areas in the airport. Because not all people are smokers, I think the owner of the restaurants should declare an area for smoking or make specific types of restaurants for their customers. I think smoking is bad for you and your family. No smoking is the best thing to do. For the smokers, when you want to smoke, maybe think about the others around yourself and mind your manners so no one will argue with you."

Most teenagers do not like smoking in restaurants with children and the aged, so a check is made very inappropriate because it is highly toxic to other people. Teenagers like to smoke a lot, in canteens too. Especially male students like to smoke everywhere, in canteens, in front of schools, food shops or in restaurants. They think they are cool and very handsome and girls will fall for them but this is not the case. A girl who likes a boy who smokes will be sorry in the future because she is putting her life in danger and risking getting cancer with that boy. She doesn't smoke but she smells it every time so someday she may get hurt from smoking before him because there is no protection from smoke. If the restaurants agree to not allow people to smoke, they can save many people's lives because people are saved from danger. We should ban smoking everywhere, not only in restaurants. The police should catch them, too."

For example, nicotine can make you get mouth cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, and cancer anywhere that it can be absorbed, so cigarettes are not a good accessory for your life. Moreover, we have a rising number of smokers aged 15-20. It will have an effect on the country, but now we have a big problem, which is how to not allow smoking in restaurants, because smoking in these areas will make a lot of problems; it makes consumers unhappy and makes them unhealthy, too. At the same time, the merchant will have fewer benefits, too. So, this is the big problem that we need to cooperate with each other to solve. If we help each other to solve this problem it will be good for everyone, but how we can solve this problem? First, smokers should know that smoking in restaurants is not good for everyone because smokers will gain the toxins fifty percent of the time, but non-smokers will gain one hundred percent of the toxins from inhaling suddenly and the smell of cigarettes will make the taste of food go down, and because the air in the room is not good, it will make people unhappy so the smoker must concern themselves with what they should do or not before smoking. It will help everyone be happy."

I wouldn't like there to be any smoking in the building but do not have any objections to people smoking outside. I do think that people should be made more aware of the damaging effects of smoking. I find it unpleasant when people are smoking just outside the exits of buildings as you are forced to breathe in the smoke. Many people can't breathe because it stings and is hard to take a deep breath into the body. Thus, in my point of view, it is a good idea to say that smoking should not be allowed in the restaurants, universities, workplace, and many places where many people are. Smoking should happen outside only at lunchtime, not at regular breaks, and smoking should be banned at all workplaces and public places. I hope to see this happen at my university too. I don't want to see students smoking, either."

In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Not only is smoking any form of tobacco dangerous to your health, but it is also bad for the health of those around you. Smoking should be banned at restaurants and all public areas. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it causes in children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes, and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. Smoking in public is the same as driving drunk because both endanger the lives of innocent people who choose not to engage in the reckless behavior. The only difference is that with smoking, the effects are not visible immediately because it has long-term effects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. Therefore, I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. However, everyone agrees that it is a matter of rights - the right of smokers to smoke versus non-smokers to be protected from passive smoking and to breathe clean air."

Smoking is one of the drugs that harms the human body. Most restaurant customers will not sit smoking in their restaurants. It makes people dissatisfied and they may not return to receive service any more. A restaurant is a restaurant, and serves food and drink, but not to smoking customers. Some restaurants will have room for smoking customers to sit. Some restaurants will mark a smoking area. Most customers will take children, old men sit to eat, some families have a pregnant wife eating as well, and the idea of smoking itself is disturbing others. Because tobacco smoke has a nasty bite on the eyes and is smelly, people around you and everyone within the restaurant are hurt. The conclusion is that smoking is hazardous to health and people around, such that the body's state quickly declines, so I think we should care for each other well and exercise frequently together rather than mess with drugs. All people should be concerned with the dangers of smoking, and we should seriously ban this in order to save the next generations."

At restaurants, everybody wants to eat food and enjoy time with family, and if they must eat food among the smell of smoke they will be really upset. People should have manners at restaurants, and we must not smoke at restaurants or public places. I think it is like a crime. It can slowly kill not only the smoker but also it can kill everyone who is around the smoker, for example, maybe their wives, sisters, brothers, and everybody around them. When I go to a restaurant, I want to eat and enjoy eating and if I meet someone who is smoking, I think that I will be really upset and angry. Therefore, I think every country should ban smoking at restaurants and maybe people who smoke should smoke before going to the restaurant. I think restaurants must be clean and fresh because restaurants are places to enjoy eating and relaxing. Restaurants may provide places for smokers to smoke if they still want to serve smokers."

The people around you are society too, and smoking in a restaurant, a place people eat much, is bad. Both children and adults eat together, so someone smoking in a restaurant may make people who are eating not like it or be unsatisfied and they will see that smokers are not good. Another restaurant where people do not smoke will make the restaurant look like it is good quality and more people will go to eat more food together. Restaurants that make a pure atmosphere may be the favorite for the common person. Therefore, stores where the atmosphere is pure to clients and diets are right and do not smell or have odor caused by cigarette smoking should have ""no smoking"" on their menu or in the restaurant itself. For people dining to know that this store is a non-smoking place will cause people to prefer to eat food at your restaurant and menu and better tastes may be made the more you sell."

They separate smoking areas and non-smoking areas. For anyone who wants to smoke, they will respect the rules by going outside so people sitting in the restaurant don't get any smells from the cigarettes. Restaurants are for having fun and relaxing, it doesn't need to ban smokers. In coffee shops, many people love drinking coffee and smoking. I think it is personal taste, so if we still produce and sell cigarettes, why do we have to ban them? To ban smoking is not the solution. If people don't want to see anyone smoke, we should stop producing and selling cigarettes. Smoking should not be banned, but we should just have two different areas for customers, for smokers and for non-smokers. Thus, everyone is happy because each side has their own place. Smokers got their place to smoke, non-smokers got their place to enjoy eating, and the owner of the restaurant is happy because they don't lose any customers."

It may help people to relax or feel good, but I don't feel that. In my opinion, it's not a good idea to smoke if you have nothing to do. My friends think that it is cool and girls like it. I don't agree with that. If the restaurants allow people to smoke, it can't be a restaurant. It should be a nightclub or place to smoke. Food is not delicious and smells so bad. How can I eat there?

In the case of smoking in restaurants, I think it is a big problem. That is because restaurants are places for eating, partying, or having some special time to make good memories. Therefore, there really shouldn't be smoking in these places, but if some restaurants don't have to ban smoking, I think a good way to solve the problems is the manager of the restaurant should provide a special area to smoke. However, smokers should be aware also. They can go out of the restaurant to smoke so it will not be a problem to everybody in restaurant.

From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, smoking is the easiest way to destroy users and people around them. I have no idea why smokers want to harm themselves, but I think that no one wants to stand near smokers and inhale a lot of pollution into their lungs. There are many people dying every day because of disease from tobacco smoke. Another reason is that restaurants are public places that everyone can come into. There are people who hate the smoke from tobacco very much. It is extremely impolite to make them irritated and destroy a good atmosphere in a restaurant by your smoking.

Therefore, this place has people of different ages such as children, teenagers, adults, and old people. If someone is smoking in a restaurant, it could affect the people who surround them. Imagine that how many people surrounding them will be second-hand smokers. It also affects smokers themselves.

Smoking is carcinogenic and when people smoke cigarettes, smoke released into the environment allows people to inhale it with the air causing a health hazard. Therefore, banning smoking in diverse places is important and particularly it is appropriate to enforce the ban in restaurants as the atmosphere while eating is one important part as well. Restaurants in Thailand do not have a sticker on the door. Shops that have narrowed their angle for visitors or customers to smoke are clear and entering them is dangerous to lure people in that area.

From this, it shows that smoking is the biggest problem that influences health, the environment, and the personality of the person who smokes. Firstly, smoking is not good because it damages our health. In cigarettes, there are many toxic chemicals that can damage your lungs. Moreover, according to  research, smoking is more dangerous to the people who inhale it than to the people who smoke. Many people have to suffer from lung and heart disease, and for some people, we have to open their windpipe and attach a pipe to help that person breathe. Secondly, smoking makes people lose their good personality. People who smoke will have black lips and become thinner. Smoking will make people ill and unhealthy, and then they will look bad, lose their good qualities, and look worse as a result. Finally, smoking is not good because it creates a bad environment. The smoke from cigarettes has an awful smell and makes the area have a bad smell too. The smoke has toxic chemicals, which causes diseases in people. In addition, it is harmful for plants and other living things too. Many plants around the smoking area will become unhealthy and die.

Smoking is bad for your health and other people's health, like by causing bad breath, bad teeth, inhalation of pollutants, and bad looks.

Therefore, we should ban smoking in restaurants because it has many bad results for health, atmosphere, and eating. This is not something far from us.

This attracts customers into the store, where customers will feel comfortable and all ages can focus. The restaurant should not allow smoking to interfere with the dining customers. It can cause health damage to a customer. We should respect each other, especially the elderly, and sometimes there may be residual smoke in the food if you are smoking in the restaurant. Finally, banning smoking in restaurants is right and proper because restaurants are places for people who want to eat something good. They do not want bad things, so whoever enters restaurants should consider what their actions should be, and consider that smoking in restaurants would be wrong because it would destroy the health of people."

When you have a meal in a restaurant, if you smell a bad thing, you will not like it. I think that the smell of smoke is one of the smells that needs to be completely banned in restaurants because when someone is smoking, the smell will annoy everybody around them and it also causes lung cancer in everybody. There must be a forceful law about smoking in restaurants, such as a penalty if you smoke in a restaurant area or being sent to jail. There is another way to fix the problem of smoking in restaurant areas. If a restaurant allows smoking in its area, it must have a special room for smoking so the smell will not annoy everybody anymore. There are lots of ways to fix the smoking in restaurants problem but I think the best way to fix this problem is to teach good morals to babies and tell them smoking is a bad thing, or the government must create a new law banning smoking, not just in restaurants but everywhere. That will make the country better."

A lot of profits are earned by both governments and enterprises each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for the health of smokers and non-smokers are equal or even worse for non-smokers. Smoking can cause cancer and many other symptoms. Smoking in public places such as public parks, bus stops, or in the street, which are open areas, cause danger to the health of people, not only smokers but also non-smokers who are in the area. If smokers smoke in a closed area such as in a theater, house, restaurant, airplane, etc., it can cause more danger because everyone, both smokers and non-smokers, will easily be harmed by the smoke. Restaurants are places where people come to enjoy their food and drinks, mostly with their families, and if smokers come to sit together in the same restaurants and start to smoke, it can ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to the health of all people around them. The air-conditioned restaurants are even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes because there is no air ventilation to get rid of all the smoke and it will be in the breath and lungs of all people. The government, especially the ministry of public health, which takes care of the health of people, should issue a law against smoking in both non air-conditioned and air-conditioned restaurants to keep people away from cigarette smoke. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."

Don't you think it is very annoying when you are eating happily with your family or your friends, and then there is some smoke and bad smells that come suddenly to your table? I don't understand why people smoke. Smoking only affects people in a lot of bad ways, especially in terms of their health. Smoking is a cause of many diseases of the lungs, throat, mouth, and heart. Even if you smoke only one time, you will have more risk of getting lung cancer and heart disease. Not only smokers have this risk, but people around the smoker have the risk too. It is sad that the people who receive smoke from the smoker, called 'second-hand smokers,' have a higher risk than the smokers themselves! I think every smoker knows the bad things about smoking and knows that he or she will hurt their loved ones. Then why do some still smoke? I think we should ban all smoking in public places, not only in restaurants, and we must do it legally. If smoking is bad for everybody, why do we still keep it in our country? Why we don't stop them and have better health?"

The smoking problem is getting worse and worse every year. Kids that are around thirteen years old start to smoke because members of their family smoke. The law is very weak. Nobody cares or obeys the law. I think Thailand should be more serious about this problem since the percentage of people dying from cancer has also increased. The law is just written on paper and announced to look good but in practice, no one follows the law. This is what happens in Thailand. We ask for many things, we wish to be on top in this area, but that can't be because we don't respect the rules. When we get arrested we just use money or refer to a famous family, so nothing happens. Why don't Thai people follow the law so we can become developed? People just do as they desire and not what society wants. When people separate and don't care about the law, it is harder to stop them and to develop the country. Please do something serious and start it ourselves. We can teach ourselves to be followers of the law and be models for others so all these problems can be solved. It is hard to ban smoking if people still don't care, even if I agree with the topic statement."

Are you one of the people that smokes at restaurants? Nowadays, there a lot of people complaining that they want to ban smoking at restaurants, what do you think about it? In my opinion, there are two major reasons for banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. They are that it disturbs others and increases the risk of accidents. First, smoking at restaurants disturbs others such as children, women, and pregnant women. Other people at the restaurant will be disturbed by the smell and smoke from smoking. Smoke from cigarettes contains substances that are harmful to the human body, so smoking at restaurants is disturbing to others and also harmful to their bodies. Second, smoking at restaurants increases the risk of accidents. Smoking cannot occur without fire, and the chefs at restaurants cannot cook food without gas, so if the smokers lack caution, there is a chance for there to be an accident. In conclusion, smoking at restaurants should be banned for two major reasons. It disturbs others and is harmful to the human body. If Thai people cannot stop smoking at restaurants, what kind of society will Thailand become in the future?"

In my opinion, there are several benefits from the part-time job experience. First, without a doubt, college students spend a large amount of money on food, groceries, pleasure, and so on. Therefore, having a part-time job can not only release the economic pressure on the family but can also make students take responsibility for it. Second, many fourth-grade students, who are about to graduate, worry about their future jobs; therefore, having part-time jobs before graduation helps students collect social experiences and have the chance to come close to everyday work life. In this way, college students are more likely to find out their true interest in various fields of work, which may explain the reason why many students after graduation are not in the relevant fields they learned on campus. Additionally, part-time jobs offer another learning opportunity for students. Don't look down on any job; every job is filled with knowledge and values. Take servers for example, if students have jobs in restaurants, they should learn how to deal with many unexpected problems, including keeping a smile and patience while being blamed by the boss or customers. As time goes by, students will become more mature and good at solving problems wisely. Are you a college student? Do you have a part-time job? If not, why not find a part-time job right now!"

In my opinion, first, most students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do everything by themselves before they become freshmen. When they become a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown to go to a good university and parents might tell them that they should deal with everything by themselves including living costs. So this is definitely a good chance to train them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for making friends by having part-time job experiences. It is useful for training them and making their world wider. Besides, friends who they meet in their part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, they might find their best friend, or even their soul mate, and friends or bosses that can give a hand in their future job when they meet some difficulties. When doing a part-time job, the life in university can be looked at as a little society, so before entering the real society, it can be a good chance for students to practice and find ways to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having a part-time job experiences might be useful and make it easier for students to find good jobs."

Taiwan's education is not similar to the U.S.; we don't have many choices from which to choose to experience in school. Only in college can we choose many ways to learn, even if your major is not in the department, you can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can study many things, and you can control what time you want to go to school, except for major classes. How many classes you have experienced? Except for major classes, you have much time to do what you want to do, you might want to rest instead of being in class all day or you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long do you stay in college? General students have 4 years in college in Taiwan; you spend one third of that time going to major classes and more than one third going to other classes, there is not much time left to do things you want to do in depth.

Besides, many employers want to hire people who have work experience before entering their companies. Thus, work experience for students is important. As we can see in the colleges, most of the students have a part-time job when they study. They not only want to earn their living, but also accumulate work experience. This experience is important for writing their resumes. When they want to enter a company in the future, many employers look at the section on work experience in the resumes. The more experience you have, the easier it is to enter your favorite company. And that's the reason why college students want to have a part-time job while studying. Take me for example, now I'm a college student, and I'm seeking a part-time job for the summer vacation. In order to broaden my work experience, I have tried many kinds of tasks which are totally different, such as a receptionist at the World Trade Center and a telephone caller in a cram school. In my opinion, once I have done more jobs, I will have more chance to enter my favorite firm. To extend the work experience, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job.

Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no longer kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure on their parents. They have to understand how hard it is to work, so that they can save and never waste their money. Second, they will no longer be students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job will suit them through having part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, I have to do the military responsibility first for one year, and then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about not being able to find a job, and I may face the same situation in one year's time. One of my classmates declined the chance to be a teacher in kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after job interviews, because they found they didn't have the skills or experiences that the bosses wanted. So I think it's good to test college students' abilities by having a part-time job."

There are some reasons to explain why we should have a part-time job. First, because lots of goods are more expensive than before and families give children less pocket money, college students have to look for part-time jobs to buy many things. In addition, I think that we know many people who have their own characteristics in society, including our friends. Finally, to enhance the social experience, practice my working attitude, and gain more jobs in the future, I can't avoid doing work. And this is the main reason that college students have to have part-time jobs. In sum, having a part-time job helps me to understand that I can't give up halfway through a hard task nowadays.

They can earn a living by getting part-time jobs, so that they will know that earning money is not as easy as they thought. Once they have a part-time job, they will be more careful when spending money and be more responsible for their behaviors. Second, by doing a part-time job, they can make friends with people who have the same interests. For example, if you work as a sales assistant, you will meet someone who is outgoing and also loves to interact with other people; if you work in the kitchen of a restaurant, you will meet someone who is also interested in cooking or baking. So no matter what kind of job you get, you can always find someone who shares the same interests with you. Last but not least; through the job, students can learn something which they cannot learn in school, such as, how to interact with customers and what to do when they complain, and how to work perfectly with co-workers and the boss. They will also know which ability they are lacking, so they can learn even harder during their free time at school. For those three reasons, I totally agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

I have to teach junior high school students geography. The work is more difficult than my first part-time job. I have to help them improve their geography test grades. If the students don't learn the subject, I will receive complaints from the students' parents and the other cram school teachers. I not only have to ensure high geography test grades, but I also have to edit the new geography textbook. It's not easy for me. My third part-time job was a sales clerk at KFC. The work was busy.

Everyone wants to do the job they want, so you can't avoid being compared with others, as many companies decide who they want based on who has the most pro-level knowledge. Some companies will decide based on your part-time work experience, but most part-time jobs aren't related to the job you want because the company doesn't let untrained people do complex jobs. Therefore, you might not benefit from your part-time experience when you look for a job. Part-time jobs are not a bad choice when you are a student, but you should control your time well. Don't let your part-time job take up a huge part of your life. You still have to take the time to concentrate on your studies. Studying should still be your priority.

But work may not surpass own elevating capacity, in order to avoid the schoolwork they could not bear, instead the gain does not equal the loss, like this lost the significance which worked. Although more than half of present university students go to work, not many can give their studies proper attention. While work may enable students to experience society earlier and lighten some of the burden on the parents, if people take work too seriously and they are unable to give enough attention to their studies, they may not be able to graduate, which will increase the expenses of their studies.

It is good to have some work experience while in school, as more work experience might help you have more chance than others to get the job you want after you leave school. This means, it may bring you more competitive advantage than others. You can also learn how to get along with people and understand the difficulty of earning money, and it may make you more mature. However, as we may spend almost all our lives seeking work and working hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it during our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood and want to be students when they start working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think spending time at a part-time job is worthwhile. Moreover, for those who cannot manage their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on a part-time job, which may cause students' school grades to drop. Thus, if there is no need to get a part-time job, I think students should enjoy their college life. Don't be too eager to step into your business life or you may regret it."

However, this phenomenon has been widely questioned by most people today, who think that the reason a student goes to a university is to study and gain knowledge instead of working and earning money. Hence, is a part-time job really good for a student or does it have a bad impact on the student? The answer is that it has pros and cons; it is only based on personal opinion. For me, having a part-time job consists of more pros than cons. For example, students who go for a part-time job can not only earn extra income but also learn how to balance their work and studies. They begin to learn how to manage their money well and, of course, when they are exposed to working life, they will definitely learn extra knowledge that is not taught in school. For example, the way they communicate with their colleagues is totally different from the way they communicate with their friends. In addition, they also learn how to be more independent and responsible. No matter how, most students go for a part-time job mainly because of financial problems such as they may have difficulty paying their tuition fees and so on. Thus, one of the fastest ways to solve their problem will be to get a part-time job. However, most of them normally face the problem of not getting enough sleep and being absent from their classes due to his or her part-time job. As a result, their performance in school may be influenced. In conclusion, getting a part-time job can be a controversial topic as it may be beneficial for someone who is willing to learn but disadvantageous for someone who is weak at managing themselves."

In a job, you can meet many different people, such as your colleagues, customers, and boss, you will go through many things with them, and you can learn a lot of knowledge and interesting things. Sometimes you can meet bad people, who can cause you trouble, but you have to stay calm, not get angry, and try to communicate with them. In this process, you can strengthen your mind. In addition, you can get money from a part-time job, which can lower home expenses, so, I support college students doing a part-time job. As an example, I have a part-time job in Carrefour in the summer vacation and winter vacation. One of my colleagues comes from the south of Taiwan, he is very interesting and funny and helps me understand everything. In the work, we can meet very many customers, someone can't find something, but the thing is in front of them, some can ask stupid questions, which are not related to my work, but after the question I can get a ""thanks"", which makes me feel content."

When I leave school, I have to run to my office. I have tried telephoning at cram schools or standing on the street all afternoon to distribute DM. I have little time to join my friends' activities. I left the ball team because I could not handle it. Sometimes I hate that I have to work, but I also find new fun in my part-time job. I can practice my conversation skills while being a waitress, and I can be friends with many other students like me, and I learn many experiences that I can't learn in school. I have also found a way to balance both my school and my job. I can use my time well to do each thing. I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because not everyone can handle both in his college life, but if you have the ability, you can train yourself and gain achievement in different areas.

In our country, children are protected by their parents until they are 18 or older. We don't have much time to experience the outside world. Going to college is the first time we have to deal everything ourselves, so I think it's a perfect time to make more friends and know how hard it is for our parents earn money. You can learn a lot of things from a part-time job; for example, if you are a clerk, you can learn how to use the cash register and how to talk to customers. From those experiences, you may know how to interact with other people in a polite way. Also, you can try to release some pressure off your parents by letting them know you can do those things, so they don't have to worry about you. Moreover, in college we have a lot of activities, so you always have to spend some money. If you want to save money, you must try to earn money, and the income must be more than the money you spend. Although it's important to have a part-time job, we must remember our main job is our school work. Learning how to schedule our time is another challenge. Having a part-time job can make students more independent and more responsible for their lives."

The major purpose of college is education, thus, the college must provide a safe environment and a peaceful learning place. Because of the safe environment at school, students are always protected from the ruthless social reality of work, so they cannot observe the differences between the workplace and the educational place. Students can gain skills which are important in the workplace, such as work attitude, and they can increase their patience in order to deal with problems. Additionally, they will understand how to find out the relation between the part-time job and the knowledge they learned in college. Most of all, a part-time job for college students can make them actively get friends and expand their viewpoints, so they will not set their target too small and narrow in the future. Of all the effects of a part-time job, I think the most important and deepest one is about work attitude and patience. Even if someone is smart or learned, he or she will easily be in trouble if he or she lacks one of the above. Frankly speaking, learning how to get along with people will always be important and more difficult than the learning of knowledge. We can compare the workplace with a new college that proffers the learning of human relations. From a part-time job, we can learn more skills about how to live well in the workplace."

Before I was a university student, some bosses may have thought I was too young to do some part-time jobs, so it was difficult to find a part-time job. The special experience in my part-time job was to teach children aged only five years' old. At first, I thought it was a difficult job, but when I realized how to face children, I was so happy that I could do this job, it gives me so many experiences and I love children more than before. A part-time job is a good way to kill time and make some new friends. Therefore, I suggest that all college students find a suitable job in their free time; however, they cannot forget their school studies. They must be careful not to be cheated because they want to make money, so they should find the healthiest way to find a happy part-time job to enrich their lives."

Except for making money, I got something else from working part time. First, I learned how to deal with different problems, because I had to face different customers who had different requests. Second, the more work experience you have, the easier it is to get a job in the future. In my process of finding jobs, most bosses don't like to hire employees who have no experience. From my viewpoint, accumulating as much work experience as possible is good for you in the future. Different jobs can teach you something that is not taught at school. Even though there are so many advantages for having a part-time job, students shouldn't let the part-time job affect their school life. We should make the perfect balance between part-time jobs and school life. Giving consideration to these two things makes your college life colorful.

It is a way to learn other things and we can know how to live in the world. We can also know how hard our parents worked for us. If you have a part-time job, you can learn how to perform duties and learn many things. We can lighten our parents' burden. Parents should feel happy we can do it for them. I think there are two types of part-time jobs. One is fixed work. The other is unfixed work. The unfixed work involves going everywhere to work. If you think have to work every day, you should find fixed part-time work, because if you are only a student, it might be difficult to find all the jobs because you have to study in school.

There are many reasons why I think working part-time is a good idea. The first advantage that comes to mind is that students can earn their own money for their allowance. They are no longer a burden on their families. Some outstanding students can even become financially independent. Second, people who earn money by themselves tend not to spend money because they want to but because they need to. Since they earn every penny by themselves, they understand the value of money and learn to cherish it. Besides, in order to maintain a normal school performance, it is meaningful for college students to learn how to manage their time well. Time management is vital at all times. What's more, they may have trouble with their co-workers, employers, or customers. When dealing with problems, they understand the value of cooperation and identify their responsibilities. However, some people may still disagree with college students having part-time jobs because they think that students should focus on their academic work and having part-time jobs will not have a positive influence on students' school performances. Nevertheless, as I explained before, that is not always true. Although school performance is important, it isn't everything. Part-time jobs can teach students something that they can't learn in school. I think students who have part-time jobs acquire more benefits than those who don't."

College students have many social activities, like clubs, parties, and some competitions. They want to make more friends and experience a different life, so they spend more. Because they spend more, they need some extra money in their pocket. So, some college students find part-time jobs such as a tutor. If the working hours are too long, sometimes those college students will delay their studies, but they are usually shortsighted. They think that earning money is much more important than studying well. They waste their time on part-time jobs and join too many activities. As a result, some people suspend their schooling to get more part-time jobs. When they grow older, they will regret their decision; it is like putting the cart before the horse. They give up their studies for a meager salary. That's really ridiculous. As far as I am concerned, maybe I would get a part-time job if I had much free time, like the summer or winter vacations, or if I can pass the course easily. The most important thing is to complete the course you are there to study. Then, after you graduate, you will find a better job."

While we are in school, people always say that school is just like a small society. But if we want to learn how to socialize with people or compromise with others, we should get a part-time job. It's the fastest way to know how society works. Although we may feel upset in some way, every challenge is a new opportunity to experience society, and it makes us stronger. In the future, when we graduate from college and get a full-time job in other places, we will discover that the frustrations we faced before are nothing at all because we know how to deal with them, and solve problems from experience. While searching for a part-time job, there is some important information for students to know. Students should focus on their schoolwork and concentrate on their major courses, without interruption from the job. A part-time job is just a lesson to prepare us to enter society, but we students can't mix them, or we may screw them both up.

I felt very satisfied, but the more people have, the more unsatisfied the heart becomes. So I felt unhappy when I had spent all my money. My best friend, Cindy, works at a part-time job every day. Her life is work, work, and work. When we have a group report, she usually can't do it with us, but it is important to attend our class, so we became unhappy and told her that it's not right. If the thing she learned in college is just work, and she ignores her friends, studies, grades, and future, it's like putting the cart before the horse. Now we don't do reports with her anymore. It is no use crying over spilt milk even if she regrets it. Maybe a part-time job can make one more and more wise, but it can let one lose one's college life.

It is a hot time that many people want to find part-time jobs, especially students, because we now have more free time to work. If we make good use of the summer vacation, we can have extra money to use from a part-time job. Part-time jobs have some advantages for us. First, we don't have to throw all of our time into it. For most jobs, you just need to choose some period that you can go to work. Second, you can learn more new things and skills, most importantly, and also the ordinary reason we want to get a part-time job, is that we can earn some money. However, finding a part-time job also has some bad parts. One is that the salary is very little. Sometimes the employer may take students as free workers. The pay isn't equal to the amount we work. The other is that there are plenty of illegal jobs nowadays. If we don't pay full attention and find jobs carefully, we may break the law.

For example, standing for eight hours in hot weather to hand out flyers to passersby is very tiring. So they will not only save the money in the bank but barely draw any money from the bank because money is hard to earn. Secondly, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. At the beginning, they couldn't do well at all and often made mistakes. Gradually, they could do a very good job, and then they feel very excited when they receive a pay check for the first time.

After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work also teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in the younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus they will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them understand better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things.

But they can't spend time resting, studying, or doing something good! Third, part-time jobs can earn more cash.

I think a part-time job has positive and negative effects. The advantage is that you can learn more about how to socialize with other people; this can help you to find jobs when you graduate. The disadvantage is that you may need more time to study, or your grades will be so bad that you could flunk out of school. A part-time job can have both positive and negative effects on a person. First of all, students will be able to earn more money in order to pay their tuition, their rent, or buy whatever their heart desires. Moreover, one can learn how to socialize with others, which is beneficial when looking for a job upon graduation. However, the time needed for one to study diminishes. This can cause one's grades to drop drastically, which may, in turn, cause one to fail. In conclusion, students should only get a part-time job if they are able to handle their studies as well. Students who have a part-time job enter the society earlier than those who haven't. While working part-time, students experience how the society functions and learn how to deal with issues maturely. Having a part-time job could give the students hands-on experience to test their skills and see whether they are interested in the field of work. Additionally, students working at an early age encounter the hardship of earning a living themselves; therefore, they treasure and view money differently. Students with a job could also help out their family's finances."

Different students have different needs. Rich students do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not, but for poor students, having a part-time job is very important. However, some students will have a part-time job in order to get work experience. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send much money for me as an allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to restaurants or go traveling, etc., I have to pay for myself. Students have part-time jobs not only to earn some money as an allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily life, and the other, a school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and I can earn 95 NT dollars per hour. Although, having a part-time job is quite important for some students. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided by my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different for different students. As long as you need one, then just go find one. But we should also remember to not only take on the responsibility of the job but also protect ourselves."

There are many advantages for university students to get a part-time job. First, if they get a part-time job which is related to their major, they will understand more about their major and future job. Many high school students in Taiwan just choose their major based on their grades or according to their parents. Some people find that they dislike their job after they start working in the field. However, they already spent years completing their Bachelor's degree and it may be too late for them to study another major in the university. One of my friend's major is accounting. After she had an internship at Ernst and Young, she realized that she does not want to work for the Big Four for the rest of her life. Another advantage of having a part-time job is earning money and the local economy. There are many traditional opportunities for university students to be a private tutor. Students can earn money while children in Taiwan can have a better education. According to some surveys, teenagers are more likely to spend money than other people. As a result, if university students cannot have a part-time job, there will be a negative impact on the local economy. In conclusion, university students have the right to have part-time jobs. Since there are so many advantages for students in getting part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

Some of them even spend most of their leisure time doing part-time jobs. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students because they can learn what they can't get from school. For example, they broaden their fields of vision by having more chances to get along with different people. Second, they learn to have sense of responsibility by taking charge of their tasks. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which makes their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job if they cannot concentrate on their studies. Although I think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning from their studies is the most important thing for college students. If students spend most of their time doing a part-time job, they will miss the chance to enjoy campus life and make precious memories. To make matters worse, they may fail their examinations. To sum up, college students should first do their best in their studies, and they should participate in activities in school, like clubs. Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and are thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Only if they still have time should they have a part-time job while enjoying their college life."

My answer might have been the opposite before I got two part-time jobs this summer. After working from 9 am to 7 pm in the place where I work now, I find several reasons why it is important for college students to work part-time. First, by working part-time we gain different kinds of work experiences before we graduate and work full-time. Full-time jobs mostly require professional knowledge and skills and they are more serious; thus, it is more difficult to change your job once you are in a full-time position. What part-timers are required to do is often less professional. When you are applying for a part-time job, there should be more choices so you gain different kinds of experiences from doing different kinds of jobs. This is precious because it might be a help to your future career; for example, you might learn some professional knowledge through the work, and through various kinds of work experiences, you might determine what you really want to do. Secondly, by earning money on our own, we are more likely to spend money in a more careful way. It is common for young people to spend money on unnecessary things, and part-time jobs are not usually high-paid jobs. Thus, by being paid based on our work hours, we realize how difficult it is to earn a living and thus build correct concepts of money. Still, there are some more benefits from working part-time, as it is a help to those students that face economic pressures. To sum up, I think as long as students are able to use their time well - that is, part-time jobs will not influence their studying - it would be beneficial to students to have a part-time job."

As long as one can organize his/her schedule well and use the time efficiently, a part-time job is a helpful experience and good training for the future career. Several key benefits of a part-time job will be discussed in the following. First, from a part-time job, a college student can get real experiences related to his/her major, which helps one understand more and apply what he/she has learned. Alternatively, he/she can explore a variety of jobs and discover the most suitable future path for him/her. And then he/she can turn the focus to what he/she wants to study. Moreover, working outside of the school may lead to the chance of meeting various people, which can further broaden one's horizon and enrich one's knowledge. Besides, it is a good chance to practice how to deal with people and business, e.g., cultivating patience and toughness, or forming the habits of efficiency and punctuality, and this does well for one's survival in society and in a future career. Last but not least, a part-time job helps to reduce the financial burden or is a resource for earning more allowance. Compared to stealing or cheating for money, a legal part-time job is a safe way to gain money. All in all, a part-time job is helpful for a college student, and thus having experienced part-time jobs is important in college life."

The following are some reasons why I consider having a part-time job is beneficial. To begin with, going to a college is like preparing to establish your future career. Students learn and study knowledge for what might be useful one day. If you can have a part-time job while you are studying, you can learn more efficiently from not only the textbook but also the real life experiences. In addition, having a part-time job can help you to gain respect from peers and establish relationships with others. Take myself as an example; I was once working in the National Theater as a receptionist. I learned how important it is to communicate and listen to customers. I became more eloquent when talking to others for I needed to give specific orders to my peers to help them accomplish some tasks. In fact, participating in both school and work was pretty exhausting. The tight schedule nearly made me fall to pieces. However, following that tough period, I can embrace challenges instead of giving up whenever I am faced with difficulties. I became more patient with people, and I welcome any criticism. In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students learn more efficiently, gain lots of experience, handle pressure well with patience, and welcome criticism. As a result, it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

It can not only make students gain work experience but it can also make them more independent. But for me, having a part-time job isn't very important. Nowadays, more and more college students have part-time jobs. When the class ends, students usually say that they are going to work. They work so hard that they don't have time to relax. Because of the work, when friends ask them to go shopping, they always turn them down. If you are always absent, friends will not invite you next time and you will become lonely. Besides, many students who have jobs after class often finish late. When they get home, they don't have the energy to review their homework, which makes them get lower grades in the class. Furthermore, because they are out of energy, some of them even sleep during the class. It's not worth it if you get lonely and get bad grades just because of the work. Before you get a job, you should take care of your schoolwork. Students should behave as students. Thus, I don't think it is very important for college students to get part-time jobs."

Since I started studying at university, I have taken many kinds of jobs from a waitress to a tutor. There are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I can't remember all of them. There are several reasons why I took so many part-time jobs and what part-time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own living. Since my family doesn't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for my life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with the students I tutor and I have learned some teaching skills. I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs, and it's really interesting to have some chats during work time. Part-time jobs take up a great part of my college life. Even though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I believe that I have learned a lot and matured from these experiences.

Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it also affects others' health; however, if we advocate no smoking in all restaurants in the country, what would the chain-smokers do? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, so it's hard to ask them to quit smoking in a short time. So, if all the restaurants ban smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen in the end? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking area or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking. The action doesn't encourage people to smoke; it just offers some room for smokers to relax temporarily. A chain-smoker will be unhappy if they cannot smoke, and who wants to see somebody with a long face when enjoying a meal at a restaurant? In conclusion, setting up smoking areas is better than banning smoking at all the restaurants, as it is a better policy that can bring reciprocal benefits for all the restaurants, customers, and smokers."

Moreover, smoking pollutes the environment and disturbs the environmental balance. Smoking in personal spaces might not influence other people, but it is unforgiveable to smoke in public spaces, as it is important to respect other people. Restaurants are places where people go to enjoy food and relax, younger and older people go too, so I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for everyone's health. Furthermore, I think smoking should disappear from the world to make people healthier, because health is a person's best treasure and has a big influence on all people, from young to old.

If a person is smoking next to you while you are enjoying delicious food, you will smell the smoke and feel uncomfortable. Even if the dish tastes good, you will just want to get away from the smoker and won't be able to enjoy your dish. Smoking in restaurants makes everyone unhappy and harms their lungs and yours. The smell easily gets on clothes, so people who are not smokers will be influenced by the bad smell, making others think they are smokers and thus giving a bad image. Not only does smoking harm your health but it also makes other people lose their human rights. If you do not care about your health, no one can stop you smoking, but other people have the right to say ""no"" to your behavior.

For smokers, it's a good chance to quit this unhealthy activity, as it causes lung disease. Much research proves that. But it's not effective for the smoker because they rely on smoking to reduce the pressure. The policy of banning smoking might reduce the amount of consumers at the restaurant because a lot of men want to smoke, even when they are eating dinner. It's an unchangeable but true situation. I think the government should set more rules like this not only in restaurants. They should try to make a non-smoking society. It's difficult but it could also put the country into a good situation because the power of the government is from the people. If people aren't healthy, it's not good for the country's development."

On the other hand, buying cigarettes is very expensive, as it includes a health tax. If you quit smoking, you can save a lot of money. On television, the ads to ban smoking are popular. Most celebrities on TV tell everybody the dangers of smoking. As for me, I hate people who are addicted to smoking, and I also hate the smell of smoke. Because my sister is a nurse, I learned a lot from her. She has taught me about the dangers of smoking. Smoking is very risky and harmful. I don't think anyone should smoke in public, especially in restaurants. That behavior should be banned strictly. People should respect others. In public, we should speak quietly and not smoke. I think the government should make a strict rule for restaurants to follow. If people smoke at a restaurant, they should get a fine. For everyone's health, banning smoking in public is very important. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

And if somebody is smoking, all the people in the restaurant will smell it. In my experience, I hate the smell of smoke, every time I smell the smoky air in a restaurant, I have a bad feeling, and I don't want to eat anymore because the food is also not clean. So I think it's better to have a law not to smoke in restaurants. Some restaurants are divided into two parts, smoking and non-smoking areas. But I think it's not a good idea, because we can still smell the bad air. So, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

There is much medical evidence showing that the harmfulness of second-hand smoke is greater than that of first-hand smoke. When someone smokes around you, maybe you will walk to them and say ""Excuse me, sir. This is a non-smoking place."" Usually this guy would throw away his cigarette and say sorry to you, but sometimes you are not so lucky. This man could say ""Why? Why don't you go away?"" At this time, the government should make a law to restrict the rights of the smoker and protect those non-smokers. The law should say that one cannot smoke at the place which has more than three people, including restaurants. If someone ignores the law, they should be fined ten thousand NTD. Based on the reason of health, smoking should be banned in public places such as restaurants. If we don't do this, we will suffer from health problems caused by smoke.

Therefore, in public places, these smokers are being unfair. If the smoker wants to smoke, they should select a place with good air circulation, so it will not hinder others. They will also enjoy smoking well and will not need to accept others' advice again. If restaurants establish a smoking area, this benefits the smoker and isolates the smoker from other people, so they cannot smell the tobacco from a distance; this is good for everybody.

And most importantly, people should have the right to refuse breathing in second-hand smoke. Restaurants are public spaces; therefore, people who want to smoke should consider others who might not be pleased to dine in an atmosphere full of smoke. After all, if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, how can you enjoy the smell of the food and taste it in good mood? People who have the habit of smoking should know that not everyone can stand the smell of it; in fact, the smell of smoke is terrible for some people who do not smoke at all. Moreover, it is obvious that smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke harms our health.

If this situation continues without any remediation, the consequences will be unpredictable. Many of us know that smoking is a bad practice, but even with all the information that states the effects of smoking, why do some people still need to smoke? One of the common reasons that leads a person to smoke is that he or she wants to release stress. Some people believe that they will actually feel better and more relaxed after they have a cigarette. However, there are a lot of other methods that can be used to release stress such as listening to music and having a conversation with friends. Therefore, why do people still choose a foolish way to release stress since there are so many other alternative ways? Every year, our government spends billions of money to stop people from smoking, such as organizing smoking campaigns to educate the youngsters to avoid smoking. Our government even restricts the selling of cigarettes to all youngsters under the age of 18. However, is this really effective? No, the fact is we can still find lots of underage smokers. It seems that the efforts from the government to prevent people from smoking still need significant improvements. However, the most important thing is that the smokers have to start changing their thoughts about smoking and their behavior or else the efforts our government has made will still be useless. I believe education plays a role, but it should start with small children. As a result, the chance for that child to become a smoker in the future will be lower. In addition, another important factor that may affect whether a child becomes a smoker is the behavior of the parents; parents who are smokers increase the chance of the children in that particular family to become smokers too. In conclusion, there are no specific ways to control and stop people from smoking but there are some ways to prevent people from smoking. Make the earth better and give yourself a better life; say ""No"" to cigarettes and be against smoking starting from today."

Sometimes in the restaurant, there are children and babies with their mothers, the smoke is not good for them and can affect their health. The restaurant is a closed room, so the smoke can fill the restaurant. So if you have to smoke, you should go out of the restaurant, to lower the effect. According to figures, the number of people who has died from second-hand smoke is more than smokers, so smokers are just like killers, but they do not know that they are killing people. Although some restaurants have set smoking places, you can still smell the smoke even when seated outside of the smoking place, which can still affect people's health.

It can hurt your breathing system and even result in lung cancer. Your teeth may be yellower and you can't give up this habit unless you make up your mind. You want one every time you finish your dinner, lunch, even breakfast. You especially like the feeling of smoking with your ""good friends"". You even like to go on smoking when your parents or wife (husband) do not want you to. Giving up smoking is a very long journey not only for you but also for your family.

Every time we choose a restaurant to have a date, we go on the Internet to search for information, call the restaurant to make a booking, and finally it's time to go to the restaurant. You are eating and chatting for a while and then a person sits next to your table and starts smoking. What should you do? People like to do whatever they want, but sometimes these things harm you and others. For the health of your friends and other people, if you want to smoke you should go outside of the restaurant. Smoking should be banned because some smokers only think about themselves. There should be laws to tell them not to do so. For good health, the best way is not to touch cigarettes."

If smoking were banned, it would cause a big problem. Second, the restaurant is an important social place where people chat with each other. If someone's habit is banned in the restaurant, he or she must be more passive when at the restaurant than before. Thus, it will damage business if managers directly ban smoking in their restaurants. Therefore, it is difficult for us to ban smoking in restaurants in the country. We can support smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke, but we cannot just ban it.

After all, this is a personal habit so a law cannot be implemented. So I think school education is important in letting people know that smoking is a bad habit. In addition to other personal health problems, smoking has very bad effects on the environment. When I see a smoker on the road, they do not take away their cigarette butts, but they readily throw them in the street. I think this is not very good.

This smoke also causes a bad smell and make people feel uncomfortable. The smoke produces ""second-hand smoke"", which is the smoke breathed in by people near a smoker. It makes non-smokers feel bad and can cause the same illnesses that smokers suffer from. So second-hand smoking harms other people, as well as the smoker. It's time for all governments in the world to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. If you want to enjoy your delicious dinner, you don't want to smell smoke. Non-smoking restaurants will be a tendency when more and more people pay attention to their health. Thus, there is no reason why this ""drug"" should be legal.

Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulting from smoking is the damage to health. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as non-smokers, so they can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life quality, too. Besides, smoking increases the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has a great impact on both the smokers themselves and the people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.

The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Banning smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers of their rights, but it protects other people's right.

Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also for others around them. Last but not least, smoking builds a negative appearance of a smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. As a result, we should try our best to prevent people from smoking."

Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea, even though it takes away some of our freedom. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer, and smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So many nonsmokers are against smoking. Therefore, a government ban on smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and the environment, so many people, especially nonsmokers, agree with policy. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom, but I think this is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in a public restaurant. In fact, smokers still have the freedom to smoke. But I think smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in public restaurants and everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. Smokers and nonsmokers thoughts are different, but they must communicate to achieve the goal of no smoking in public restaurants, to protect our health and the environment."

I would argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. However, even though people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smokers, they should be free to smoke elsewhere. Smoking not only spoils a particular person's health but it also affects his or her entire family. It's a curse. Today we are all sensible and we know what the disadvantages of smoking are, but we must stop this poison spreading in our society, country, and home. In short, people should not smoke in public spaces. If I went into a restaurant, and while I was waiting for my food to come, I smelled the smell of smoke, it would ruin my appetite. In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the nonsmokers present there but also may cause many people to cough. Besides, many youngsters who are fascinated by the act of smoking try to imitate it, which may later develop into a habit. All in all, smoking in public places is not good behavior. We should try to ban people from smoking in public places. To prohibit by law is obviously the best way."

I have two ways to instruct it. First, for personal health, I've heard a phrase ""Health is Wealth"", which means that people who have a healthy body and keep themselves well perhaps have a lot of money in their personal life! Smoking can encourage the body to become sick. When someone is smoking, it can harm his or her body a lot! Especially cancer. For example, when someone is smoking, that smoke will go through their mouth and throat and arrive at the heart. Day after day, the body can't restore its health; it's a big question in life! Second, for friends, neighborhood, classmates, or strangers around us, second-hand smoking is terrible, because it has a bad composition; it is worse than it is for a smoker. Most people don't like to make themselves do something they don't like. So for the reasons of personal health and second-hand smoking, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I know this ban may make smokers unhappy, because this ban stops smokers from smoking everywhere. I think they will still have a smoking habit in their life, but this ban is based on fairness for everybody, so when a smoker wants to smoke at a restaurant, they must think of other people's wishes."

I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is unfair. Although smoking is not illegal, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and will avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer a financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment, I discovered someone smoking, so I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But the staff said that the smokers had the right to smoke there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry. Luckily there are laws to restrain smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer be polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should have been set up even earlier."

Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that if someone smokes, some smell is produced from the cigarette, and the person's surroundings will smell bad. The bad smell certainly ruins the great meal and the mood. And the second reason is that smoking ruins people's health. Nowadays, more and more people die because of lung cancer. Some of them are addicted to smoking, but some of them are just breathing in too much second-hand smoke. Smoking not only makes people get cancer but also make the smokers' teeth become yellower day by day. That way, no matter how handsome he is or how pretty she is, when he or she smiles, their teeth will scare many people. The third reason is my personal opinion; I do not like to be with a guy who smokes in front of me. The bad smell really makes it difficult for me to breathe, and also makes all of my body, my hair, and my clothes smell bad! I think government should teach those who smoke to quit smoking, and the smokers should learn how bad their behavior is. So I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all of the restaurants."

First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is by totally banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer because many of his friends smoked. If this law had come earlier, many people would not have died of lung cancer. Third, restaurants are places for people to have meals instead of smoking. Those who smoke should not come to restaurants to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should go to a smoking area. In conclusion, since a lot of surveys have already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people will die from second-hand smoke."

I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants should have the right to decide what they do. They can welcome the customers who smoke, or they can put a ban on smoking. However, restaurants should have a sign on the door to let the customers know whether they can smoke there. If a person who doesn't smoke sees the sign that smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he would not go in and have a meal. Conversely, if a person doesn't care about the smell of smoke, even if smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he can still have a meal there. Besides, restaurants can be parted into smoking areas and nonsmoking areas. To sum up, the most important thing is that restaurants should mark clearly whether customers can smoke in the restaurant. Then customers can decide where they want to go. If a restaurant loses their customers by letting people smoke, they could afterward put a ban on smoking. Hence, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

To explain it in a simple way, people gain happiness through different ways. It just happens to be a harmful way for the smokers to gain happiness. It may urge them to quit smoking if the government practices the ban, but to those who haven't succeeded in quitting, it could be torture if they can't find a place where smoking is allowed except their homes, and it might cause further problems. There should be a substitute plan: Smoking should be banned at common restaurants, except for those with smoking areas set apart from non-smoking areas. Second, the number of restaurants with smoking areas should be limited. Third, any violation of the rules should be heavily-fined. The government should put more effort on educating people, preventing the non-smokers from starting to smoke, and providing help for the smokers to quit smoking before implementing such strict legislation. It is important for the government to think of a proper policy that makes both the smokers and non-smokers better off."

Instead, there should be a part of restaurants maintained for the smokers. The supporting reasons are as follows. First, smoking is a basic human right, even though it may be bad for the smoker's and others' health, we cannot forbid people to smoke. Therefore, restaurants that allow smoking should provide spaces for those who want to enjoy eating and smoking at the same time, and then these places can gather those who smoke together and leave those who cannot bear the smell of cigarettes in a comfortable place. Moreover, smoking is a special culture, and we should not wipe it out from the diverse society. Some restaurants provide water-smoke devices, and smokers gather together to share that habit, and tourists even come to visit that kind of restaurant. If the place of sharing a habit disappears, then the culture about the habit is hard to keep. Still, unlike drugs, of which only a little amount can lead to severe and immediate damage to the body and the loss of a working ability, cigarettes are not so dangerous; only a large amount of smoke cigarettes harm people's health. To sum up, smoking is more a right and a habit than a danger. Therefore, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, a second-hand smoke environment is worse than actually smoking cigarettes. A restaurant is a place for families, and people including kids and pregnant women, to have a nice meal. If you allow people to smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guests having a meal with you but also harmful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants, which would reduce the income of the restaurants and make them close down. The taste of food would be destroyed by smoking at the same moment as well. It is not a proper way to enjoy a nice lunch/dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as a lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only impolite but also has a bad influence on other customers' health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

In my opinion, smoking doesn't bring any benefits; it's a totally bad thing. Smokers shouldn't smoke in the restaurant. In restaurants, it's hard for them to have completely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. If one person smokes, then everyone around him has to breathe in the smoke. Also, the waitresses in a smoky bar or restaurant will breathe in entire boxes of cigarettes just from breathing the dirty air. For people who don't smoke, it's hard to stand it. Maybe people who smoke will think that it's nothing. But for people like me, who don't smoke, it is really stinky. Furthermore, when we breathe in the second-hand smoke they produce, we may have higher risk of getting cancer. Smoking is bad for our health. When people smoke, the smoke they produce also causes air pollution. Everyone wants to have a good environment when having meals. I think people shouldn't smoke when having meals. We should ban this in the country. Having meals is a pleasurable thing, but when people smoke during that time, I think most people won't feel good.

""Disgusting second-hand smoke again!"" I can't help but feel uncomfortable immediately owing to the smoke. ""How can people be fond of smoking and even have to smoke a lot every day?"" As far as I am concerned, smoking is no good for people. Not only does it harm your health and your lungs, but it also takes so much of your money to buy the cigarettes. You have to face the risk of getting lung cancer, spend a lot of money, and you are even hated by some other people. Then, why can't smokers stop smoking? I think some smokers can't quit because it makes them feel relaxed and they are even addicted in it. Therefore, it seems hard for those smokers to quit. And for some teenagers, they may think smoking is a cool thing and start to have the bad habit. However, I don't think people should keep smoking no matter what the reasons are. Smoking can not only harm your health but also harm the health of others. And it also makes the city more unclean because of the deserted cigarettes which are on the ground everywhere. Therefore, for everyone's health, the city's environment and saving money, I think smokers had better quit the bad habit as soon as they can."

The most important thing to us is studying. The chance to have a part-time job is always around you however the chance to study is not always around you. For instance, consider someone who has started studying late. They thought that their part-time job is more important than studying, but they realized that they must study at the appropriate time. Therefore, a part-time job is not more important than studying. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we do part-time jobs from the evening to late at night. Therefore, we cannot concentrate in our classes because of sleepiness. For example, I worked for a night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It was so hard on the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore, part-time jobs disturb students' concentration in class. Consequently, part-time work has become a social problem. Many news outlets report it as a social problem, so the Government has adopted a wise policy to encourage students to concentrate on their studies. The problem can only be resolved by the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time jobs are not our first priority."

Naturally, it is difficult to concentrate on your university major and it is tiring to sleep less because of your job.

Therefore, students experience social life and after they graduate from university, it is important to experience social life. Naturally, university life is a kind of social life, but it is different to having a part-time job. Last, by having a part-time job, you can realize the value of money. If one student does not have a part-time job and another student does have a part-time job, their attitude toward money will be different.

Take, for example, the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time studying to obtain a scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time jobs are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose, instead, to invest his or her time on studies while applying for a loan to support their tuition fees. Being able to pay their tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies, thus getting better results, and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems.

Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents' help. Therefore, they will know that earning money is very hard and they will think that money is precious. They won't easily spend money and their parents' money worries will be reduced. Finally, the reason I agree that college students should have a part-time job is making friends. While they work part-time jobs, they meet many people. They can make many friends and they meet many diverse people, and they will improve their speaking skills. Because speaking skills are very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful. For college students, having a part-time job has many benefits.

First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be sleepy in class. In the end, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on a fun time of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a person's time as a student is the freest time, except for the demands of studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help with everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying.

During their work, they will meet many people and will be faced with hard times, so meeting many people and building experiences are important. Second, they can get their own money. They can buy anything that they want to buy without their parent's help. Further, they can help their parents as they pay their tuition. If they earn money during vacation, they can get much money. Lastly, they can feel a sense of accomplishment as they do their work, so they will work well in the future. In conclusion, as they have a part-time job, they can get social experience and help their parents. They are also able to fulfill themselves through their part-time job. So, it is important for college students to get a part-time job."

These days, most students have a part-time job because they can't live on pocket money from their parents and they don't have enough money to go to university. Entry money is so expensive, too, so we cannot help but work a part-time job. I have a part-time job, too. If the entry pay will be low, we don't have to get a part-time job, but now the entry money is expensive. As such, poor students should have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will help to raise independence. While working, I can earn some money for myself. In addition, it will be good to have the experience of working at a store if one wants to open such a store themselves. However, there is demerit of having jobs that is accumulation of stress. Because we cannot earn much money in a short time. Finally, if you have a dream of what you want to do, you can choose the right part-time job so you can gain some experience before your dream comes true. So I agree to have a part-time job while in university. Accordingly, I made my position to agree with this idea."

I have four reasons why I agree with this statement. First, holding a variety of part-time jobs serves to build our experience. For example, if I were to work in a convenience store, I could learn to have a good smile and a good greeting style, or If I were to work in a factory, I could learn patience and understand how appliances are made by the factory. We can receive many diverse experiences by doing part-time jobs. Second, if I hold a variety work part-time jobs, I can find a fitting future job or major. For example, I work at an institute for my money, but fortunately I can find my job by working in an institute that teaches for students. Then I can decide my dream. Also, I can endeavor for my dream and I don't need to wander anymore. Third, I can know the value and concept of money. If I were hardly earning any money, the money I had would be priceless. Therefore, I can't waste the money. I try to save the money and know my parent's difficulty in earning money. Finally, Steve Jobs said ""Connect the dots"", so I take on a variety of part-time jobs that surely someday will help me. In conclusion, I assert that part-time jobs are necessary for college students."

I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, they should work in order to maintain their livelihood. There are many students who under financial difficulty. We can't live if we do not eat. If there is no energy, no life can live. The second reason is conversation skills. It is very important because we need social skill to succeed in society. We should talk to other people to get what we need. It will allow us to learn from real life rather than from a teacher. I believe that part-time jobs help to improve this skill. The last reason is to reinforce our university major. I hope that if you want to have a part-time job, you will consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help you. For example, my major is English literature. To study English and to improve my ability, I will find a part-time job which is related to English. For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

In my case when I was a freshman, I worked for Lotto Riau as a part-time worker for one year. My parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and earn a little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than if I didn't have it. There was a bad aspect. It meant I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought about whether I would stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young, so I had many chances in the future and I had to go to the army. Now I don't regret it. If I was a freshman, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is a well-spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be more successful than someone with no experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young."

As you know, if we enter new circumstances, we can meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things, whether you like each person or not. Second, I could gain good skills from a part-time job. If you work in a restaurant kitchen, you could learn to cook well. Also, if you work in an apparel store in a department store, you could give people good service and could match clothes well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily.

They even think that the teenagers who have part-time jobs are delinquent students. I think they are prejudiced. Teenagers with part-time jobs can learn about economic strength. Besides, part-time jobs have some other benefits for teenagers. So, in my opinion, having a job when they are still students is a good way for teenagers to learn about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree with the teenagers having their jobs. First, teenagers can know the value of money as they earn money themselves. Most of the teenagers and children get pocket money from their parents, but they don't do anything in order to earn money. They don't know how much their parents worked or where the money comes from. If they have part-time jobs, they can know about these things. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and personal economics. For example, teens working in some place like 'Starbucks' can see a lot of different kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn modes of speech, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, the right values can be established in them. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking garages, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks or by doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers having part-time jobs."

First, college tuition is more expensive nowadays than it was in the past. The cost is a burden to many ordinary people -both students and their parents. For this reason, students should work to make money for their college tuition. If students make money for tuition, it will reduce the financial burden for college tuition. Alternatively, students need to make their own pocket money, because college students are adults. Now, they need to embrace their time of economic independence and no longer get money from their parents. Second, to have a part-time job is to gain indirect experience of social life before we join adult society. For this experience, we learned that earning money is very hard, as I have experienced before. We will also experience human relationships of social life. In this society, lots of diverse people are represented in our society. Through this we can learn how to handle these people. Through meeting diverse people, we can learn development of relationships in broader society. To conclude, to have a part-time job gives students many experiences before they join adult society."

I would like to discuss low wages, behavior of superiors, and the absence of break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea, and when I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress. When I was at work the manager treated me badly. He swore at me and shouted at me in front of people. At work, break time was not guaranteed. If the manager saw me moving slowly he would tell me to walk faster or to run. Of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid on time. Regarding the behavior of managers or superiors at work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case, as I said, the manager used to swear at part-time staff. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible, because part-time workers are people, too. They do not deserve that kind of treatment. My opinion is that the relationship between part-time workers and superiors should be improved for good. The second problem is that break time is not guaranteed. Humans require food, sleep, etc. to live, but at the part-time job employers want workers to work until their shift is done. That might increase profits, but it is a good way to lose people."

Second, it can help us to experience our society. It will help you learn how to conduct yourself at your company and how to face your boss. Also, you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parents birthday gifts if I save monthly, and not depend on my parents to be grown up. Nowadays university fees are very expensive, too, so that is why students look for part-time jobs. Another reason is society experience. Many people graduate with no social experience, and that can be problem when adjusting to working in a company. To face one's boss, it takes a lot of courage because the boss can fire you at any time. At school we have friends and at work we can make friends too. Making friends at work can help me adapt to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree with students' doing part-time jobs."

First, a part-time job offers students a lesson on the importance of money. They will get money through hard work. Therefore, they will spend less money and save more money. College students usually spend money drinking and enjoying time with friends, so they spend money easily. This lesson can save money from their wastefulness. Second, students receive a lot of money from their parents. Registration fees are very expensive, but many students' fees are paid by their parents. If students get money to cover their own expenses, parents will be appreciative. Accordingly, students need to make the money to use on their own. Finally, students get priceless experiences through a part-time job. After graduating from college, they will work at a company and experience many things at their company.

Part-time job experience is to be commended, because a part-time worker meets many people and gains experience. Here are some reasons why students should have a part-time job. First, the part-time job experience is going to teach sociability and allow them to meet many people. Because many part-time jobs are customer-facing these days, sociability is very important. Many customers like to have highly socially-skilled workers. Therefore, many employers choose to have employees with developed social skills. Second, the part-time job is going to earn much money. Many students receive pocket money from their parents, so they haven't any part-time job experience or experience earning money. When they receive earned money, they are going to be pleased. Finally, they get experience of many part-time jobs. These days Korea has many kinds of job, so students are going to get experience.

However, they don't have any ability to pay these fees, so their parents have to shoulder the entire cost instead of them. If students work at part-time jobs, they would lighten their parents' burden. I think it is also one of the ways to help one's parents. The other reason why I agree with it is that it can help to gain a lot of experience for students' careers. For employment, many companies demand lots of careers of students. It would be good experience to have part-time jobs. Also, students who work part-time jobs can learn how to treat people and to interact socially. In addition, they can develop personality traits like diligence, manners, common sense, and partnership. That's why it is important for college students have a part-time job.

But I think that a person going to college should have part-time job for two reasons. First, they can help their parents who find it difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money they earn can't cover all the tuition, but the money is not only tangible money. It shows care for their parents. And they can use the money they earned their allowance. We can see this as a small thing, but it is a big thing and a source of pride for them. Second, they can go through out of the college. That is important.

Of course, this behavior gives them a lot of time that they can spend on self-improvement. However, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. There are some reasons why I agree with this idea. First, college students can keep the spirit of independence. For example, they endure hard work for a month to earn money. These processes encourage them and foster their independence. In addition, the survey of the student council shows that students who experience part-time jobs have independence about four times higher than students who didn't experience part-time jobs. Second, college students are able to pay their school expenses. According to a civic organization's survey, seventy percent of college students pay their registration fees in installments with the money they earn for themselves during vacations. Third, to have a part-time job can make college students very organized and offer useful skills. It is reported that employees who experience part-time jobs quickly adjust to new environments compared with employees who didn't experience part-time jobs. In addition, college students who have part-time jobs can obtain skills that help them find a job.

For example, one of my college friends has a part-time job for her tuition. After finishing school, she goes to her part time job right away. Second, we can gain lots of experience about many jobs before we have our own jobs. For example, when we are college students, some students don't know what kind of jobs they want to have after graduating college, so having a part-time job is a good setting for some students to think about what they want to be after graduating college. Third, having a part time-job is important for college students to have socialization. Of course, they can have socialization when they are in a college, but this is not enough for them.

I have many bases for my opinion. Most college students don't go to school near their homes; they live near the college. This requires lots of money. Naturally, this life imposes a heavy burden on their parents. We have a lot of time while we are at college. When we leave home, if you have a part-time job, you lessen the burden on your parents, and a part time job offers many experiences. You can work in many kinds of occupation through part-time jobs. You will meet many different people in various workplaces. I think that's the most important thing. A part-time job makes it possible to understand economic activities as you manage spending and income yourself. At first it is hard, but as time goes by you will feel that it's easy. It's practice for your future social life. I think a part time job has many advantages. You don't spend free time on other things when you have a part time job. I recommend working; do not study everyday all the time. It's a greater help than library life to you. It gives many things to you. It's hard to work, but it doesn't disappoint you; I'm confident in it."

For these reasons, I think it is a very good way to gain experience. I have had several part-time jobs. They were very hard experiences, but it was a great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked in a department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit right away, but I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at a theater. It was a very interesting time, but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money accurately, the theater earned money. I also worked at a buffet restaurant. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tips, so I thought it was a cool job. A few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too, because middle school students did not listen to my lessons. I think that the many jobs that I have experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part-time jobs too."

I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to gain experience before getting a job. For example, if students who have finished university get a job and have to work hard, they cannot work effectively because they have not enough experience. In university, no one teaches executive abilities. Second, lots of Korean students do not know the value of money since lots of Korean university students get pocket money from their parents. I think people who have never experienced part-time jobs do not know the value of money. Third, having a part-time job allows students to know about spending money. I think a lot of students do not have experience working in a part-time job and they do not know how to manage spending money because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. Because of this, it is a good experience for a university student to work in a part time job. The last thing is that they can get to know lots of people. If students work part-time jobs, they can get to know a lot of workers other than general university students. In Korea, it is important to know the people who are in the same field. Consequentially, I agree with working part-time jobs for university students."

That's why we need part time jobs, Although some do it because they do need money, I say part time jobs are good experience for all of us. But they can be bad if the students try to make part time jobs their ongoing jobs. Some don't go to school at all because of this approach. Anyway, even with all their hard effort trying to earn, the regular wage rules are not being kept. My friend was working in an internet cafe for 3000 won an hour. It's not fair. How can he make a living out of it? The hourly rate should be increased or people should observe the rules.

Now, some students do live off of their own parents' money, which is fine if they are that fortunate. However, if they don't have a need to work, these students should be involved in a club or some type of other activity. There's a lot of responsibility that goes into running an organization on campus and it can help students remained grounded in a similar way that a regular, paying job would. Ultimately, anything that keeps students from becoming lazy is a good thing. Holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. Students will enjoy their work, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on their studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success: time management. If students keep their priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least tolerable, students will be adding an important element to their future resume."

Me either. I think we should go abroad or experience many things we haven't done instead of studying all day or working every day and staying at home. I insist it is important to do a part time job, but I hate how we have to do a part-time job. Anyway, we can learn many things from doing part time jobs, such as endurance, responsibility and conversation skills. I think these are much more important than the money we earn from doing part-time jobs. We can also learn how to use our time efficiently. To be at work on time, we schedule. That is how we learn to use our time. In addition, typically it's boring to do a part-time job, so I do some exercise or read a newspaper when I am free at work. You don't? But I do!"

It is very helpful and very important for students to get a job, even though they don't have to get a part-time job to earn money. I will explain to you that why it is important. First, you can meet various people. Of course, you can meet people at your school but there is a difference between people whom you would meet at your workplace and people whom you would meet at your school. I think talking with various people gives you a lot of ideas. Also, you could have a chance to get information which you want to get. If you do a part-time job that is related to your future work, you can meet some people who have some information you need. It is more advantageous than other people who don't have a part-time job. Second, you earn money having a part-time job, so you can realize how important money is and how to spend money. You could develop a habit of saving money because you don't want to waste the money you earned. Some students waste money, but most students don't waste the money they earned themselves. Thus I think during your college days, doing a part-time job is very helpful, valuable, and worthwhile thing. I recommend you to do a part-time job while you are in university."

However, if students start social lives without social experience, they will have difficulty. Therefore, having a social life in advance is a good thing. Also, nowadays, when companies hire people, they prefer experienced people. In order to get a job, students need more social experience. Next, the second reason is that they can live without the help of their parents. They can earn money and appreciate their parents. Today, a lot of students need the help of their parents, so a lot of parents help their child. However, when students have a part-time job, they don't need the help of their parents. Finally, they can build friendships. They have to meet a lot of people and talk to them because dealing with people is difficult in social life. People dislike unkind, unfriendly, and rude people, so, they can learn how to act kind and friendly. Although there are a lot of reasons, I think this is the most important reason.

In my opinion, college students having a part-time job is not important. It is dependent on condition. If you are rich enough, you don't have to worry about paying for tuition. If you are not, you must be a part-time worker. You can't afford to pay for tuition, which means you are not rich, so you have to get a loan to attend college. Then you have a debt, and repay it yourself, because you are not child anymore and can't bother your parents to pay tuition. However, there is an exception, which is a scholarship. Theoretically, receiving a scholarship is easy. You can just study hard and participate in a party or festival that you belong to, but my experience, receiving a scholarship for four years is very difficult . So, I have had a part-time job since I was 20. Therefore, if you cannot study hard, and are not rich, you have no choice. You must find a part-time job.

Tuition is very high in my country, so some students take time off from school to earn their tuition. Other students have part-time jobs and go to school at the same time in order to supplement tuition. Also, college students need more money to get together with their friends and enjoy cultural life. They usually earn extra money by doing a part-time job. The second reason is they live by themselves. Some students, especially men, are expected to earn money to live without economical help from their parents. They must achieve financial independence, so they have to have part-time job to live. Therefore, having a part-time job is obligatory for some students in this situation. The third reason is students experience all kinds of things through a part-time job.

My friend worked for a long time at one company when she was a college student, and then she could get a job there. Second, students always feel that college fees are very expensive. So, they need a lot of money for college life, but they cannot work for a long time or every day because they are students and students have to study. Finally, they can learn the value of money. Today, we live with a richness of everything. If we want something or want to change our telephone or watch, we can get it from parents or somebody else. So, we don't know the value of money.

Some people who advocate for having a casual job believe that it helps the students not only financially but also mentally. Other people argue that it is too hard for them to allocate the time to balance between study and work. In this essay, it will discuss both of advantages and disadvantages of having a part-time job. Firstly, there are various advantages to working part-time for university students, who will go into the outside world soon after graduation. The experience of working during their studies will make them better equipped with not only academics from school but also practice from their working experience. It will also give them freedom from financial dependency on their parents. Even though the amount of money they earn is not a lot, it will take some burden off of their parents' shoulders. Secondly, the most important output would be learning social skills by confronting or dealing with people outside of school. Through this kind of experience, university students will learn some skills that they cannot learn from textbooks. Interacting with people outside school will provide them with greater confidence and opportunities to see the real world. People standing against the argument, however, claim that most students will fail to allocate their time properly when balancing between study and work. Moreover, interacting with their peers is very crucial while they are still developing their character. For example, having money on their mind and thinking about everything in terms of monetary value will overshadow some valuable things in life, such as teaching poor children for free or doing volunteer work for underdeveloped countries. In conclusion, in my opinion, the advantages of working part-time outweigh the disadvantages greatly. However, we still cannot ignore the negative effects, so we should try to minimize the disadvantages to the greatest extent without sacrificing the advantages."

Working experience is really important for getting a job. Also, students can learn to respect other people. The second reason is students can gain valuable insight about a career. Before I go into my real field of work, I need to learn skills and knowledge of the work place, and I want to see which job really fits me. The last reason is to earn money. Many people who are University students want to get their own money so they can buy pretty clothes and eat good food. However, we shouldn't only concentrate on getting money because we are still students. We have to focus on studying our subjects. Working for money might hinder our focus on studies because it takes a lot of valuable time. I think the best solution is to get money on vacation and study during the semester.

I think these experiences are a benefit of part time work. Next, students can learn the importance of money. Since I was a high school student, I have always lived with pocket money given to me by my parents and I didn't know it was hard to make money. After becoming 20, I have worked hard to earn about 5000-6000won per hour and now I think carefully when I spend money, even just drinking a cup of coffee or eating a spoonful of ice cream.

In Korea, the cigarette price is 2,700 won. With this money, we can give water, rice, bread and new life to poor children. That is, spending money on more valuable things can help someone. Second, secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. Smokers already know that, however they do not care about others' health, even in their own family. For example, about 600,000 people are killed by secondhand smoking every year. Especially, fetuses are more damaged and harmed directly by smokers. As a result, secondhand smoking can kill people. Lastly, there are many smoking areas in the country. Because the government could not completely ban smokers from smoking, they made many smoking areas. Therefore, smokers keep this policy because it is at the least some concession to non-smokers. In summary, we can help poor children by stopping smoking, smokers can damage non-smokers' health, and there are many smoking areas available, so I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants."

Thus, I am sure that they are harmful things for both smokers and non-smokers. But, cigarette has the worst effect on non-smokers. You should not do damage to other people. Therefore, you should act responsibly. Second, isolate smoking rooms are available in all buildings. Smoking rooms only allow smoking within the room. For example, all coffee shops, restaurants or PC rooms have smoking rooms attached. So, it is right that you should smoke in the smoking room. Finally, cigarettes contain burning material.

I think that smoking deserves to be banned at all restaurants and bus stations. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at buildings or restaurants."

This is because restaurants are places where people eat and most of the time, restaurants are closed areas. Smoking in closed areas would cause passive smokers to inhale as much pollutants as an active smoker. This would cause many health complications to a person. There are so many adverse effects of smoking. The smoke released could also mean that the pollutant particles from the smoke could end up on the food in the restaurant. This is especially unhealthy for the person who consumes the food. It is all the more unhealthy for a person to eat in a confined area, especially in restaurants. Another question which arises is ""why is it that people should smoke while eating?"" Restaurants are meant to be places where people eat. If there should be a place for people who want to smoke, it must be in a special room for people to smoke and not in restaurants. Smoking should never be allowed in restaurants. Restaurants are places for people to eat and not smoke. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is very unsightly for a restaurant to have people smoking in it."

Smoking can lead to various cancers and other diseases. Because of the number of people of all ages in a restaurant, a smoker causes much damage to children, older people, and pregnant women, as well as other people. Passive smoking is more harmful to our health than smoking. Therefore, passive smoking increases the risk of various cancers and other diseases. This makes non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke very angry. Besides, the smell of smoking is terrible, so the taste of food is lost. Restaurants should make smoking rooms. People who smoke cigarettes mustn't smoke in a restaurant. If they want to smoke, they fill the restaurant with smoke and put many people's health at risk. Also, restaurants need restrictions on smokers. Smokers need more consideration for others in restaurants and they must realize that their smoking is harmful to other people's health."

There are more non-smokers than smokers on campus. Because smokers cause damage to nonsmokers' health, and because smoking is bad for smokers' health, they must quit smoking. For Mandy Soled, college and nicotine go hand in hand. A 20-year-old student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Soled never smoked in high school. She doesn't smoke much over the summer, but as soon as a new semester starts, she is back to four or five cigarettes a day. What is it about college life that lures her to smoke? Stress? Peer pressure? Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. Once you start smoking, it is very hard, but not impossible, to quit. Until recently, I think smoking on college campuses was largely ignored. Alcohol is such a major issue in college that smoking takes a back seat. In the last few years, however, smoking has become a hot topic. One of the reasons for this increased importance is the recognition that the college years are crucial in making or breaking an addiction. As a college student, I have seen firsthand the prevalence of smoking. All across our campus, college students are lighting up at an alarming rate. In a campus survey I conducted of 15 college students in February 2002, eight students said they were current smokers. I surveyed eight males and seven females. My survey included 18 questions revealing gender, age, class, familial history of smoking, frequency of smoking, desire to quit, methods used to quit, awareness of hazards, etc. I surveyed several of my classmates in class, a few sorority sisters in our suite, and random students at the HUB."

There are two reasons why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for our health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous effects associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meals at restaurants because of smokers. When I was having my meal at a restaurant, I couldn't eat anymore because of cigarette smoke in the air, so I stopped eating. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smokers. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human health, as you know, and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is a very important thing and smokers should also not bother non-smokers. So, smoking must be completely forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country."

I'm against all of this. In university, there are so many more smokers than non-smokers. In other words, I disagree with idea of prohibiting smoking in public. So, in my opinion, we don't have to quit smoking. Cigarettes are the smoker's favorite food, just like how someone enjoys the favorite tea or coffee. Just show consideration for non-smokers. For example, smokers should smoke in limited areas. This is common sense. We don't have to quit smoking. But you can get a bad effect to it. First of all, it is dangerous to one's health, and can lead to cancer or other diseases. Second, it can be addictive. And third, it causes the body to smell bad, so many people will keep far away from a smoker. And fourth, there will be much money spent, and it is terribly big amount if it was accumulated. Thus, it is unfair to prohibit smoking in public. If smoking in public is prohibited, the smokers' rights to smoke are ignored. Making a smoking area in public is the best way to respect both smokers and non-smokers. Then, you'd better release to smoke than to quit. Thus, I don't agree with banning smoking."

A variety of groups visit restaurants - kids, juveniles, adults who have quit smoking, old people who don't like the smell of smoke, etc. If kids and juveniles were exposed to smoke or see smoking, smoking is very harmful for them. Some curious kids and juveniles think ""I want to smoke"", and if adults who have quit smoking were to smell the smoke, they may be tempted to smoke again and damage their health. Buying tobacco is expensive, so if smokers were to quit smoking, they would save money and they could spend that money more meaningfully. For example, they could make a donation for Africans who don't have money, food, water, or medicine, and save their life from disease. Or they could spend money on their family household goods. Also tobacco is very addictive - the so-called ""legal drug"". Above all, smoking is very harmful and secondhand smoking is very hazardous for health. I insist that we ban smoking in restaurants. If a smoking ban was not enacted by law, the nation should implement smoking areas. And if they were disobeying the law, the government should punish lawbreakers ruthlessly with considerable penalties including long periods of jail and community service."

I have two reasons. First of all, smokers are more likely to develop cancer. To human cancer, we are experiencing now 30-40 percent of all cancers being caused by tobacco. At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens. The accumulation of carcinogens in tobacco smoke continuously for long periods, depending on the type of cancer, greatly increases the probability of occurrence of cancer. Currently we are experiencing, among all mankind, 30-40% of cancer being caused by cigarettes. Therefore, if the world did not smoke, 30-40% of all cancers would not have occurred. The second reason is another disease: smoking leads to respiratory diseases. If cigarette smoking continues, respiratory function continues to weaken. As a smoker continues to smoke cigarettes, bronchial wall thickening creates a narrowing of bronchus and weakens respiratory function. For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

A few years ago, smoking was not important to all of us. But now, people's thinking has changed. Comedian Lee Jug-el died of lung cancer. To this day, I can't forget about what he said to the public about smoking. He was as smoker for many years. Before he died, he made an authorized advertisement. In the ad, he appealed to people who had been smoking for many years. He said when you are smoking, you have to stop smoking. If you don't stop, that destroys your family and your life. For example, a man is smoking at the restaurant; we think that he is polite. When he is smoking, he doesn't mind everybody in the restaurant. If he has a thought that he�@should take care of his family or friends, he can't smoke there. Now, people don't allow smoke in the building so we can see people who find the smoking area which is outside of building. Also, if someone smokes at a restaurant, cigarette smoke makes the people annoyed. We want to have the food in fresh air and we don't want to die early because of cigarette smoke. So, if you smoke for years, you have to stop smoking for your future, your family, and your friends."

No matter how they feel, it's a really harmful way to act for everybody, including non-smokers. So, I want to insist that we should prohibit smoking cigarettes for several reasons. First, if someone smoke cigarettes next to others, the bystanders couldn't avoid the potential dangers. We always advise smokers that their children and family could face a potentially harmful situation; their family could have lung cancer, and could get some respiratory disease. For their own family, smokers always think of smoking cigarettes. Second, when someone smokes cigarettes, they can't easily stop smoking because of their addiction. According to several pieces of research, when smokers stop smoking, their hands may shake or they may gain weight suddenly. If they continue to smoke cigarettes, they would be more likely to get mental and physical disease compared to non-smokers. I totally agree that the government should make cigarette prices higher. If it spontaneously makes smokers decrease their intake, the cigarette market will have to get more tax and fix product prices higher."

First of all, other people's health is very important. If people smoke at restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the elderly and babies present, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarettes smell very bad and it can make people feel unpleasant. The people have a right to enjoy good smells at a restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at restaurants, the restaurants' environment can become dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarettes can go into the food. Also, the restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarettes.

If humans smoke cigarettes, the smoke get into the lungs and causes cancer. But this danger is greater for non-smokers than for smokers, because non-smokers inhale the toxic materials without a filter. For this reason, smoking has a bad effect for non-smokers. Many people who divide into non-smokers or smokers are gathered in restaurants and public places in the country. At the restricted place, non-smokers will inhale toxic material against their wishes. So, the action of smoking in restaurants or public places has bad effects for non-smokers. They are exposed to a greater death rate than smokers for passive smoking. In conclusion, because of this dangerous effect, smoking - which damages our health - should be restricted for the health of non-smokers at restaurants and in public places."

Recently the cost of Dunhill brand cigarettes has been raised to reduce the rate of smoking, but people who smoked Dunhills changed their brand to a cheaper brand. Secondly, smoking areas are not appointed well, which causes people to smoke in bus stops, inside buildings, and in public areas. In Canada, it is illegal to smoke inside buildings and in public areas. This should be put into action in Korea. And the last issue is secondhand smoking. This issue is related to the smoking area issue. I guess most people know that secondhand smoking is worse than smoking, and secondhand smoking can cause cancer and skin disease.

In accordance with these contents, I think all places must have a space for smokers only. Restaurants are not an exception. Besides, a restaurant is a place to eat, but if someone is smoking other people get displeased. So all smokers should be smoking in their place so as not to cause harm to other nonsmokers."

Of course, it seems to relieve their mind to smoke cigarettes. However, I disagree that smokers may smoke in public places as well as the entire restaurant. I think that smoking should be completely banned at public place in this country. There are some reasons supporting my idea. First, passive smokers are more likely to get cancer compared with non-smokers and smokers. According to a WHO report, passive smokers are always exposed to fatal disease like cancer and they are at risk of getting cancer three times to four times compared with non-smokers and smokers. Second, to smoke cigarettes costs a lot of social expense. The survey of the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that smoking areas are the most expensive to clean because of time and employees. Third, smoking can cause dangerous accidents like fires. According to the National Emergency Management Agency, fires in restaurants have been caused by carelessly thrown away cigarette butts. As a result, many people are injured by this situation. For these reasons, I absolutely assert that smoking should be banned all places except smoking areas in the country."

Let's see some reasons. First of all, there are lots of people who don't like the smell of smoking. For example, a month ago, I went to a restaurant near a mountain. On one hand, I liked the place because of the air around it; on the other hand, I saw a person who was smoking in the restaurant, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. I really hate the smell of smoking and when I smell it, I get a headache, so it was terrible dinner due to that person. Secondly, secondhand smoking is fatal for people's health. As you know, secondhand smoking is much worse than smoking. Therefore, smoking in public place affects other people who are in public place as well as the smoker Thirdly, there is a possibility of a fire. In this case, many people who are in the public place are going to die. Fourthly, smoking in public places makes young people or children have curiosity about it or makes them want to smoke. That's why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

I think most people agree, too. Restaurants are public places, not private places. I don't think smoking is bad; smoking in restaurants is bad. Non-smokers are harmed by smokers because of secondhand smoking. I have seen that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking in the news. Smoking in restaurants exposes other people to disease. The target could be your own family. Imagine one case; today is a family dinner. Your son sits next to you. You start smoking, and your son breathes your smoke. Your son is non-smoker. What does your son think about you? Maybe he feels shame, because he has a conscience. He thinks your smoking in restaurants is wrong. Don't you agree? Everyone knows smoking in restaurants is not good - child, adult, teenager, or elderly. You must mostly think about people's health. Don't smoke in restaurants only for your pleasure. If you want to smoke during a meal, then go outside and smoke; that is manners. Nowadays almost all restaurants have a smoking room. Your few steps will be other persons' happiness. For most persons' happiness, smoking in restaurants should be banned and smokers must observe this law. That's a win-win strategy for both sides."

This is a sign that we can see everywhere. Ironically, we can also see many people smoking freely. Definitely, smoking is the issue in our country and the world. These days many countries ban smoking in official places and in other places. In Korea, we also ban smoking in many places, but I think smokers don't care about this rule. I really don't like the smell of smoking, so if someone smokes in the street my face is going to be frowning. I insist that we should make some rules like smokers have to smoke in restricted areas. It is a very great idea, I think. Many non-smokers are bothered because of smoking. It is very harmful to people's health and to our habitat. Cigarettes contain very toxic material, so people can't quit easily. I think that cigarette companies should increase cigarette prices, and then many people can quit their smoking habit more easily. It is a good idea that advertisers make many ads about not smoking. I hope many smokers can quit their smoking habit so other people can be safe everywhere and all the time. I don't know well how hard it is for smokers to quit smoking because I'm not a smoker. Although it is very hard to quit smoking, you should quit as soon as possible for your health. Maybe you can ask a doctor how to quit your smoking habit if you really want to quit your smoking habit."

According to the news on the Korean TV, smokers cannot smoke in public areas from 2013. I have four reasons for supporting the statement. First of all, if smokers smoke in restaurants, they influence other customers. Suppose other customers in the restaurant eating some food and smokers are smoking next to their table. The customers really do not like smell and it is disgusting. I think it is not good smoking in public areas. Second, smoking is not good for our health. According to a newspaper I saw, smoking damages smokers' lungs and they cannot live as long as non-smokers. Smoking take a toll on the lungs and prompts cancer of the lungs and lots of other disease. Third, if smokers are smoking in restaurants, other non-smokers are damaged from smokers. I am referring to second-hand smoking. I read some result of the second-hand smoking. It said that non-smokers are damaged if they smell tobacco. I was surprised about that result. The last reason not to allow smoking in restaurants is I think the most important thing in a restaurant is cleanliness. If smokers are smoking in the restaurant, lots of places in the store are dirtier than in a non-smoking restaurant because smoking makes the place dirty. Finally, I think smoking must be banned in restaurants."

I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. But students smoking? That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. Yes, that is true, it does make someone who's smoking look cool. But is looking cool to other people worth more than their own health? Lots of people regret smoking when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. For example, I saw kindergarten children smoking, not outside, but on the internet. They were spitting saliva out of their mouths. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to a hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again, cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, our country will suffer damage in the financial losses. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking. I just hope it doesn't get worse than this."

Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also setting bad examples for teens and young adults. Also, scientists agree that smoking is dangerous. Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby who breathe in the smoke. This is called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. People should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do not choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public."

You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually, you pay for disease. What a silly idea! I work out, so I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking can also ruin families. Parents need to stop smoking for their children. Last week I saw something about smoking in a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else I can say is smoking is worse for other people than it is for the smoker! In addition, smoking makes people stink. Who would want to hang out with a smelly person? Right?

When I wait for a bus at the bus stop, I smell smokers' smoke. It is so bad, smoking near non-smokers. Sometimes, I went to restaurants, cafes and campus. I think that smoking is an unpleasant thing. The government must make non-smoking areas and introduce a smoking penalty system. When I am an adult, I will ban smoking for my children, because it is so bad for a mom with a baby. Smoking is also banned in playgrounds and kindergarten. This gives health benefits. I saw on television that a famous comedian died because of smoking. I was so scared when I saw his death.

As you know, smoking causes so many disease, like lung cancer, tuberculosis, other cancers, etc. Its effects are not limited to smokers, but non-smokers are exposed to second hand smoke, too. Here is reason that why smoking should be banned in public places. First, it causes much disease. If it is banned to smoke in public place, it could reduce the smoking rate. As a result, many people could be healthier. It is very easy for second hand smoke to get a disease from second hand smoking. So I think it should be banned to smoke in public places. Second, if it is banned, it could make for cleaner streets. Usually people who smoke throw away butts on the street. Even though there are so many smoking stands, they don't use them, as if it is very natural act. But I think if it were banned, they couldn't throw away a cigarette. So it would make street clean. Third, if it is banned, it could prevent a big fire. Sometimes the cigarette you threw away could make a big fire. Of course, there are fires of other origins, but I think if you don't smoke in public places it also could reduce the fire rate. Thus I think smoking in public place should be banned by government. If this does not happen, it could make people get diseases, it could make streets unclean and uncomfortable, and it could also make a big fire. So I believe that it should be banned to smoke in public places."

Today, a lot of countries have banned smoking in public places, but still a lot of countries haven't banned smoking in public places. I will state reasons why we should ban smoking in restaurants and public places. I have three reasons. First, smoking damages other people. Smoking is a personal freedom, but smoking in restaurants interferes with the freedom of others. Second, smoking is bad for children's education and health. A lot of different people come to restaurants. There are men, women, and children. When a child comes to the restaurant, if the guest sitting next to the child smokes, it is bad for the child's health and education. Finally, other guests receive unpleasant feelings from smoking, especially in restaurants. They eat delicious food, but smell bad smoke. They do not like the smell. Also, they want to get the natural taste of the food. If mixed together with smoke, they can't get the natural taste of the food. For these reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the world."

The problem is that there are smoking areas. They banned smoking, but they have smoking areas, which is ironic. Smoking should be banned in public places. Especially at restaurants. First of all, there are non-smokers. Non-smokers don't want to smell cigarette smoke. They are going to eat lunch or supper, not cigarettes. Even if smokers sit in their area, the smell is there, and I would feel like I was eating disgusted garbage. If you eat dinner with a smoker, it is a disaster. Because of the smoker, you will be in the smoking area. Non-smokers have to smell uncomfortable cigarette smoke. In my case, I really hate breathing another person's smoke. Second, smoking causes toxic diseases. As you know, smoking can cause lung cancer And can damage non-smokers' health more than smokers'. Non-smokers just want to enjoy their dinner, but they also receive a bad gift from smokers. Smoking produces all evil and no good. Some smokers say that if people don't like them to smoke, they can leave, but I think it would be better for them to quit smoking. Cigarettes are a kind of drug. I wish smokers would stop smoking."

Lately, the notion of third-hand smoke has appeared. I have seen TV programs about third-hand smoke. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous things are found on the skin of the baby. The research shows that the baby has the same amount of dangerous remnants as adult smokers. I was shocked by the results of this research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the danger of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public areas where any person can drop by and eat there. In these areas, non-smokers are easily affected by smokers. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking on others. The government should take action for the health of all citizens."

Maybe, the young boy will learn to smoke from the smokers and the baby will breathe air with smoke from smokers. The young boy and baby could be your son or daughter, so it is very dangerous and makes you angry. Next, some countries use fire on tables, such as Korean soup, Japanese soup, and United Kingdom royal dessert. So, today, in restaurants with these foods, we can see fire on the table.

Those people do not deserve a right to think about an existence without agony. I think it is really absurd. God gave us a mind to think for ourselves, and do what is right for us. Expecting to have a great life while smoking your lungs out is really ridiculous and silly. The main substance that is used in a cigarette is tobacco. First it is burned, then it is inhaled into a person's body. When it settles down and finds a place for itself in the lungs, it forms black holes, which lead to lung cancer. Therefore, I really recommend people stop smoking. You might ask, “why do people sell cigarettes?” Simple: Money. That is the answer; instead of thinking about other people's health, they need the money. However, from the very beginning of your life, safety and health was the most important thing, and it still is. Let's say some people don't really care about their own health, so they think it's okay to smoke, but smoking also harms the people around you. When you inhale smoke, you don't keep it in your lungs; You exhale it back out. Therefore, that smoke can affect other people's lungs too. Smoking is the most popular drug. It is also considered to be addictive. We all don't want to lose our lives like this.

First, smoking is not good for our health. Smoke is made up of various toxic chemical ingredients and is a cause of disease, as well as not being good for health. Also, smoking is especially not good for the lungs. So, it becomes hard to breathe during activities like exercise or singing. Next, non-smoking people in restaurants would become targets of second-hand smoke if we allow smoking in restaurants. I heard that second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoking first-hand. Maybe, there are weak persons such as children, pregnant women, or the elderly in the restaurant. These weaker people never want to breathe second-hand smoke because it is very harmful for them. These days, almost all cafeterias are divided into two places, one for smoking and one for non-smokers. I think dividing space into two places is one good solution but it is hard to have a perfect effect. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, or if there are smoking rooms outside the restaurants."

I think that there are many ways to answer that question. A part-time job can be done in part of your time. So college students can do a part-time job when they have spare time (if they want). There are many reasons why college students might do a part-time job. The first is that they need more money to have fun and pay the studying costs, and the second is that they need to get work experience for the future. College students might need more money because, sometimes, the college student's money from their parents is not enough. So, they will search for a part-time job. Why a part-time job? Because their study time can't be compromised with a regular job, and they will need a part-time job that has unusual work times, so they can combine their studying with working at a part-time job. After college students graduate from university, it is difficult to search for a job because the company that needs workers will ask for job experiences related to the new job. Therefore, if they do not have any experience, it will be difficult to find a job. Therefore, work experience from a part-time job will be very helpful. I prefer to agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job. It will give you experiences for the future after graduation, except if you do not plan to work in the future."

It will make the students become independent people. The students will get income from the salary of their job to pay their living costs. They will not have to bother their parents or spend so much of their parents' money. Moreover, the students will become disciplined because they will learn how to manage their time well; they will know when they have to study and when they have to work. In a part-time job, the workers cannot arrive late, so it forces the students as workers to be on time in their job. Not only that, a part-time job can also develop the student's knowledge. So, after getting lessons from college, the students can apply their knowledge directly in their job. Furthermore, the students can use their time well, so they can avoid wasting time having fun and shopping, and they will only use their time for useful activities. Therefore, as having a part-time job is very useful and important for college students, all students in the college should spend their time working at a part-time job."

As we know, the cost of college is expensive for students. It's easy if the parents of that student are rich. But, how about for students with poor parents? A part-time job is a solution for this situation. The student can help the parents avoid spending too much money, and the students will have new experiences beside their daily activity of studying. The students must learn how to split their time between studying and having a part-time job. They can also be proud to get their money by themselves instead of asking for money from their parents. In my opinion, they are independent students. If all college students had to do a part-time job, I think parents wouldn't have financial problems. And for those students, it can be a good start for when they work at a company after graduating from that college. We could say that they are training to get a new skill for a job, so it's a positive thing for the student. In this era, if we can, why not?

Managing our time is important if we do not want to lose something. So, having a part-time job is important for college students because we can get many advantages from it. If we believe we can do it, then why not? But, we have to remember that studying is our priority; therefore, even though we have a part-time job, we cannot be lazy about studying because we can get experience, and we can get used to living in society besides as a student.

College students need some money to live their life without asking for money from their parents. They must begin to develop their independence to provide their necessities by themselves.

They can show their families that they can do things by themselves and actively training themselves to fit into society in the future and be useful for those around them. Therefore, at a part-time job, they can show their skills that they get from their studies at university or other skills they have. It can make a creative contribution to our government.

Besides getting a good enough salary from their part time job, they want to have experiences, challenges, friends, network, and enjoy their young life before they really start life in the working world. University students who take a part-time job would be wise to set their time between their duty as a university student and their part-time job. Actually, it is not easy, but when they decide to take a part-time job, they already thought hard about the positive sides and the negative sides. They also should have permission from their parents to get a part-time job. My friend works as private teacher in her spare time, and she is good at time management and enjoys her work.

But now we are college students, we have to manage our time wisely, and we should consider that doing a part-time job can give us many advantages. With a part-time job, we can help our parents earn money. And, instead of collecting money, we can get wonderful experiences from doing a part-time job.

Many companies look for people who have experience of a part-time job because they are not awkward when they work at the company, and they can do the job very well.

Working a part-time job that is in accordance with our interests will be more enjoyable. And most importantly, after college, we will certainly not become unemployed again because we can work. And even if we have to get a new job, we are more adaptable because we are familiar with working. When they work part time, students also get a salary from the job, so that educates students to become independent and not to bother their parents.

Part-time jobs allow college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems. Besides money, part-time jobs also give students work experience. When we enter the working world, experiences are a good asset for us. Those assets can be gained by doing part-time jobs. For example, in some restaurants, we can see many part-time workers working as waiters. Those waiters can get communication experiences while serving the customers. Part-time jobs can also improve some essential skills such as time management. Part-time workers must manage their time so their work schedules do not clash with their college schedule. Also, they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. Part-time jobs can be helpful for college students.

That is one factor that requires students to have a part-time job, especially university students. They must have a part-time job. Why do I say it like that? First, because not all students at university have parents who can afford to pay for them. Second, if we have a part-time job, we can learn how to manage our time. Third, if we have a part-time job, we can help our parents pay for our studies at university. We can live by ourselves, and we do not always have to live with other people, especially our parents.

Some college students sometimes have a part-time job to fulfill their ambitions to be richer, but I think studying is more important for college students than doing a part-time job because the smarter they are, the faster they will finish their course, and they will save more money because they do not need to repeat their course.

In fact, it is not their obligation to look for money, but this is a kind of demand for their life. They need money for their life. So, there is a reason why some people need to have a part-time job and others do not. Sometimes, we find that college students have a part-time job to complete their necessities such as living costs and college administration. And we also found some college students do it to search for an experience for their future and have a better life, and some only want to fill in their free time or have fun. So, in my opinion, having a part-time job is important for college students. Besides helping their parents, they can learn how to manage their time and their finances in their life from now on."

First of all, they will learn how to manage their money effectively. When working part time, they will get more money and they can reduce their parent's burden by helping to pay their school fees. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. The student will learn how to manage their time too. They will learn how to divide their time between work and study. This way, they will become an expert in time management if they can balance their part-time work with their studies. Also, their time won't be wasted doing activities that aren't important or are unproductive. And finally, the students will get more friends outside of the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least in a different crowd of people. But if you work outside the university, you will meet lots of new people; making new friends can be refreshing when university becomes a bit stale and suffocating. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits than drawbacks for people who work part-time while studying."

Part-time jobs can give experience to students, but they can also increase students' laziness to gain knowledge in lectures and prevent students from completing tasks well. Working part-time fosters a lazy mind, a desire to pursue money, and develops envy, spite, selfishness, and arrogance. Thoughts of chasing money are actually very good for the students future work when they need to demonstrate perseverance at work. I think the better part-time work is that directly supervised by the college, where the work is equated with the task of lectures. With that formula, students can feel how hard the atmosphere in employment is and foster independence while also becoming more cautious in their work. The students can also consult directly with the supervisor or lecturer of the course if there is a problem in the job. Part-time jobs that have been set by the college are not expected to disrupt the student's learning and will fostering positive thoughts. In general, I support the idea of part-time work for college students on the condition that the job will not lead to failure in their studies."

The first benefit is that it can increase their work experience before they have a real job. Students need to know how to act in the workplace, what they must do, and how to use their abilities at work. And they need to know too how to talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn socialism at their workplace. The second benefit is to help their parents with their school funds. Having a part-time job can help students decrease their parents works, or increase their monthly income. It is useful for poor families that have a low monthly income. The third benefit is that it can help a student prepare for when they have a real job, so they will not be surprised when they feel something different from working; the level of difficulties between real life in the workplace and college life is really different. At college, we only get frustrated from the homework or things related to studying, but at work we can get frustrated by our boss, our rivals, or even our friends."

In some countries, part-time jobs are considered a form of learning to merge with society, learn about the working environment, and gain new experiences. Indonesian people have many different opinions about part-time jobs. Some think that part-time jobs are not necessary and students should focus on their college work. They think that the experience of working can be learned later after their education is finished. Some parents think that working can disturb the learning process of their children, while others think that working can make their children unwillingly continue their study as they will prefer working to learning. I have two different points of view. Firstly, I agree that working can be used as the media of learning for society. Students will be able to see and understand many new conditions, levels of work, and increase their funds. By receiving a salary from working, students can help their parents indirectly because they can use their salary for their daily needs. But working is not recommended for students who are already too busy with assignments and activities. Some colleges force students to study by giving them a lot of tasks. Some students get into the organization of extracurricular activities such as sports. If they are already busy with their work, it will become a burden for the students to work at a part-time job. I conclude that part-time work can be effective for certain people."

So, as a way to help their parents, college students should spend some of their time working at a part-time job. And talking about a part-time job, there is a great variety of jobs, ranging from looking after a shop to helping at a local farm. While it has its own difficulties, looking after a shop might be an easy option, but taking care of a farm's animals or crops will require a lot of energy, some extra skills, and knowledge. The variety of payment that a college student can have is also different. Some jobs will not give you much but other jobs will be rewarding. The problem with having a part-time job is that, if you cannot manage your time, you will not have time to study or do some homework and this will have a bad effect on your study results. So, time management when you have a part-time job is very important. Here are some tips: try to find a part-time job that will not require your entire week since studying and rest are very necessary, and find a job that you can really do well. I think that would be all."

Working part-time does not mean you have to be a teacher; there are many other jobs. We can look for them on the Internet or ask for help at the CAC (Career Assistance Center at our university). Or, we can ask for recommendations from friend who already have a part-time job. Working part time doesn't mean we have to work while we are studying. We can work part time during the holidays, so we don't waste our time lazing around not knowing what to do. By working part time, we can get some activity to do, and we can get money to lessen the burden on our parents. Working part time also gives us experience. However, later, when we are looking for a job to fulfill our needs, we can write our part-time job on our CV. So, it's important for us as college students to have a part-time job.

First, part-time jobs can be useful for students to gain additional experience. Besides getting experience at their university, they can also get experience outside of the university by taking a part-time job. The worlds of work and study are totally different. Part-time jobs give students a lot of benefits, for example, they become aware that when they graduate they will work like they work at a part-time job. Hence, they will be accustomed to working and will not get shocked about how hard the world of work is. Also, they will find out how hard it is to make and collect money by working at a part-time job. Second, by taking a part-time job, students can learn to manage their time well. Taking a part-time job means that students are ready to balance their energy, time, and mind. A part-time job takes up a lot of time. So, students should be able to manage their time well, so it does not interfere with the time needed for studying, or doing homework or assignments. Last, a part-time job is very useful for students who have a lot of leisure time because they can apply their leisure time for useful things. They can do a part-time job when they have finished studying. Part-time jobs can be done by each student provided they have enough time to work."

I feel that college students who do part-time jobs can become more confident, independent, and responsible. College students who interact and deal with adults learn, through experience, how to behave appropriately in public. Moreover, working for a small sum of money teaches college students the value of hard-earned money. Children who solely depend on their parents for their financial needs quite naturally take the money that they are given for granted. They may also tend to spend their money on useless things. In addition to getting the extra money, they can prepare their future career. College students also do part-time jobs to get some experience for future jobs. This experience will be very useful when they come to working in the real world, because they can get some experience that will relate to their next job. Finally, the transition between the studying and the working worlds is great. Many find it difficult initially to adjust to the working world after schooling. College students who have worked part-time will be more comfortable with the transition."

Getting experience is important, because experience is good for us. With much experience in our life, we can easily face problems in our life. For example, if we often perform in front of many people with different cultures, we can reduce our nerves and get more knowledge. Getting training for time management is also important; with having a part-time job, we can think a lot, and it will be make us more disciplined. We must think about when we must study as a college student, and we must keep good time as a worker. So, we must balance between being a student and worker. It will not become a problem if they work together. Before choosing a job, we must combine our schedule first to avoid decreasing our achievement. Having a job is mature, because we can increase our confidence and use our brain before doing something. And we always have to think about our responsibility in every aspect because in the workplace, we are required to do that to avoid making mistakes. Having a part-time job is important for college students because we can learn good time management and we can become successful people.

Some students who have many necessary payments on campus need to look for money by themselves, so they usually work at a cafe, do car washing, work as a newspaper agent, or work at an Internet rental shop. But sometimes, they have problems dividing their time, and they sometimes ignore their assignments from college. But, they feel proud they can complete part of their costs of college without asking their parents. If all students do this, surely all parents would feel proud but they must not complete all of the necessary things. Thus, if sometimes the parents' income is not enough to pay the campus costs, we have to get money by ourselves to cover everything from books to the boarding house without asking our parents.

With the salary, you can learn to be independent, you can save your money, and you can help your parents, and it indirectly makes your parents proud of you. Second, with part-time work, the students learn about real jobs. It advances your skills. Many on-campus part-time jobs will give students the opportunity to learn administrative skills, such as phone and email etiquette, office electronics troubleshooting, and meeting manners. Gaining such skills while in school will place a student-employee ahead of the curve when they enter the full-time workforce. And then, experiencing workplace culture classroom learning is important, but the culture of workplaces and offices are hard to impart within the classroom. Holding down a regular position outside the classroom will allow students to gain firsthand experience of office culture and politics, which will be helpful upon graduation and in their first full-time job. The last reason is that part-time work requires you to balance your time. If you have leisure time you can get a job after you have studied. However, if you can't manage your time, you should not get a part-time job because it can decrease your academic scores."

It can exceed one million rupiahs depending on what kind of part-time job you have. I say it is important, because college students can get more experience before they enter the real world of business. College students can feel how hard it is to make money, so they become more mature naturally. Part-time work can increase students' skills if the part-time job they take is in the same field as their major. They can also improve their skills for managing time. If they take a part-time job, the students should arrange their part-time schedule with their college schedule. So, it will develop the college student's discipline.

Going out from the effect of smoking, smoking in restaurants (and public areas) will disturb many people who don't smoke, who we call “passive smokers.” It is very impolite to smoke around those people, because sometimes there are people who dislike smoking very much. Those people will feel uncomfortable if there is a person smoking beside them. And it also causes the passive smoke to get the side-effects of smoking, so that problem has to be reduced. Moreover, many restaurants have air conditioners (AC) in their rooms. If there is smoke from cigarettes in the AC, it will damage the operation of AC because it needs a clean condition without any dust or smoke.

It is the solution for people who don't like smoking. As we know, visitors of all ages, from young to old, go to restaurants. Smokers must know about that, but they make the restaurant dirty. So, restaurants must give a special place for smokers, if they want to smoke. It is a better solution for the smokers and for the visitors who don't like smoking in restaurants. If the smoker fails to obey that regulation, the restaurant can give them a punishment. Maybe that smoker will have to clean the plates and glasses, or clean the restaurant floor.

They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers and non-smokers, before the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do. In my opinion, many smokers do not smell the smoke of others when they are in public places. Many years ago, people were allowed to smoke everywhere. As a result, an entire generation of elderly experienced lung, throat, mouth, and stomach cancers that were never experienced in history before cigarettes became popular. But now, I believe that each individual has the right to make choices which affect only them. So, I choose to visit restaurants that are smoke-free because there are many disadvantages of smoking.

However, the government must be careful with restaurants and smoking areas because people in Indonesia could become sick. And the price of cigarettes must be increased because it could reduce the number of smokers in Indonesia. Smoking does not have many positives for people and the country. A country without smokers can be a beautiful country because there is no pollution and the people can be healthy. I want Indonesia to be free from pollution because in Indonesia there is a lot of pollution, for example, from motorcycles, cars, and cigarette smoke.

If there are many people using cigarettes in general places, it contributes to the bad things such as air pollution and dirty situation.

People want to go to a restaurant to enjoy the food. So, it is a good rule that smoking should be banned in the restaurants to give a good service to the customers."

All doctors in the world say that smoking is not good for active smokers and it is even worse for passive smokers. Some of us wonder how that can be. The answer is that when the cigarette burns and the active smokers begin to smoke, they breathe clouds of smoke from their noses and mouths. The clouds are inhaled by passive smokers, but the clouds come from the lungs of active smokers and the passive smokers do not know about the active smokers' health. Nowadays, the government has built smoking areas in public places, for example, at department stores, airports, and hotels. The government did so because they hope that the active smokers will not disturb the passive smokers, the health of babies, and the woman who are pregnant. To be honest, the government would be confused if they forbade cigarettes because almost all the employees in this country work at cigarette companies. If they close or stop all the activities of the cigarette companies, they have to think carefully about its effects. The truth is that cigarettes are not good for active smokers and their environment, especially people around them. We hope that the active smokers can reduce or maybe even stop their hobby of smoking. Our health is very expensive, so we have to keep our health."

Smoking inside a room is very dangerous for passive smokers. Usually, passive smokers have to cover their noses or leave the room as fast as possible. But, in some places like a restaurant, we can't get out when there are people smoking near us. We usually eat in a restaurant for a long time. If people near us are smoking, it spreads the smoke to many people. Smoke that is produced from cigarettes is very dangerous for our health. If we inhale it over a long period, we could get serious health problems. People should think about others. They shouldn't smoke in front of others because it could give both active smokers and passive smokers many diseases. It can cause cancer and many other health problems. If they can't stop smoking in front others, I think restaurants should ban smoking for the sake of all people. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country so that people who eat in the restaurants can eat calmly."

We don't realize when we smoke that the smoke is very dangerous to other people because the smoke contains dangerous chemicals that are bad for our health. Although it is a long-term effect, the government should ban it. Nowadays, all smokers are smoking everywhere, even in restaurants. We know that restaurants are the place for enjoying a meal or drink. It is not a place for smoking. It can disturb other people when they are enjoying a meal and enjoying a drink after smoking a cigarette. The people will leave rubbish from their cigarette. Let's imagine that many active smokers smoke in the restaurant, how many people will suffer from a disease. Although it's just a small area, it can bring many risks to our health, environment, and economy. The restaurants usually have a smoking area, so hopefully all customers can smoke in that room. In reality, it is useless because people lack awareness. The conclusion is that the government should ban smoking in restaurants, because it will affect not only society but also people's level of comfort."

Actually, they don't want to disturb people around them with smoking, but it has already become habit to smoke at any time. I hope that active smokers can stop their habit of smoking freely without caring about other people around them in order not to disturb other people. I think all restaurants in the country should suggest to people who visit there not to smoke in the restaurant. Restaurants can put up a warning sign saying not to smoke because it can disturb other people. Smoke from cigarettes can make the restaurant environment very bad and can cause health disturbances, including cancer. So, people must be careful when doing activities near smokers. Restaurants can prepare a special room for smokers to smoke so not to disturb other people, and they can smoke freely there without a warning from other people."

They believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many reasons are considered for banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country and public zones in general. The first reason is human rights. People believe that smoking in public zones is a human rights problem. Smoking in public zones can make nonsmokers become passive smokers, which is very dangerous for their health. There are facts that passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. So, people believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. The other reason is health problem. As explained before, passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking because dangerous materials, which are inhaled by passive smokers are complex. So that passive smokers get more health risks. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In conclusion, for several reasons, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. The government should make a law related to the problem."

Besides that, cigarette smoke also makes others breathe in secondhand smoke which contains chemicals that can damage human health. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous than cigarette smoke breathed in by active smokers. The concentration of nicotine for passive smokers is greater because the poison is sucked through the cigarette smoke of active smokers, which is not filtered. So that makes the passive smokers die of chemical substances that exist in cigarette smoke, which have been inhaled by humans and cannot be processed in the body. Cigarette smoke can cause heart disease, stroke, and so forth. Therefore, we recommend that active smokers reduce their smoking because cigarettes are very harmful for passive smokers who get affected by the cigarette. Smokers should become aware of how their actions harm others. It is better to fine every person who smokes in restaurants because it can interfere with every visitor who was eating at that place."

The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smokers than for active smokers, because the smoke that is aspirated by the active smoker is not good for our health.

Because not all people, especially woman, like to smoke, they almost don't like smokers because smoking can disturb other people. You know why I say that smoking is a big problem in Indonesia? Because almost all of Indonesia's income is from smoking. Therefore, if the cigarette companies close down, there are many people who will lose their job and won't be able to pay for their lives. However, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Why do I agree with that opinion? Because first, if we smoke, we have to spend our money buying cigarettes every day. Second, if we smoke in the restaurants, we will disturb other people who are eating there. Because the vapor of smoke can make our breath smell, especially for woman. While people will not forbid those who want to smoke, they also know which places to smoke.

And you can get some diseases such as cancer that reduce the length and quality of your life.

Secondhand (passive smoker) smoke is more dangerous than filtered smoke so it is detrimental to people around smokers.

Firstly, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because the restaurants have AC, so this annoys people who come into the restaurants with their family such as children or an elderly father. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants makes the restaurants smell. Commonly in the restaurants, there is a different place for the smoking and no smoking areas so that nonsmokers will be comfortable in the restaurants. Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants is not good for our health. If customers are eating in the restaurants and they become unhealthy, of course this is a serious problem and needs to be quickly solved. If a young people man gets lung disease, the smell of a cigarette can worsen his disease, and the young man could die. This is a very serious problem.

We buy cigarettes every day to burn into ash, but actually what we burn is our money; that is terrible that we buy something that can hurt ourselves with, especially our health. In other cases, cigarettes are poison. Everybody knows that, but they cannot leave the cigarette because the poison is in the cigarette itself. If someone smokes it once, he will try again, and again, and again. He was poisoned with the cigarette, and in the period, the cigarette was the primary tool. If we ask ten men, eight from them will say “I am a smoker.” This is the proof that cigarettes are poisoning almost all men in the world. If we don't smoke, we are passive smokers, we must warn smokers to change their smoking habits. If they can't stop smoking, we should tell them to be understanding of us as passive smokers so that they only smoke in private areas not in public areas, such as restaurants."

The smoke of the cigarettes will pollute the environment and endanger the not only the smokers but also the people who do not smoke. Some people, especially ladies, cannot stand the smoke of cigarettes and the smoke will certainly harm them. They may not enjoy their meal or they may even have difficulty breathing. Also, cigarettes are bad for our health, especially secondhand smoke. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in the close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as coughs, bronchitis, asthma, and carcinoma of the lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking.

Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants, where people need comfort and nutrition for the body. When there are people smoking, the comfort is reduced and people could risk many potential illnesses. It is not possible for restaurants to make rules that ban smoking because they do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted to smoking so that customers who do not smoke will not feel uncomfortable in restaurants and customers who are comfortable with billowing smoke have special rooms.

Research says that passive smokers are 80% more likely to suffer from cancer than active smokers. After knowing that fact, people start to think about how to overcome this kind of problem. For example, shopping centers usually provide smoking areas for smokers. Hospitals strictly forbid smoking inside the hospital because it can create an unsuitable environment and cause more bacteria and viruses. Next, I will talk about smoking in restaurants. I will divide the restaurants into three levels: small-scale, mid-scale, and large-scale restaurants. Small-scale restaurants usually allow customers to smoke inside the restaurant. They don't separate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Mid-scale restaurants such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds sometimes provide a smoking area for customers. For example, they provide outdoor seats for customers who smoke. In this scale, usually after the customers enter the restaurant, they will be asked whether they smoke or not and they will be directed to the smoking area if they smoke. Large-scale restaurants usually already forbid people from smoking. They don't have smoking areas to prevent disturbance to other customers."

Not to mention that a cigarette contains some substances that are addictive. Maybe it is as addictive as a drug because it makes people want more. Some restaurants in this country still allow customers to smoke. I think that is not a good way to develop a restaurant because their smoke can be very annoying, and it could also change the taste of food from that restaurant. It is true that some restaurants provide a special room for those who smoke, but that alone won't really help to ban people from smoking. That will only give them a special privilege, or something like a special room for them. A way to stop them is to not give smokers an option at all, a no smoking area. If only every restaurant wanted to applied this, but sadly they don't, and that is why smokers still exist in restaurants."

One effect of being a passive smoker is lung cancer. So, to protect other non-smoking people, the government sets a rule that prohibits smokers from smoking in public spaces, such as at malls and universities. According to the rule, malls and other public spaces have to provide some places where the smoker can smoke. At restaurants, there are places that are assigned as smoking areas. Although the area is separated, the smoke can still affect people who don't smoke. This is because there is no glass separating the smoking area from the no smoking area, so we can still inhale the smoke. Let's look at an example, when the restaurant is full and the waitress places someone who smokes near our table, it will annoy us because of the smoke.

As we know, smoking is an activity that gives no benefits and wastes our money. Smoking also makes people sick and causes serious diseases, not only for the smokers, but also the people who breathe in the smoke of their cigarettes. Smoking in the restaurant is also not polite because a restaurant is a place for eating. It will harm others. In the world, every year we can find 2.2 million human deaths because of lung disease. The disease is coming from many years of smoking. Cigarettes contain nicotine. If you think that nicotine is the only dangerous chemical in cigarettes, you are wrong! Nicotine can be absorbed into the blood. It makes a smoker feel relaxed because it is a neurotransmitter. It also makes a heartbeat, blood pressure, and adrenaline feel better. This makes a smoker want to smoke again. Cigarettes are made of tobacco, which is dangerous because it causes lung disease, heart disease, emphysema, and the other diseases. Some other dangerous materials in cigarettes include cyanide, benzene, cadmium, ammonia, and naphthalene. In all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned because it disturbs other people."

Restaurants are places where people eat or gather, so there are people and food. So, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because the air will be bad and full of pollution from the cigarettes. And the passive smoker will get harmed. And the food will also become toxic because it is infected by the air. So, if we eat the food, it will make our body sick because the quality of the food is not good anymore. Also, the smoker will make people around them become passive smokers, and they will make their family sick. Smokers do not understand that when they are smoking, it is the same as if they are burning their money, and smoking will decrease their time in the world. One cigarette equates to one hour.

Almost all young people smoke every day, in fact every hour. Almost all of them use the cigarette as a friend when they are quiet, in restaurants, sometimes in public facilities, at bus stops, and at the market, etc. In restaurants, almost all people smoke when they are waiting for someone. All of the country should be banned from smoking, but most people ignore it, even though they know the effects of smoking. Restaurants in Indonesia have no area for smokers, so people smoke everywhere. There are many cases of death from the serious effects of smoking, but many people ignore it.

Restaurants are public facilities where there are so many people who are not smokers. Many people take their children because restaurants are places for people to get together. So directly or indirectly, smoking can influence the comfort of visitors. We know there are so many bad effects of smoking. First, the biggest effect is disturbing the breathing and the lungs, and causing lung cancer. This is one reason why smoking is not allowed in restaurants. But I think, this rule is not only for restaurants, but also other public facilities, such as the market, mosque, church, bus stop, and railway station. One solution is that the owners of restaurants provide a special place for smokers. But sometimes, this rule is not followed by some people, they are lazy about going to the smoking area.

Passive smokers indirectly smell the smoke from the cigarette of the active smoker. The smoke is the poison, so the passive smoker is breathing in the poison from the cigarette of the active smoker. In many restaurants, there will be many children. If the restaurant is free of smokers, the children will smell the smoke from the cigarette. The food that has been served will automatically be poisoned because of the cigarette smoke, so the food will not be healthy. There is a solution if restaurant owners do not want to ban smoking from the restaurant, they must have a smoking area. A smoking area is a place for smoking. It is a closed room away from the main room, so the smoker can smoke freely in that room."

The most popular part-time jobs are waiting tables in restaurants and junior technical support positions in computer shops. Some students apply for freelance jobs, which require advanced skill sets, such as taking photographs or writing computer programs. Without doubt, part-time jobs can be an opportunity for students to earn money. Some students from families with poor financial situations have to work after having lessons to support the family. Other benefits of applying for part-time jobs include making new friends at work to enlarge the student’s social network, learning to work with others, which students may not have done before, and learning new skills that may not be included in the university course syllabus. Of course, there are also cons for applying for part-time jobs. Without good time management, students may not be able to balance the time and effort they put into their studies and their part-time jobs, and this can have a huge effect on their grades. Choosing an appropriate type of part-time job is important too; otherwise, students might fall into traps setup by fraudulent companies. In conclusion, although university students have a good opportunity to apply for part-time jobs, their studies are most important; therefore, students should plan well before applying for any jobs."

Whether it is important for a university student to get a part-time job depends on what he or she wants to get from it. University students are already adults. They should have the ability to determine the importance of having a part-time job. For me, it is important because I would like to get more work experience during my university life to prepare me for adapting to society after I graduate university. However, I will always put my studies before my part-time jobs since the main purpose for me to be a university student is to receive further education in my major and achieve all-round development.

In my opinion, it is not important for university students to have a part-time job because it is less important than getting a good academic result and joining in different school activities. There are three main reasons for my opinion. First, as university is already the last three years of studying in the whole of our lives, we should study well while joining in different school activities. It is time-consuming for us to have a part-time job. Second, work experiences can be obtained after we have finished our university studies. There is much time left after the end of our studies. Third, it is not necessary to get a part-time job. Between scholarships and support from our parents, students should have enough cash to live on without having a part-time job to earn extra money. In conclusion, I think that we should treasure the remaining time we have of our studies and enjoy the chances we have to make new friends. Therefore, I disagree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job."

Street-smart people know how to deal with daily problems. To achieve this trait, it is important for university students to have a part-time job, because they will learn how to manage their time by having a part-time job. They will also get an opportunity to work as a team player. Students will also learn about time management by having a part-time job. However, it is hard for some people to use their time wisely. Thus, students will learn how to divide their time equally between study and work by having a part-time job. They will also be more responsible at completing assigned tasks within a given time. A good part-time job enables students to work as part of a team. Companies are looking for team players because a team player is able to complete his tasks better than a person who works alone. A person who works in solitude will only be able to make the best decision by comparing his viewpoint with his colleagues’ points of view. This is the reason why companies are looking for team players nowadays. Therefore, it is necessary for university students to have a part-time job in order to be street smart."

They earn money for their daily lives and learn to become financially independent, and they can experience the real society before graduating. It is a rare opportunity for them to build up their networks, which will benefit them a lot in the future. Moreover, it is easier for them to set targets after obtaining work experience. On the other hand, students can benefit the society because people with higher education levels work in positions with higher salaries. Thus, while they are still undergraduates, they can work in the positions at smaller companies that cannot afford to employ educated elites. Not only are students well educated, but they also have more creativity than adults who have worked for many years. Additionally, students have the chance to practice their creativity and critical thinking. Overall, based on the points mentioned above, it is worthwhile and important for university students to have a part-time job."

The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills."

Some people argue that students should focus on their studies at university and not have a part-time job. They say that doing a part-time job would make them focus less on the lessons and spend less time doing homework and revision. However, from my point my view, it is important for university students to have a part-time job. Firstly, part-time jobs help university students to enter the society. After their studies at university, students will need to start to working in the society. Doing part-time jobs can help students to gain work experience and learn some specific abilities that will be useful in finding a job after their graduation. In addition, part-time jobs help university students to earn a living. University students usually need to stay in halls due to the distance between their home and university. The daily meal and hall fees are a heavy burden for them. It is therefore a good idea for them to have a part-time job to lighten the burden. They can also become independent by earning money for themselves instead of asking their parents for money. To sum up, doing part-time jobs has more advantages than disadvantages for university students. Therefore, university students should have a part-time job."

In my opinion, students should put their studies first because studying is the main responsibility of being a student. Students should be able to cope with their studies before making any other decisions. If they are unable to handle their studies, how will they be able to manage their time well? Another reason is the time consumed by a part-time job. I think this aspect relates to the types of part-time job. I had a classmate who had a part-time job at a pharmaceutical company. He usually worked for three to four full days a week, which I think is unacceptable. Therefore, I think it is less important for university students to have a part-time job while they are studying. However, some people might suggest that having a part-time job is important because some people need to earn their living. Some might also argue that it would be good opportunity to gain experience before working in the society because some companies require previous experience.

Part-time jobs offer an all-round education for students because they can develop their interpersonal skills, which cannot be learned from books. In addition, communicating with their counterparts or boss is important for their mental growth because students are very sensitive. They have received an education since they were young, so it is high time they applied their knowledge to a working environment. They can earn more money for their daily expenditure as the school fees and living costs are very high at universities. They may not need to receive grant loans from the government, and they can become financially independent, which can reduce the burden on their families and the government.

First, the things that can be learned from a part-time job can be also learned from many other places. Many students claim that a part-time job can help them to improve their communication and leadership skills. That is the major reason why people think finding a part-time job is important. However, we can also achieve this aim in other ways such as being a committee member of societies. In the other words, finding a part-time job is not the only way to achieve this goal. Second, the work experience gained from a part-time job is not as useful as what most people claim. Since the part-time job is probably not related to the student’s future career, the work experience is not counted when they want to find a job in the future. To conclude, owing to the above reasons, I do not think finding a part-time job is very important."

University students can have a part-time job in their spare time, for instance, working as a part-time tutor. Thus, students have extra money to resolve their financial problems and reduce the financial pressure on their families. Therefore, having a part-time job is essential for university students. Moreover, a part-time job provides work experience for university students. It is difficult for university students to get a job after graduating without any working experience.

Thus, it is vital for us to check the background of the target companies in terms of what they do and how the wages are paid. We must get these safety precautions done before we find a job, which is also something we should be careful of in the future.

Students could learn specific skills by training for different types of jobs, so they might have experiences of being a tutor, a teacher, a waiter, or a salesperson. Most experiences can help in future occupations, but it is important that the job relate to your studies or plans. However, many people claim that part-time jobs are time-consuming, and students at different stages of their studies should put their academic work first. From my viewpoint, university students should have good time management; if not, a part-time job is a good chance for them to learn. In addition, nowadays, we are concerned about multi-competencies, which is why we have to study at university. As having a part-time job is a fantastic way to earn money, it should be recommended."

Tutoring is one of the popular jobs that they often choose. However, why are so many students spending their time doing a part-time job rather than using the time to study? What is the importance of doing a part-time job? Experience is one of the benefits university students want to gain by doing a part-time job. In today's society, work experience is required, and for a fresh graduate of a university, part-time jobs are the only method to gain experience. Money is also one of the reasons that students get a part-time job. In Hong Kong, the university school fees are around 42,000 Hong Kong dollars per year. Even though the government has already paid much of it for us, it is still a large amount of money for a normal family. Besides, students have to spend the money on things such as meals and transport. If students have a part-time job, it can lighten the financial pressure on their families. Some people are against this statement since they think the students’ academic results might be affected a part-time job. It is a shame because the time available for revision must decrease. However, it also provides a chance for students to practice their time management skills. If the students manage their time in an intelligent way, it will be easy to ensure a good academic result. No pain, no gain. In this case, what we need to do is use the least pain for the maximum gain. A part-time job for university students is a good example of it. Therefore, I agree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job."

Apart from joining sports teams and student societies, having a part-time job is certainly among the top choices. The importance of a part-time job is recognized by a great number of people, including me. Most students go to university to prepare themselves to blend into the society in the future. Being successful in the society calls for skills of working and cooperating, which can be developed by working at part-time jobs. For instance, one can learn how to set the working agenda and get help from colleagues. Without these skills, even if the student gets a good occupation upon his graduation, they will possibly feel it difficult to get used to the job, and thus their performance will be unsatisfactory. Another advantage of having a part-time job is that it offers some money, which the student can use to make their life more colorful. Such advantage is embodied by the experience of my friend Bill. He likes traveling very much but he lacked the money to do it often. He overcame that limitation by finding a part-time job. With his salary, he has managed to travel to many places including Singapore and Tokyo. Of course, the salary could also be used to purchase a piano or football according to the student’s interest. In conclusion, having a part-time job brings a large number of benefits. Though it might be a bit difficult to find a satisfactory job, the outcome of part-time jobs is worth all the effort."

Besides celebrating their independence from their family, it also means that students will possibly be responsible for their own financial situation. For different reasons, many students apply for part-time jobs. Some want to gain work experience, some want to earn money for luxuries, and some need money to reduce the financial pressure on their families. It is fair to say that their reasons are understandable. However, no matter how fancy their reasons, having a part-time job could affect their studies due to having a packed schedule and experiencing disturbances in their studies. University students should equip themselves to face the upcoming challenges when they graduate. Some part-time jobs actually help students learn many things and help them to prepare for their future careers. However, some only give students a salary and nothing else. I sometimes ask the students what they really expected from their job. I disagree that they should only do a part-time job for money, and I encourage them to prepare themselves for future challenges."

Many of them work the appropriate number of hours for their part-time job and find the balance to maintain their studies. There are several reasons why it is important for university students to have a part-time job. The first reason is that they need more money when they get into university because most university students want to be financially independent, which means they want to have their own source of income. In light of this, many will choose to have a part-time job instead of asking for money from their parents. Having a part-time job, in my opinion, is a precious chance for university students to learn more about the society. Just as many people have said, university is a stepping-stone to the real society. Students can discover much more than what they learned in school, and they can get memorable experiences of working in real industries. Besides, they can get along with other people of different ages, and who have different opinions and life experiences. This can help them to explore more about the society. However, students need to maintain a balance between their work and studies. They need to manage their time and effort for their work and studies carefully. I think a part-time job is essential for university students."

For university students, the most important task is to gain academic knowledge and learn how to deal with real world situations. Therefore, one should consider whether a specific activity benefits university students according to these two criteria. Certainly, some will argue that a part-time job equips students with the experience to handle problems occurring in the society. However, a part-time job is not the most efficient way, and it dramatically shrinks the time students can devote to their academic studies. Most families in Hong Kong can afford to cover the tuition fees to finish university, so most students do not carry a heavy financial burden, and thus it is not necessary for students to earn money by getting a part-time. Nevertheless, students could choose to take part in an internship provided by the university in order to approach the world outside university. Compared with a part-time job, an internship could be better designed in terms of improving personal leadership, communication, and cooperative skills. Thus, university students are recommended to reduce their time involved in part-time jobs."

If the living standard of a student’s family is not sufficient to cope with the basic needs, the student might need to find a part-time job to supplement the family income, as the university tuition fees in Hong Kong may still be unaffordable for some families, even with subsidies from the government. However, because the money is not the greatest concern for students from ordinary families, I would say that the students should reserve more time to enjoy their university life. They could make use of their free time to join more activities and make more friends to expand their social circle, while developing their interpersonal skills at the same time. They could try organizing different things such as an event or an orientation camp for other students to accumulate leadership experience, which would be useful for their growth. After all, most students will start work after their graduation, where there will be many chances for them to work, so they do not need to start working too early. Although some may argue that internship experience is important for their first job after graduating, I argue that employers look more closely at your interpersonal and communication skills than the so-called minor work experiences when you are finding your first job. Overall, university students should enjoy their life and accumulate more experiences before starting work."

However, those smokers always ignore the fact that the nasty smell of the smoke and the toxic substances released from the cigarettes are harmful to others. No matter what smokers argue, people around smokers are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke, which shows how selfish those smokers are. Reports from different medical research has already found that the smoke and toxic substances from cigarettes cause cancer, including lung cancer. Even if smokers are not concerned about the potential danger of having cancer, they should not ignore the rights of others who want to avoid those substances. Smoking in the kitchen can be even more dangerous. When people smoke, cigarette ash may drop onto the food being prepared, which is very harmful to our health. Secondly, without enough care, lighted cigarettes may cause a fire in the kitchen, which is a serious threat to customers in the restaurant. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because of the health issues it may cause."

Based on this purpose, it is reasonable to completely ban smoking at all restaurants, including pubs. From the viewpoint of smokers, the ban will restrict them from smoking whenever or wherever they want. They will only be allowed to smoke in their homes. The inconvenience brought by the policy will probably force them to give up smoking. This method is surely much more efficient than just persuading them via TV advertisements. Additionally, passive smoking causes a large amount of deaths worldwide every year and has an especially bad effect on children's development. Aside from health problems, studies have found that passive smoking also harms the intelligence of children. The more children are exposed to passive smoking, the higher the chance of having poor intelligence. Completely banning smoking in all restaurants can reduce the chance of people being exposed to passive smoking. In addition, it is important to maintain a consistent policy. It is not fair for the government to ban only some kinds of restaurants but not all."

In my opinion, although smoking is one’s right, non-smokers who are sitting in the same restaurant should by no means be forced to inhale any of the smoke. Therefore, smoking should immediately be banned at all restaurants in our city. As we all know, smoking leads to severe illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. In addition, when one smokes, the air around is inevitably contaminated with harmful smoke. Therefore, nearby customers have to breathe in the smokers’ smoke. Let us consider for a moment if we had three meals  a day at restaurants and spent 30 minutes eating each meal how much smoke we would we breathe in and how our health would be affected. The only result is that our health would deteriorate. What is more, the deterioration of our health would increase the workload of public hospitals and lead to a higher death rate. Under no circumstances should the public’s health be sacrificed for the selfish behavior of smokers. Therefore, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants."

Unfortunately, it is not only the active smokers but also the passive smokers who receive the negative effects of smoking. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Both active and passive smokers share the same deathly risks, including stroke, heart disease, brain damage, and cancer. These passive smokers would be saved from these deadly issues if people were not allowed to smoke in restaurants. Inhaling the smoke can disrupt the human respiratory system, and smokers give bad impressions. Their teeth are stained, their gums are rotted, and they give off unpleasant odors. These conditions are uncomfortable for non-smokers. As an example, a non-smoker like me would prefer to eat in the non-smoking section of a restaurant because the non-smoking sections are usually cleaner than the smoking sections. The smoking section contains smokers and tobaccos ash, which would cause me discomfort. It would be better to ban smoking completely at all restaurants rather than increase the number of smoking and non-smoking sections.

Sometimes, for convenience, some smokers just throw their cigarette ends on the floor inside restaurants. I do not think anybody likes to have meal in such dirty restaurants. Hence, the income of the restaurant is likely affected. Nowadays, more people are concerned about the issue of banning smoking because they are alerted to the hazards of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is as harmful as firsthand smoke. During an hour’s meal, the smoke irritates our respirational system, and because of the smoke, non-smokers have a greater chance of suffering from deadly diseases such as lung cancer.

Convincing me that smoking in restaurants is acceptable on any level at all is like convincing a blind man to buy a 3D HDTV; it simply does not compute.

It is your lungs breathing the smoke, your money paying for it, and your brain deciding that this somehow makes sense. You, however, are not going to smoke within any reasonable radius of the untainted pink lungs that belong to me. A restaurant is a public place. A smoker loses the right to do what he pleases when his actions infringe upon others and their ability to do what they please. Banning smoking is not a way of infringing on your rights, it is a way of making sure you do not infringe on mine. Aside from that, this is eating we are speaking of! Food is a beautiful mix of sights and smells, a confluence of aromatic explosions. Dining is an experience, and the culinary arts are the pinnacle of human achievement. A good meal is the work of an artist. Any chef worth his weight in salt (or soy sauce, since we are in Hong Kong) will shriek in horror if it is known that the splendid scent of tobacco is going to infuse itself into his work of art.

To begin with, smoking in the restaurant affects other customers. Non-smoking customers are supposed to have a comfortable environment for them to enjoy their food and talk with their friends. Smokers in the restaurant will create secondhand smoke and make the environment unpleasant. Furthermore, smokers create a lot of dirt in the restaurants. Some smokers leave their cigarettes and ash on the floor, which affects the cleanliness of the restaurants. The owner of the restaurant will need to take the time to clean it, and this dirty environment could reduce the number of customers. Briefly, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.

Some people may be annoyed by the smoke that is being breathed out, especially in indoor areas, which are less well ventilated. However, some people, including restaurant managers, may argue it should not be banned at all restaurants since it may affect the flow of customers, including smokers, who may choose not to go. In addition, there are some difficulties in defining the areas of the restaurants if the laws are made, such as the seating area outside the restaurant and the outdoor catering area, and another problem may arise in relation to the penalty for violating the laws.

If one person smokes in a restaurant, all the other customers and the waiters will inhale the harmful smoke. Some people suggest building smoking rooms. However, the waiters still have to enter the room to serve the customers. Therefore, it is necessary to ban smoking in all restaurants to prevent harming the citizens. Second, banning smoking can prevent arguments about the definition of “indoors” from occurring. Many arguments about this keep appearing.

First, smoking is an activity that endangers people's health because the major components in the cigarette are tar and nicotine, which are harmful to the human body. At the same time, people who do not smoke absorb the secondhand smoke from the smokers while they are having meals in the restaurant. The results of inhaling the secondhand smoke are as serious as smoking, and the chemicals inside the cigarette can cause many diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. The consequences of those diseases can be fatal. Therefore, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants in order to prevent fatal diseases. Furthermore, restaurants are public places that everyone can enter. If secondhand smoke is present inside the restaurant, all of the people inside the restaurant are forced to inhale the harmful smoke, thus putting people’s health in danger.

Non-smokers are innocent, and they should not be subjected to secondhand smoke, because they have the right to choose not to suffer from the fatal diseases; some are even allergic to the particulates. Considering the space of restaurants, the ventilation system is usually not good enough to get rid of all those particulates or main ingredients in cigarettes, so these substances are free to flow around, and others are forced to inhale the evil gas.

One common toxic ingredient is nicotine, which causes smokers to become addicted to the cigarettes. Once people intake nicotine, they will find it very hard to stop smoking. Cigarettes also contain ammonia, which scientists have discovered will let you absorb more nicotine. Another ingredient in cigarettes is tar, which is a chemical that causes cancer. According to research, smokers are ten times more likely to get lung cancer than are non-smokers, and they are three times more likely to have a stroke. Allowing smoking in restaurants can cause health problems to both the smokers and the passive smokers. From the viewpoint of business, tourism is one of the most important economic factors in Hong Kong. If smoking is prohibited in all restaurants, non-smoking tourists will be more likely to spend more time and money enjoying the clean environment in the restaurants. To conclude, banning smoking in all restaurants can cause less people to suffer from health problems and enhance the economy in the restaurants in Hong Kong. Therefore, smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants in Hong Kong."

Smoking is definitely harmful to our health, whether smokers or non-smokers. As we know, a cigarette contains over 20 carcinogenic compounds, and the smoke that a smoker and non-smoker breathe in is the same. That means non-smokers in restaurants have equal chances of being killed by toxic smoke, which is unfair. Cigarette smoking is expensive. Many smokers pay more than $1000 a month for packages of cigarettes. Besides finances, the diseases that result from smoking increase the financial burden of health care units, as more and more money has to put into the budget for treatments such as chemotherapy. If the smoking ban is not proposed, the probability of people in contact with toxic gases will increase and a higher budget would be needed. Of course, smoke smells, and it not only pollutes the environment, but also reduces our appetites. The nasty smell often causes nausea and affects the appearance of food. Another point is that the smell of smoke also comes from smokers, which is disgusting. There are so many reasons to support the ban of smoking in restaurants. Public areas such as bus stops and shopping malls have already assigned a smoking ban, so why should it not also be done in restaurants."

However, there are still many citizens in Hong Kong that smoke. The government has done many things to get the public to stop smoking. One method that the government has done recently is to completely ban smoking at all restaurants. The supporters of this policy are mainly the people that did not smoke. Research has shown that secondhand smoke is harmful for humans. Even if you are not a smoker, if someone smokes near you, it also decreases your life. It is expected that non-smokers would not to want to sit near a smoking person. Therefore, this policy has been a great help to prevent the above situation. Of course, the smokers disagreed with this policy because they think that they have the right to smoke anywhere they want. Moreover, there are parties against this policy such as the restaurant owners, who are afraid that it will affect their income if they stop people smoking. I agree with the government’s policy. We cannot let the health of most people be affected by a few people’s money and freedom. This policy will also decrease the amount of smokers. For the above reason, it is the right decision to set this policy."

Smokers claim that they can give an infinite list of advantages of smoking such as its ability to provide people with focus. The protestors, on the contrary, strongly require that smoking be completely banned at public places such as restaurants. They argue that smoking severely harms human health. From my perspective, the latter opinion is more favorable, especially when referring to restaurants. First, allowing smoking will reduce the number of customers that come to the restaurant. When choosing which restaurant to go to, the customers value hygiene. Since smoking causes harm not only to the smoker himself but also to the people around them, it can drive away a considerable number of customers. In addition, forbidding smoking in all restaurants can help many smokers to stop smoking. Most people fail to quit smoking because smoking is inevitable when having parties in restaurants, and because on such occasions, people always try to persuade others to smoke. These people hate smoking but they have to suffer from it against their will. Thus, if smoking is banned in all restaurants, many people who used to yield to others’ persuasion can be relieved from smoking. Briefly, smoking does far more harm than good to all people in the long term, so disallowing smoking in all restaurants is beneficial to all customers. Now that giving up smoking is one of the ultimate goals of the society, starting with restaurants is surely a wise choice due to the reasons stated above."

In addition, due to criticism from activists, Hong Kong’s government can hardly legislate prohibiting smoking in Hong Kong, because it is also against people’s human rights. Smokers claim that they have the right and freedom to smoke. To avoid the term “freedom” from being abused, it is necessary to define what freedom means. Freedom, by dictionary definition, is the state of being free. However, does it really mean there is no limit or restriction? Freedom of one should be based on ensuring that it has no effect on others, i.e., smokers should consider whether there is anyone nearby who does not want to passively smoke. I hate smoking and cigarettes, but I do not agree that smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants. However, I think it is better to set up distinct smoking and non-smoking areas in a restaurant. It could be a win-win situation for both smokers and non-smokers."

Thousands of lung cancer deaths have been caused by smoking and breathing in secondhand smoke. As a non-smoker, I cannot agree more with banning smoking at all restaurants. Secondhand smoke can cause many innocent people to die. Many cases show that not only the smoker, but also the secondhand smoker suffers from different kinds of diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease. Therefore, the restaurants, where we go often, should ban smoking to prevent innocent people from breathing in harmful smoke. Banning smoking at all restaurants can show the support of the local government for a non-smoking environment and the health of its citizens. People will be more aware about the harmfulness of smoking if the government bans smoking and promotes a non-smoking life. The most important thing is that restaurants are places for people to gather with families and friends. How can you enjoy a dinner when you are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke? It cannot help even if the restaurant has divided its area into smoking and non-smoking areas. The smoke can still circulate in the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants to provide citizens with a comfortable place for dining. Last, smoking is not good for anyone. We should all support a non-smoking environment and pursue a healthy life."

It is universally accepted that smoking can lead to severe damage to the respiratory system of smokers and even to people who just smell the smoke. Restaurants are usually crowded with people so that it is not practical to separate smokers from non-smoking customers. Nor is it possible to prevent the diffusion of the cancer-causing smoke. Therefore, it is a public health issue to impose laws to ban smoking in restaurants. Moreover, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that everyone has the right to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. One might argue that smokers should also have their freedom to decide when and where to smoke. However, when they smoke in public, others are deprived of the freedom to choose their dining environment. They are forced to intake the smoke while they are eating. Smoking in public is just like any other form of crime that satisfies one's needs while sacrificing others’ legitimate rights."

Many smokers would assert that smoking in restaurants is their private business, and as long as it is legal, they have the right to do it. Nevertheless, this seemingly strong argument is far from being valid because they intentionally omit the prerequisite of freedom: their actions cannot intrude into others’ freedom. Non-smokers, who also have the right to not inhale the stale cigarette smoke given out by smokers, may feel uncomfortable when the air around them is bad. Moreover, passive smoking may affect the health of other customers in restaurants because the cigarette smoke is proved to contain a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals. For this reason, it is necessary to ban smoking in restaurants. In addition, if smoking is allowed in restaurants, some chefs and waiters may smoke in their working environment. In some cases, the smoking residue may fall into the food to be delivered to customers. Contaminated food is not at all hygienic, so when people eat it, they may easily get sick. Thus, for the health of the public and for issues of hygiene, smoking should be banned at all restaurants."

Second, a person who is not short of income but wants to improve his life by getting a car instead of a bike, a house instead of renting, or daily fruits rather than weekly food etc. A part-time job is a hard job and always done with a short timeframe in mind. That is, people always start such jobs with the intention of leaving that job after achieving temporary targets such as the marriage of their daughters or the studies of their children. Most of the time, a part-time job is not done for more than six hours and people are not professional in such jobs. It is common in countries where inflation rates are high or people are showy. They want to meet the self-created, useless standards in the society, and for that purpose, they get such jobs.

A major reason is that they want to make money to earn their living. Currently, the inflation rate is increasing day by day, and it has become impossible even for the head of an upper middle class family to maintain their status and keep their lives going smoothly, so they do part-time jobs. Students also do part-time jobs to help their families, make their own pocket money, or for experience, exposure, and independence. It gives them glimpses of the practical world. Regarding the payment of part-time jobs, it is not very satisfactory. Some mills and organizations pay very fairly.

Releasing stress is one of the main things that a smoker will tell when you ask him about smoking. To put a thing or habit on a good or bad list depends upon its usage. If you smoke because your doctor has advised you that burning one or two cigarettes does not matter, and you are doing it for fun, to look cool, and to release stress, these are just ways to satisfy ourselves.

In any case, smoking is not a good thing. It is a burden on the pocket and health. It is equal to burning your income in the fire. Therefore, it really is a burden on the pocket. On the other hand, it is also a burden on health. It kills smokers slowly and steadily. It directly damages the lungs and chest of the smokers. Passive smoking is equally harmful. Passive smokers also get the harmful effects of the smoking. In this way, it is a dangerous thing. Students also smoke. It is very dangerous for students to smoke. They come to study and fall into bad company, and in this way, they actually destroy their future. In the beginning of their life, they destroy themselves. There should be ban on smoking in colleges and schools."

People start for many reasons. First, they feel they will be relieved from their tensions. Second, they are attracted by the style of people who smoke and so they start smoking, leading to a bad habit. Thirdly, most people start unintentionally due to the environment and become addicted later on when they cannot stop, even intentionally. Smoking is lot more disadvantageous than it is beneficial. It is the cause of many diseases such as lung cancer. Smokers cannot run for long, so they cannot be a good athlete or sportsman. Smokers feel uneasy if they do not get their fix of nicotine at regular intervals. In fact, smoking leads to the addiction of other drugs. It causes complex personality problems. Smoking excessively may lead to a loss of fertility in males and females. A regular smoker, called a “chain smoker,” loses 48 minutes of his life with just one cigarette. A study has shown that people sitting around a smoker, who are even not smoking, are at risk of getting lung cancer before the smoker himself. So not only should one get away from smoking but also restrain one’s friends from smoking to save all in the community. That is why it is prohibited in public places by the government, thankfully. The basic component causing all the harm is nicotine. Can you drink the amount of nicotine in a cigarette in a glass? That is the point, so why do we inhale it? It is all about being aware and practical. This is the reason why it is prohibited according to Islamic rules, and some scholars say its haram because it is a matter of being extravagant with money, losing good health, and polluting the environment."

To use cigarettes or to smoke cigarettes is all the same. Now smoking is not confined to cigarettes only. People fill some highly sedative contents in cigarettes and then smoke them. It might be nicotine or cocaine. People who smoke a lot are called chain smokers. In our country, smoking is more common among men than women. The smoking rate in Pakistan was 1% before the Afghan war. After that, it increased disastrously when refugees came to Pakistan from Afghanistan across the Pak-Afghan border. As far as the harms of smoking are concerned, it is disastrous for health. It can cause cancer and it destroys lungs. It causes breathing problems. Its harm is not only confined to health. When a smoker gets addicted to smoking, he can go to any limits. An addict cannot concentrate on his work. He goes for cigarettes every now and then. His family is affect by it. In the case of financially weak people, smoking can ruin lives. There are several cases when smokers who need money for cigarettes have sold their houses, and ended up selling their houses one by one. However, talking about smoking, very few people know that it has advantages as well. Doctors sometimes recommend it as sedatives for cures. It is only good when it is prescribed. Sometimes drivers smoke while driving to keep themselves awake and fresh. However, an excess of anything is bad. To conclude, drugs are not good for married or unmarried people. One must value the gift of health that Allah has bestowed on us. One must realize one's duties as a person, family member, native of the country, and as a Muslim. One ought to avoid things that are harmful for any of his relations."

Children are the major target of smoking, because when they reach college or university level, they consider themselves free and feel they can do anything they want. Because of this free environment and looking at others surrounding them, they also start smoking. They find pleasure in smoking, and they try to show off their smoking. They smoke at least one or two packets daily just to enjoy, without thinking about the harmful effects. They slowly go off the smoke of cigarettes. Nowadays, a new type of cigarette or smoking has been introduced, which people call shisha; it is a type of hookah but smaller in size, so the new generation feels proud about having it. They go to hotel clubs to smoke it. They can take it to their home or stay at the club and kill themselves by smoking it. Electronic media also play a vital role in spreading this curse. Every day, there are million advertisements of cigarettes, and another reason for so many smokers is that cigarettes are easily available to everyone. Even a child can access them in any shop at any time. The government should create some laws that prohibit the sale of cigarettes to children."

It should be strictly prohibited at restaurants because a smoker is destroying health of not only himself but also all the other people there. Smoking is very harmful whether you smoke or not. It causes bronchitis and affects the capillaries around the lungs. This leads to asthma and breathing problems. Moreover, at restaurants, people have food. When smokers smoke, other people also inhale their smoke and it affects them. Thus, in a way, smokers disturb other people. Therefore, such people should not be allowed to smoke at such public places because they pollute the environment. Smoking has harmful effects, so it should be banned.

Moreover, smoking should be abolished because it not only harms the one carrying out this atrocity but it also pollutes the environment and disturbs the beauty of the nature. Hence, smoking should be banned, keeping in mind its hazards, especially in restaurants. Restaurants are a public place, where people meet and enjoy different foods. A family place like this should not be polluted by smoking. Smoking causes an unusual and bad odor to spread in the whole area, which disturbs other people. Therefore, it can be comprehensively concluded that smoking is an evil that should be eradicated from the society. In addition, not only the society but also the individual should get away from this enemy and purify the society from this evil.

Some smoke only to be fashionable, and others smoking by following their elders; when they see their elders are smoking, they have a desire to taste it. If they smoke by following their desire, they become badly addicted with the passing of time and then it becomes very difficult for them to stop. Smoking has negative effects on health. It not only affects the health of smokers, but it also has negative effects on non-smokers because the fumes of the cigarettes cause many diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, and even eye problems. Smoking badly pollutes the environment. The smoke of cigarettes is very dangerous for all people whether they smoke or not. It is medically proven that a smoker dies sooner than does a non-smoker. Because they inhale the smoke, non-smokers also suffer from various diseases, and they can succumb to lung cancer by breathing in a smoky environment. The smoke also affects our senses. It causes us to lose the sense of taste, so we cannot enjoy the real taste of food in a smoky environment. Because of all these effects, smoking should be banned in restaurants because people go there to have great meal in a good environment. Therefore, to provide a good environment to the customers, restaurants should be cleaned, and they should have a smoke free environment. By doing so, people will enjoy their meal and enjoy themselves with their friends and family members in a smoke free, fresh, and healthy environment.

This is a more common thing for students who cannot afford materials for school. It is also common for young adults who are raising a family and are in need of greater income. For adults, it may be much easier to handle having a part-time job, but for working students it may be much harder. In my own experience, I sleep late to finish my projects, but for working students it is more challenging; they have to balance their time well. Many people take part-time jobs just to earn money or to earn more than they already are, but there are those who take part-time jobs because they want to give back to society. An example of these people may be college professors who already have a profession. An example of this may be an architect.

From developing complicated solutions and diagram graphing, to writing essays and theses, I disagree with students applying or working part-time jobs. Even though working part-time can give us a taste of what it is like in the working world, it may also drag our grades down due to the overwhelming responsibilities of both school and work. With both responsibilities, you have less time for recreational activities and even for sleep. You will have less time to make or bond with friends, thus having less time for social activities. In missing out on these activities, you will lose friends that may be beneficial in the future to help you out. You will not acquire the skills to socialize, which will also be needed in full-time employment. You may also acquire these skills in part-time jobs with your co-workers, but of course, it is different talking with friends than with older co-workers. I am not trying to take the privilege of working part-time away from those who really need it. It is just my opinion.

Some schools forbid students from working part-time because it violates school policy. Unfortunately, this does not stop students from taking different kinds of jobs for extra cash. Yet, working part time does not mean students need money to sustain only themselves, they may also need to sustain their families. There are some cases where a student's parents cannot afford the tuition for school, and the student must take matters into their own hands by stopping their education and working part-time, or occasionally taking a full-time job.

This is one reason why some students have a part-time job, to help or support themselves in achieving their goals and dreams in life. Through a part-time job, students can practice what is being taught in their classes because they can use their knowledge in the school and apply it to the company or employer that they work for. It can also help students to get more experience for future jobs.

There are also times when working students will lose interest in studying and would rather choose to work because, according to them, it is nice to earn money compared to studying the year long. It is really nice to be a working student because it has advantages, like earning money to be able to buy the things that you want, saving for the future, paying for expenses that you have, helping to pay your tuition fees, and increasing your self-esteem. It also helps you to build relevant skills and your ability to multi-task. Having a part-time job helps you to feel a sense of dignity and worth. In my own opinion, I think that part-time jobs are for students who are more competitive and very flexible in their work. Further, I find that it is more challenging for working students to compete in school activities. I think if you really want to help financially or to earn money, summer job opportunities are good because they are not hard and you can focus on what you’re doing.

Having a part-time job can help you, especially when you apply to a job that has a decent salary. Yet, as a student, I doubt you're going to find a job that offers a lot of money. Studying while working can cause you difficulties relating to your time and schedule. You must either sacrifice time for your studies or your job. Working isn't really needed in college when you still have your parents to support you. This doesn't mean that you'll let them pay until you have children. You'll just have to pay them back by doing little things for them like washing the dishes etc., especially when your grades are high. Your parents will really appreciate it; they won't regret giving you the money to study at a prestigious university.

The most common types of employment for part-time jobs are: bussing tables, babysitting, gas station attending, taking care of the elderly, doing secretarial work, library assistant, filing papers in offices, house to house, newspaper delivery, dog walking, and tutoring. Most of the time, college students are dependent on their parents, and must sometimes ask for a large amount of money to buy something that is not really needed. Because of this, college students should have part-time jobs to earn money so that they are not very dependent on their parents' money. Part-time jobs can give students the feeling of working and earning their own money and, in that way they, they will understand the value of money. Part-time jobs can also be a training ground for college students, preparing them for the future so that after they graduate they can be confident that they can survive in the real world. However, not all college students have parents who can support them financially and they can only go to college because of scholarships. Thus, such students get part-time jobs to help their parents financially and so that they do not feel that they are a burden to the family. Being a college student, there are a lot of things that we spend money on for education, so we need to get a part-time job to alleviate some of the financial burden on our parents. It can also help us to be more mature in handling money."

Poverty can be seen almost everywhere. Studying in De La Salle University – Manila, one of the country's most prestigious universities, I was given the opportunity to see the stark contrast in society as the slums encompass a significant area around the school campus. From what I could observe, poverty has taken its toll, most especially on the children. Deprived of education and proper parental guidance, many of them can be seen loitering outside the campus. Fortunately, however, there are those who have strived or in the local language “nag-kayod”, to rise from the slums. There are those impoverished who have diligently worked their way through college to earn a decent living for their families. One factor that enabled this is the prevalence of part-time jobs. These are jobs that are, well, not full-time. For businessmen this could mean fewer benefits to pay and the ability to be more flexible in terms of employee overhead. For the impoverished, however, it means the world to them. Part-time jobs can range anywhere from several hours work to several months. They range from cleaning other's cars or homes, to tutoring their kids, to working at fast food joints. Part-time jobs may seem detrimental to some, as they won't have occupational security; they are, nonetheless, essential for others, and in aggregate are beneficial for society."

It is like a training period for college students who are about to embark on their future career. It is also a source of income for independent students, for those who pay for their tuition, or for those who want to have an extra allowance. Having a part-time job also has its pros and cons, but these are based on the person taking the job. Maybe for some it is difficult but other people may enjoy every minute of it. People are never what they seem; it will always surprise you what people can really do in life. When you have a part-time job, you earn extra money and when you have extra money no one will stop you from buying whatever you want. Whether it's a Christian Dior dress or a Louis Vuitton bag, no one can stop you from buying those things since the money is yours and you have the right to spend it on anything that you want. People may think you're a spender but when you earn something by yourself and buy the things you want, you feel ecstatic, excited, happy, and proud of yourself. However, getting a part-time job depends on whether you are busy with school projects or not. Of course, studies are our first priority when it comes to school. Part-time jobs teach us how to prioritize our time because we have a part-time job for an additional allowance or for money, but study should always come first for college students around the world who have part-time jobs."

This is because tuition fees are inevitably increasing today. Some parents will have a hard time paying the tuition fees of their children. To lessen the burden our parents are carrying, we must have the guts to help them out. Another reason is for students to gain experience and to develop their strengths and weaknesses. Engaging ourselves with things that we do not usually do can help improve our well-being. One's personality can be changed through socializing and this can also help in applying for full-time jobs in the near future. One can be easily accepted by companies if they already have previous experience, most especially experience that enhances one's skills. Lastly, for students who do not have anything to do during their free hours, taking up a part-time job is the best way to occupy their time. Instead of engaging ourselves in unnecessary matters, we can help not only our family and self but also our country as well. In this way, one can gain extra income for future necessities."

People need to survive and cope with new environments every now and then. One noted term that one must always remember is “practicality”. Even if one faces a new world and begins a new chapter, one must always consider living practically. In Filipino communities, many families find it difficult to sustain their financial needs and can ill-afford to send their children to college. Yet these students are very eager to continue their college studies, to work, to earn, and to aspire for a more comfortable life. These college students work part-time jobs to assist and finance their studies. These part-time jobs are offered to students by various business and companies, a few of which are: crew members in fast-food chains, assistant librarians, and cashiers at a grocery store. Having a part-time job while studying is a really tedious task and involves the wise use of your time. Truly, working while studying and studying while working is a real sacrifice; one must sacrifice his/her free time and rest to work and study. Yet, at the end of the day it will be beneficial – he/she will finish his/her degree and have better opportunities to be employed. All this hard work will be compensated and they will be able to help others as well. Having been employed from an early age is not a disadvantage, it also gives the edge to these working students as they have hands-on experience at these jobs. Such students are able to learn and understand the flow of the business or organization that they work for. They will also have gained an additional network for their social life and, most importantly, they will have the money they need, gained from their own hard work."

Unless absolutely necessary, for example if the student is on his own and has to earn money to meet his needs, I believe that having a part-time job is a great distraction from education and will slowly but surely take a toll on the student's health. First of all, having a part-time job takes away one's time for study and rest. What would a day in the life of a college student with a part-time job be like? I'm quite sure that it is similar to that of a varsity player. The student would go to school, eat, go to work, finish study requirements and before he knows it, the day is up. He'll go to school again with only a few hours of sleep and not be able to concentrate in the discussions. Even while working, he will not be able to perform well and even if he can perform, he would still be worried and stressed out about school and the workload given by his professors. By simply having a part-time job, he puts his education at risk, when in fact his education is what will get him a good job in the future. Although having a part-time job forces the student to be responsible, to learn time management, and to work quickly and efficiently given a short period of time, and at the same time enable the student to earn money, that path will be extremely tough. He will need a brain that is fully rested, not sleep deprived. He will have to sacrifice a number of things. He will be going through a lot already as a student, thus it would be physically, mentally, and emotionally better if college students do not have to prioritize having part-time jobs just yet."

In my opinion, it is better for the child to focus more on his studies. It is the responsibility of the parents to provide sufficient funds for their children who are studying at university. It is their job to ensure that the child will have enough money to cover all of his expenses. It is the responsibility then of the student to do well in school to repay his parents hard work. Instead of getting a part-time job, it is better if the child saves his excess allowance to help his parents with via small acts. A child studies to acquire sufficient skills and training before facing the real world with confidence and knowledge. If the child has a part-time job, his time will be divided, which gives him less time to focus on his studies. If the child gives his undivided attention to his studies, he will be more able to acquire expertise. It would be more beneficial for the child to render his time fully to his studies to be sufficiently prepared. Also, not having a part-time job will lessen the burden and stress that school already causes for the child. Having a part-time job does have its pros, which include gaining money and real life experience, but it also means that the child will have less time for his studies and perhaps may later lose focus on them."

Students can afford to pay their tuition fees by earning money from their part-time jobs, which is also a way to help their families. Having a part-time job is hard, especially for organizing a student's schedule. According to television news in 2010, half of college graduates are working students, and every year this number increases, meaning that there are even more working students this year. Part-time jobs are also important because they help students gain knowledge and experience, which is a big help for future employment. Students may be faced with circumstances that they are able to handle because they have already experienced them; they can easily adapt to the job they are doing. On the other hand, students can also apply these skills to the course that they are taking and can apply what they learn from their course to their job. These are just some of the advantages of students having a part-time job. In doing this, hard work is needed and this hard work contributes to a better life.

Improvements in part-time jobs are one of the best innovations that companies are trying to use right now. The time that workers can spend at home or doing other important tasks has been greatly increased. This is why I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Part-time jobs, especially right now, help college students to become independent. Sometimes, to be able to get into a good university, a student may have to pay an exorbitant amount (tuition fees, books, etc). There are even students who choose to stay in dormitories, which of course they also have to pay for. What part-time jobs do for them is give them a source of income to meet their needs at the same time having time for studying. Moreover, it helps students get into good universities, even if their parents cannot pay expensive fees, precisely because they have another source of income. A popular part-time job is working in a call centre. If you think about it, call-centres work 24-7; thus students are able to tailor-fit their schedules in college with their work in these types of businesses. This means that their work does not interfere with their college education, which in the future may bring them more success. More than this, part-time jobs help create the picture that you are an experienced employee on your resume. In conclusion, this helps college students to get better opportunities in college and to be able to maximize their time and income. This is why part-time jobs, in all respects, are important for giving students the best quality education out there."

Part-time jobs are certainly an important part of our development as it trains us for the career we desire. Apart from this, they also train us to be independent and resourceful individuals of service. This is why getting a part-time job can be very beneficial at this point. College students are encouraged to get involved in part-time jobs since these can provide experience in the working arena. They are also conducive for graduate students who are transitioning from student life to the working world because they will learn what to expect out there. Apart from this, such jobs and experiences can train students to handle bigger responsibilities. Sure, college loads us with many responsibilities; however, part-time jobs provide training that is a step further from what college and schooling can offer as they train us how to handle responsibilities whereby not only our own interests are important. In college, we are trained to comply with the professor's requirements and adhere to the school's regulations. On the other hand, part-time jobs train students to comply with the general public's expectations and adhere to the regulations of the larger community. The benefits of these jobs, however, are not limited to the development and training they can offer.

Through working hard, students can become more responsible with their money, and their personality. Students don't want to spend their hard-earned money on useless things, so they'll become wiser regarding how they spend their money. What about their personality? Through working with other colleagues or with customers individuals can become more socially-capable. This will help them in the future when they are looking for a real job by preparing them for what the real world will throw at them. However, having a part-time job also has its negatives. What time the job starts can affect the academics of the student. Is it safe? Different jobs may also have some risks associated. However, this can be avoided if you pick a good job and a safe place to work. In short, jobs may seem boring and tiring, but it will be ultimately beneficial financially.

Part-time jobs may cause the student's attention to be divided from his/her studies.

If you smoke like one cigarette per day or just when you are stressed from work it is okay. Banning smoking in restaurants across the country appears to be somewhat unfair to some. There are smoking lounges in some restaurants and these are a better way to solve this problem. There should be a separate area for smokers and non-smokers. In this way, non-smokers won't be affected or be second-hand smokers. Banning won't be the solution to the problem of smoking. Do you really expect that people will completely follow that regulation? I don't think so, unless there are heavy consequence. This still depends on the respect and responsiveness of the people around you. In our country, I don't really see people smoking inside restaurants. I do see people smoking outside air-conditioned places, but I haven't seen anyone smoking inside the mall or wherever they want. Maybe smoking can be banned in restaurants that don't have smoking areas, this would be the best. We must also take into consideration those who already gone to the effort of creating smoking areas."

Cigarettes not only affect the user but also the people near them. This is because the smoke coming from the cigarette that is exhaled by the smoker disseminates through the air and is inhaled by nearby people. These people will inhale the second-hand smoke. Even though it is called “second-hand” its effects are greater than those for the smoker. It is really important to have a no smoking policies in all restaurants so that the cleanliness in the surrounds and in the air is maintained. It also garners good comments from people who go to the restaurants because smoking in an area makes the place feel like it is not a formal place. Restaurants have their own rules, and one of the most important rules is to serve customers well and to know the saying that “the customers is always right”. This means that every restaurant needs to be ready to meet the needs of every customer they may have. For example, if their customer is a smoker they have to talk with him/her kindly to inform them that they don't allow cigarettes in their restaurant, or to bring him/her to a place where there are no customers that may be affected so that no problems will occur."

Smoking just a single cigarette can cause hundreds of toxins to enter the body. Some of the toxins that are present in a cigarette stick are nicotine, which is addictive and increases the level of cholesterol in the body; carbon monoxide, which reduces the oxygen in the body; and tar, which is a carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) and gets accumulated in the air passages of the lung. If these are the toxins that enter your body, imagine what will happen if you smoke in a restaurant where there are families bringing their kids, pregnant mothers, and people who have asthma. In this type of environment, if you smoke, there will be a lot of second-hand smokers who will also inhale the toxins that are present in the fumes of the cigarette. If a person in the restaurant has asthma, there is a high possibility that inhaling a cigarette's fumes may trigger an asthma attack. Aside from that, if you smoke in a restaurant, it can also cause second-hand smokers' cancer, especially in the lungs, as well as cardiovascular diseases, emphysema, vascular diseases, and other obstructive lung diseases. If you smoke in a restaurant and there is a pregnant mother who inhales the fumes of the cigarette, the baby will not have enough oxygen and will be born small for its gestational age. As a conclusion, if you smoke inside a restaurant, not only smokers will experience the bad effects but also the people who are inside the restaurant. So either smokers should not smoke inside restaurants or they should go to a place where there is no one around to smoke."

Whether it is outside our homes, near our schools, along roads, in malls, and even outside hospitals, people smoke. Recently, however, smoking has begun to take flak. There have been clamours to ban smoking in public areas, specifically restaurants, as it is hazardous to public health and therefore public interest. Blessed with the opportunity for education, we have learned from a very young age the risks and perils of smoking, and equally important – second-hand smoke. From consequences such as addiction and reduced cardiovascular endurance to possible death, smoking, and the even more hazardous unfiltered second-hand smoke, clearly are not things to be taken lightly. People patronize restaurants despite their higher prices compared with convenience stores, fast food, and cafeterias, not only because of the usually better tasting food options but also because of the ambiance – the environment. Despite the sheer number of smokers in the country, there are also many who value their health and, as such, support the notion of penalizing smoking in restaurants. This is why I believe that it is in the interest of the majority, and therefore the public, that smoking be generally banned in restaurants across the country, but with a few reservations. We cannot impede the smokers' own rights; therefore, I also believe that smoking should be allowed in select food institutions that cater primarily to smokers."

In my opinion, smoking should be banned from all restaurants for many reasons that I think almost everyone will agree with. Smoking is one of the problems people encounter on the streets, in their daily life, and especially in restaurants. Some restaurants these days have provided smoking areas for smokers. For me, this is a good thing since it does not bother or affect other people who are enjoying their time with their family and friends. Yet, in my opinion, smoking should be banned in restaurants even if they offer a smoking lounge because it affects the health of other people, especially second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers may not be directly smoking but it affects them more than those who are. All of us have opinions about smoking, but it really depends on who you are asking about this issue. Hopefully, smokers around the world will realize that smoking has a bad effect in their lives. We can't really blame those who are addicted to smoking but I think they should be reminded."

This is because restaurants were purposely designed to feed customers. They were invented mainly to serve food and drink, not to provide entertainment that may cause harm to other people. Moreover, it would be unfair to other customers if smoking in restaurants is tolerated. Others who go to restaurants to dine and those who serve at the restaurant may endure diseases caused by the inhalation of smoke produced by cigarettes. It is very dangerous to health, most especially to second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are those who do not directly inhale smoke but eventually digest it into their lungs. They are the ones who unintentionally inhale the smoke produced by smokers. Restaurants should not only consider profit but should also consider the effects their services might have on their customers. Their main goal should be to provide services that have good effects on their customers. Health is a lot more important than money and should be considered first before anything else.

However, some people tend to do things that offend other people without knowing it. For example, when some customers smoke inside a restaurant, many people are affected by the smoke that they exhale. The smoker not only affects the people within or near their occupied table, but all of the people that are dining inside. Second-hand smoke: the smoke that the smoker exhales and other people inhales, is very dangerous because it contains carbon monoxide and other gaseous toxins that have adverse effects on our body. Even when smokers smoke outside, it still affects other customers that are trying to enjoy and unwind with the food and ambience of the restaurant. Smoking not only disturbs the customers but it also poses a threat to the smoker as well, as it contains harmful gases that damage their system. Smoking in restaurants should be banned in the country to save peoples’ right to enjoy the food and ambience offered by the place, and to not be exposed to the cancerous smoke exhaled by a selfish customer."

The smoke, the smell, all of it is hazardous to the health of the smoker and even more so to those who inhale the smoke second-hand. Moreover, smoking just contributes even more to the already polluted air around us. Second, since cleanliness in restaurants should always be maintained, there is no reason not to kick-out smokers. In addition, it is important to eat clean food, especially since doing otherwise may result in sicknesses, stomach aches, and the like. Smoking in restaurants simply spreads the dust, and other dirty particles all over the place. Third, there are many people around with asthma or allergies to dust. Smokers can unintentionally blow on the face of these people and cause unwanted accidents or attacks. Who knows? Besides, whether with asthma or without, I am sure no one likes walking into a cloud of smoke at a restaurant, or anywhere for that matter, and getting the full blast of pollution right in their faces. No one would want their children to experience that just before entering a restaurant.

Smoking has various negative effects. Second-hand smokers or those who inhale smoke from those who smoke cigarettes, are the ones who are more prone to the negative effects of smoking. The cigarettes smoked by cigarette smokers have filters which make the smoke less bad than the smoke second-hand smokers inhale. Inhaling smoke or the smoking act itself can trigger certain diseases. The deadliest disease that is possible to develop is lung cancer. I have been to a museum where a section showcased lungs at different stages of lung cancer. I saw how black the lungs where, even when the cancer had been present for only 3 to 6 months. At the end of the cycle of the cancer, I saw how regular sized lungs shrink to a size smaller than an orange. On the other side of the table, if the ban is passed into a law, the companies who manufacture cigarettes will lose profits and may latter become bankrupt. Banning the smoking of cigarettes only focusing on the health of the citizen may be inconsiderate as we do not consider the other side of the table which benefits from cigarettes. To sum, I am for the ban of smoking though I consider the side of the manufactures as well.

Most restaurants are air conditioned; they don't allow smokers inside their restaurants but they still damage the freshness of the air outside. Some restaurants allow smokers to smoke, but only in the smoking area. Smoking is already a part of a smoker's life; some smoke after eating and some smoke during a drinking session. Some say that it makes them feel better and calms them but they don't even think about what smoking can do, not only to their health but also to their life. They don't think about their surroundings and the people that might be affected. As we all know, smoking is very dangerous to one's health and can cause you to develop lung cancer. It affects not only your lungs but also the other internal organs of your body. It also affects the health of the second-hand smokers and workers inside restaurants.

Some scientists even say that one of these chemicals is used in rocket fuel. Yet smoking poses even greater threats to other individuals in the proximity of the smoker. This is what we call third-hand or third party smoking. Why is this more dangerous? It is because the smoke that comes out of the cigarette is more impure than that inhaled by the smoker. This is why the risk it poses increases exponentially. This is also the reason why I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. I have two reasons why the risk of endangering individuals will increase if we continue to let smoking happen. One, these are public places, places where a lot of individuals gather to eat. Even if we say that there are smoking areas, the mere proximity of the smoker could have third-hand smoking effects. Second, people can just go to private bathrooms or more secluded areas to smoke. It is only in these private spots that we can be sure that they are not harming other people in the process of engaging in their bad habit. The state has the imperative to ban smoking, precisely because public health is concerned here. They have a moral obligation to the people because their quality of life deteriorates every second that they inhale third-hand smoke. Just because smokers have the right to smoke themselves to death, they should not include other individuals in this process."

Apart from being utterly dangerous and life-threatening to both first-hand and second-hand smokers, it is simply a violation of social etiquette. This especially applies to public places like restaurants. Just imagine how crazily annoying it would be to have smokers ruin your appetite just when your food arrives. The smoke will surely mess with the appetizing aroma of your food. Eventually, your whole food experience will seem unfulfilling and just plain terrible. This is why banning smoking in such places would be good for our society. Restaurants are closed areas; therefore, smoking inside such areas can cause a lot of discomfort for everyone in the restaurant. Clearly, it is not only those who are trying to enjoy a nice meal that are affected. Even those just chilling-out in the area are also being bombarded with the distasteful smell and smoke. In short, smoking in restaurants and other public places exposes random people to harm. Still, it is not only the customers who experience this dilemma with smoking. By smoking in such places, one also threatens the restaurant since it definitely discourages customers. Smoking ruins the ambiance that the restaurant works to establish for their customers to enjoy. Therefore, implementing a law regarding smoking would be best. Smoking should definitely be banned in restaurants and the like. Needless to say, smoking is harmful and incredibly annoying."

Asking about whether or not smoking should be banned is just the same as asking the Pope if he's a Christian. Regarding my stance on whether or not smoking should be banned from restaurants, I'll say it bluntly: why the heck not? Another thing about smoking is that it turns people off when they are trying to eat. Who wants to eat when smoke fumes are floating around your face? Why eat at a smoky restaurant, when you can eat at someplace better? The health risks of such a practice are also a con here. Why risk your health when you can live a healthier life and have a better dining experience in a smoke-free place? Children's health should also be considered here. Would you risk your son's or daughter's health just to smoke a cigarette? My stance is they should ban it. Can't you wait to get outside and smoke? Can't you resist the urge to light-up a cigarette? Do you have no shame for the diners who just want a good meal or atmosphere? Let me just say that I don't have anything against smokers, but they should learn to do it at the right time and in the right place. Nobody wants to inhale your smoke.

I agree that smoking should be completely banned from all restaurants because it is detrimental to one's health. Numerous diseases and illnesses including asthma, cardio pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), and lung cancer may be acquired through smoking. Smoking is not only dangerous to the smoker but also to the person sitting next to him. Second-hand smokers, they say, are more at risk of receiving the negative effects of smoking. Smoking may also cause addiction because it includes the substance nicotine. Smoking in restaurants implies that the smoker has no social etiquette because he/she doesn't consider that smoking may irritate other people, and worse, it may also endanger their health. Many actions have been implemented by the government to lessen this habit, including the recent declaration by President Benigno Aquino III, who is a known smoker, that smoking must be prohibited in all public places and there will be penalties for non-abiders. In order for the government to be successful, strict law enforcement must be administered by authorities and the willing cooperation of the citizens is necessary.

Being a college student requires a certain level of commitment to academia, and the decision to be enrolled in a college already sets a priority of education  above anything else like having a part-time job. A reason why someone would attend college is so that they can attain a degree in order to secure better future job prospects. Having a part-time job is not only time-consuming but usually requires effort and would be physically tiring. This would affect the student's concentration and focus in school when both the college and part-time job workloads take their toll on the student. Also, there would be a lack of time for the student to sufficiently study and revise what is being taught. Thus, students should focus on the long-term goal of obtaining a good degree rather than be lured by the extra pocket money offered by part-time jobs. Of course, there is the argument that some college students are good at time management and can juggle school and their part-time job well enough. Although this might be the case for a select number of students, I still feel that having a part-time job is not important. I feel that the only exception whereby part-time jobs can be seen as important for college students is if the part-time job they take up is for work experience or research related to what they are pursuing in college. Hence, a part-time job may be important only if it is for an internship. Otherwise, a part-time job should not be a priority or seen as important for college students."

Having a part-time job exposes college students to things they have not learned or will never learn in school. This is increasingly important as the working world now demands more than just academic understanding. First, real life experiences play an equally important, if not more important, role in academic studies. Having a part-time job allows college students to interact with people of different ages, professions, and goals. Compared to interacting with their schoolmates, this is a new form of interaction that requires a different set of skills. Second, while working on the job, they will face difficulties that they have not encountered before and hence they will be pressured to come up with solutions. This is an opportunity for them to apply what they have learned as well as to think outside the box and solve problems with novel solutions. Third, students of this generation have led a relatively comfortable and pampered life. With a part-time job, they will understand the hardships of working and be more appreciative of their parents. Furthermore, they can learn to be more independent by earning money for their own needs and wants. However, part-time jobs should be carefully selected. Not all part-time jobs give the same benefits. Jobs that are illegal or dangerous should not be considered as it will produce net harm.

They can also save for their own future and things such as school fees for overseas universities, which would end up being a significant addition to college tuition. Even though academics are the main focus, students also can realize the importance of having work experience. Society nowadays expects students to have working experience, so part-time jobs are started as early as in college and internships are included in school modules for students to gain practical experience off-campus and gain nourishment from the outer world. Students also understand that it would help foster values, better communication skills, honed time management skills, and help students pick up relevant skills through the working environment. It helps to take chances with a killer cover letter and resume, standing out and impressing their future employer.

Whether or not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and priorities. College life may have long breaks in between semesters, which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job. This can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or new accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship at a company or prepare for the upcoming classes they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a means to fill their excess time. It also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during the semester as there will be less time to spare for the student to do their academic work. Having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can similarly enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that having a part-time job in college is not necessary unless there are circumstances or needs that the students have to satisfy."

However, I agree that it is beneficial for college students to have a part-time job if they have good time management. First, getting a part-time job is the first step in learning how to be independent, and university is the best time to do so. In university, course choices and education are more self-directed than in junior college or high school, so most college students have much free time on their hands. Having a part-time job is thus a good way of making wise use of their time while earning their own income. Second, a part-time job can act as a bridge between college education and students’ careers in the future. This is especially so when their part-time job relates to what they hope to do in the future. For example, some students may choose to take up a part-time job in a healthcare institution if their course of study is healthcare-related, such as nursing, medicine, or pharmacy. Their part-time jobs will allow them to get a better understanding of how the industry or organization really works, and thus makes their learning more meaningful. Even if their part-time job is different from their course of study, students will still be able to learn universal skills like teamwork, communication skills, and the importance of spending money wisely that will help them in their future. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job more important than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond academia, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades that they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in the future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisurely pursuits rather than a job. Meanwhile, a final hypothetical student might be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardize their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all students."

Polytech students like me have many breaks in a year. For example, we have six weeks around August to go out to work and earn money to buy our textbooks and pay our expenses. This way, we do not have to rely on our parents to give us all our pocket money. Having this part-time job can also allow us to learn how to be independent and understand the difficulty of earning money so that we will not squander our parents' money away by spending on things that are not necessary. By having a part-time job, students are also able to learn social skills and how to interact with other people and try out different kinds of jobs until finding one that is suitable. We can also learn what our strengths are and what field we could work in when we graduate from our tertiary education. Therefore, overall, I agree that students should have a part-time job. Even a less time-consuming part-time job would suffice."

College students, mostly in their 20s, are adults with social lives that require money, such as going out for dinners or shopping for clothes. Therefore, having an income (even a small one) is useful for college students in ensuring that their social lives are not compromised during the school term. Moreover, having to rely on parents for additional income can be a little embarrassing and may put a strain on their financial resources. Therefore, I feel that it is better for college students to have their own income. While it can sometimes be tough to manage one's time, especially with assignments and other school commitments, students still have the opportunity to be flexible with their part-time job by taking fewer shifts or quitting (as a last resort), since they are not obliged to continue in the long term. Part-time jobs that enable flexibility include being a tutor or working on an ad-hoc basis by modeling or screen-writing. I therefore conclude that it is imperative that college students have a part-time job in order to keep up with their social lifestyles and not burden their parents, some of whom may already be retired."

I could not understand why all my knowledge had basically disappeared in the short span of two years. So, in addition to getting monetary income, I had another reason to pick up my lost skills again, as I had to prove to myself that I did have the concepts contained in those two subjects within my reach. In addition, I had the chance to reinforce those concepts in the process of teaching my student verbally because I was rehearsing my knowledge of the subject matter and solidifying my grasp on said concepts. Altogether, I had a very enriching experience being a private tutor, as I loved learning and academia in general. In the process, I developed important interpersonal communication skills, for example by being articulate and patient. Of course, having a stable source of income did not hurt either."

However, some students get too obsessed with the idea of making money that they sometimes forget that their top priority as a student should be to concentrate on their academics. They take on more shifts, sacrificing their valuable and limited time that they should ideally be using for their schoolwork or to study. If the need to make money is so strong because they need to buy so many things, then perhaps it is time to let go of such a materialistic lifestyle and learn to be happy with what they already have instead. Part-time jobs teach us responsibility, but they should not affect our performance in school. We will have the rest of their lives to work.

Time is very precious to a college student (in contrast to a secondary school student), and the amount of time and effort is simply not worth a few bucks per hour. However, should the student have spare time on his or her hands, it would be good to get a part-time job. Having a part time job allows the student to get a taste of the working world and it could be useful in the future when applying for a job. Also, additional income wouldn't hurt anyone. A part-time job would be more suitable if it's during school vacation. Having a job during the school term might cause students to burn out.

One can take away life's lessons, such as diligence, patience, team work, and social skills. This benefits the person for the entirety of their life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point in their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them learn some life lessons will definitely benefit them for the rest of their lives. The students also receive monetary benefits, which are always welcome, because tuition fees are always escalating, as is the cost of living and one's financial responsibility to support aging parents. Therefore, it is imperative that students, wherever possible and if they are physically able, to contribute to the household income by working part-time. Students can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put them in good stead for future job hires.

Part-time jobs that actively look into recruiting students usually belong to the service, food and beverage, and retail industries. The jobs offered are usually shift-based with a minimum number of working days and working hours, giving students a considerable amount of flexibility when planning their schedule for the week or the month. Having a part-time job provides learning experiences for the student that they otherwise would not have in school. Following work commitments, managing relationships with colleagues, time management, stress management, and learning new skills are some of the things a student can achieve if they have a part-time job. By joining the workforce earlier, the student may enjoy an easier transition from their role as a student to being part of the workforce upon graduation. In addition, working part-time also encourages the student to be financially independent by earning their own money. However, having a part-time job can be time-consuming because of the weekly commitment. The time that could have been allocated to assignment research or exam revision could be significantly compromised because of job requirements. In addition, the fatigue and lack of rest can lead to less productivity when the student eventually settles down to finish their schoolwork. This may impact their grades and harm their progress in their studies. To conclude, I would recommend students to only look for a part-time job if they have limited income at home. Otherwise, students should fully immerse themselves in college life and enjoy the facilities while they have the luxury of time to do so. It is more important to enjoy their role as a student and to excel in it rather than to focus on getting a part-time job."

It is never said that college students should be working part-time and I can confirm that both my parents are very against the idea. In many ways, working part-time is very time-consuming. It will take a large portion of time away from the students' already hectic life. Students would have to juggle study and work which will definitely result in poor grades. Having to work part-time during my holidays proves my point in that it is never easy to balance between even just work and play; so how to include studying? Partaking in a part-time job to some is a double-edged sword. For some, it is necessary. Poverty-stricken students need to work to pay college fees while others see it as an opportunity to get first-hand experience of work life after graduation as an adult. Hence, I disagree that it is important for college students to hold a part-time job while studying to a certain extent. A student’s job is to study, unless there is a compelling reason to work such as being exposed to a golden opportunity for learning. In contrast, I think that high school students should get a part-time job instead, because the workload they have is much lighter and they don’t have internships, which college students get to have."

In this case, having a part-time job would be a priority for the individual, as without the salary earned from the part-time job, the individual would be unable to pay college tuition and attend college. However, while maybe not important in most other cases, having a part-time job can still be beneficial. The salary earned from part-time jobs allows college students a certain amount of financial autonomy and teaches them independence. Besides, earning a little extra pocket money never hurts. College students who have to juggle both their studies and part-time work are also trained to have good time management. This is a useful skill to learn in life. In addition, part-time jobs contribute to the individual work experience, and is a good chance for a person to learn about workforce etiquette. In conclusion, having a part-time job is only important in some, not all, situations.

A part-time job, foremost, can provide students with a source of income. This will reduce some of the financial burden that their educational fees and other miscellaneous spending place on their families. Working for their own income (or a portion thereof) also nurtures in them a responsibility for managing their personal spending and earning patterns. It is likely that experiencing the effort required to generate income will incentivize frugality and wiser spending decisions. Furthermore, part-time jobs allow students to hone new or existing skills. A tutoring job, for example, not only allows the student to keep their mind active and constantly practice a subject, but also forces them to acquire a whole new trove of skills relating to teaching. An administrative job can prepare the student for administrative work - which exists in most regular jobs - required in the future, as well as allow them to exercise organizational skills. On the other hand, a part-time job may distract a student from their studies. A significant amount of time and effort inevitably has to be dedicated to the job, and this comes at the opportunity cost of revision and other school work. Should the student not be able to cope with both simultaneously, it would definitely be better for them to focus on their studies and perhaps take up a temporary job during the holidays instead.

Moreover, students can make friends in their working circle and understand how to navigate the working world after graduation. Many students take up tutoring assignments which are ad-hoc and easy to manage around their time-table, while others seek jobs during the weekends or at night after their lessons. Part-time jobs are usually popular with people who have other more serious commitments, but have some spare time in which they would like a change in environment, or earn some money. Personally, I have worked as a packer at a florist's packing hampers during the Chinese New Year holidays. Although I was required to work overtime and was given minimal wages, I look back on those days with fondness now remembering my friendly co-workers and my pride in my first (albeit low) salary.

It is therefore exceptionally beneficial for students to partake in some form of temporary or part-time job in the hours outside of class to support their growing expenditures. They will be less reliant on parents' allowances or avoid the need to scrimp and save, allowing for more self-sufficiency and growing pride in the ability to support themselves. While it is certainly good to gain some financial independence, the trade-off for such part-time jobs would be reduced time spent on studies, on making friends and networks that can only be made in college, and spending less time on extra-curricular activities that will develop into useful skills and interests for life. Moreover, part-time jobs usually have meager pay, and the learning opportunities for a temporary staff member is small to say the least - the costs of such a job can far outweigh its returns, and thus students may be better off not having a part-time job. Therefore, it is sometimes far more important to make sure one is making full use of his or her college life - a once in a lifetime occurrence - rather than spend precious time slaving away for a little bit of money."

The salary obtained, although minimal, would definitely lessen the burden on the student’s family or provide them with an additional income for expenses. Additionally, the part-time job could also serve as a meaningful experience for the person. However, I disagree that it is important for college students to work part-time if they are financially comfortable or if they are unable to cope with their schoolwork. In this case, the commitment to part-time work would be an added burden and not a bonus for them. Alternatively, they should use their spare time to catch up on their work or use it on their hobbies or for their leisure since time will be a luxury after they graduate.

First, scientific studies have proven that secondhand smoke - smoke produced from smoking - poses a bigger health threat than smoking itself because the smoke produced contains more carcinogens and unfiltered chemicals than what is inhaled by the smoker. Allowing smoking at restaurants would expose everyone, especially children and the elderly, to health risks. Most restaurants are air-conditioned, which makes it worse because there is no ventilation for the smoke produced and it is inevitable that restaurant-goers would have to inhale and deal with the smoke produced. Second, smoking is a form of air pollution and can disrupt restaurant goers enjoying their meal and company. Most restaurant goers would simply want to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant without having to deal with the unnecessary smoke or the unpleasant smell that smoking produces, unless they are smokers themselves. For the greater public good, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country, as restaurants should be respected as public places equivalent to hospitals, schools, and airports, where a smoking ban has already been imposed. Also, it is not completely unreasonable to ban smoking completely at restaurants because there are other more suitable and appropriate areas for smokers to smoke."

This is because there is overall harm if smoking is not prohibited. Smoking produces a foul smell that some people dislike, and consumers do not want to dine in an environment that is uncomfortable. Furthermore, not only is smoking harmful to the smoker, it causes more damage to the people around them. Secondhand smokers have a higher probability of contracting lung disease. While some may argue that this is only likely if the person is exposed to secondhand smoke for a long period of time, if smoking is not completely banned, consumers are likely to encounter smokers meal after meal. This will then be detrimental to their health. Consumers include children and elderly, and smoke can even cause more damage to them. In addition, if smoking is not banned by law, restaurant owners can face difficulty in declining to offer service to smokers. Consumers may be deterred from entering the restaurant and hence cause the restaurant to suffer losses. These disadvantages of allowing smoking in restaurants outweigh the advantages. If smoking is not completely banned, smokers will be able to exercise freedom in enjoying their cigarettes. This will be in accordance with their human rights. In conclusion, given that it is more beneficial to ban smoking, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."

In fact, it is becoming more and more popular. The government has set up smoking areas in certain locations, and certain restaurants also provide a smoking area for their customers so that they will be able to smoke and at the same time contribute to the restaurant’s sales. Therefore, it does not just benefit the smokers by being convenient, but it also helps restaurants. Smoking is a bad habit of humanity, and it does not just hurt the smoker themselves but also the surrounding people who might end up breathing secondhand smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because if restaurants provide smoking area services, it will tend to attract more smokers to their restaurant. This hurts themselves and also the public who might breathe the secondhand smoke. Over time, smokers tend to depend on smoking even more, and non-smokers might get influenced and join them, and it will become a serious problem in the near future. In conclusion, taking everything into consideration, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country."

Smoking is bad for not just the smoker’s health but also the health of people around them. At restaurants, diners have the right to fully enjoy their dining experience. If smoking is not completely banned, many diners will either have to suffer in silence and be engulfed in the smoke or to choose an alternative place to dine at. The reason it should be completely banned and not partially or fully unbanned is simple: smoke can diffuse easily in air, which can spread to a much further location from the point where the smoker is. The foul smoke from the smoker can easily affect many tables around them. Even with demarcation for smokers, the smoke does not restrict itself from spreading to non-demarcated areas. Thus, other non-smoking diners will still be able to smell the smoke. Another reason for banning smoking is that it encourages smokers to quit smoking. With fewer places to smoke, it will make smoking more inconvenient and can have a positive effect on smokers. Some may argue that smokers have the right to do what they want, but if this right infringes on others who have the right to fresh air, the smokers should just give in. It is also inconsiderate for smokers to pollute the air, especially if the restaurant is air-conditioned, which slows the dissipation of the foul smell. Therefore, for the above reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."

Will that affect your enjoyment of your dinner? For me, it most definitely would, and thus I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants, for two main reasons. First, second-hand cigarette smoke has been found to be extremely harmful, and is even more harmful to innocent passers-by than to the smokers themselves. This means that smokers are actually bringing harm upon others when the smoke they exhale gets inhaled by the people around them. Would you want to enter a restaurant where you cannot breathe without inhaling all the poisonous fumes from other patrons' smoking? Most likely not, and therefore for the sake of their customers, restaurants should prohibit smoking within their premises. Second, smoking does not fit in well with the ambiance that restaurants aim to provide their patrons. What we associate with smoking is the image of a slightly unkempt person in shorts and slippers and horrible-smelling breath; in other words, highly unappealing. On the other hand, restaurants are portrayed as high-class with delicious food. Thus, for the sake of their business, smoking should be banned so as to preserve their image. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants, as it will benefit both the restaurant and the patrons."

While it is definitely unfair to subject innocents to their secondhand smoke while they're trying to eat, it would also seem unfair to make it impossible for smokers who enjoy smoking before, during, or after a meal when eating out, especially in cases where it would not affect others. As someone who is personally hypersensitive to smoke and other funky nasal intrusions, I do believe that certain areas - especially in restaurants, where smell is an important part of the experience - should be kept smoke free. However, when it comes to bigger restaurants in particular, and those that are open-air, having a separate smoking section away from the rest of the restaurant patrons would not hurt anyone. Smokers would get to smoke, non-smokers would get a smoke-free environment, the restaurant would get more money, and everyone would be happy until they see the bill. Alternatively, there could be some restaurants that allow smoking while others ban it completely, and if non-smokers want to eat at a restaurant permitting smoking, they'll just have to put up with the smoke as a compromise. Likewise, if a smoker wants to eat at a non-smoking restaurant, they'd also have to compromise by, well, not smoking. Diversity is key: having more options available to meet everyone's needs as best as possible, harming as few as possible in the process. Absolutism of any sort is terrifying, and should never be allowed to stand anywhere outside of a totalitarian society."

However, they should put a boundary up to draw a line  between smoking and non-smoking areas. This way, the smoke will not affect the non-smoking customers. The smokers can also enjoy their dinner at restaurants with their friends without having to bear the pain of not being able to light a cigarette. However, the problem of the smoke lingering in air-conditioned restaurants is a cause of concern. The smoke may stay in the restaurant for a very long time and it will be very difficult to get rid of the smoke. Therefore, if the restaurants want to allow smoking, they should have a partition to separate smoking and non-smoking areas. They should also make the smoking area not air-conditioned so as to prevent the smoke from lingering in the air and causing air pollution. It will also affect the health of the workers who are there to deliver the food or clean the place, as they will be breathing in second-hand smoke. If the restaurant wants to legalize smoking, they should be considerate to the non-smokers who want to enjoy a peaceful dinner with their dates."

Although I am not a smoker, I have friends who are and I empathize with their situation here in Singapore, where there are many areas that are out of bounds to smokers. There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke interferes with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can help smokers take a break and relax during their meals. This will definitely be more appreciated than banning smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironic, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. If the government wants to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that creates confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular."

This effectively spreads the harmful substances all over our body. Please, if I ever need a poignant reminder of the aforementioned harmful effects, I would just buy a pack and stare at the tasteful illustrations of gangrenous tissue ravaged by years and years of chain smoking. But wait, what is inside the box- wow! What a shame it would be to see those twenty perfectly new and viable cigarettes go to waste. You see, no one talks about the other side effect of smoking: you feel good. No, I correct myself: you feel bloody good. It’s as if a low rumble of euphoria washes over your entire being, not unlike the high from alcohol, except slower. It is also a great tool for socialization. Imagine petty little deviants like me all congregating in those stupid yellow boxes, packed like sardines, puffing away.

On top of hurting themselves, they are also unknowingly hurting everyone around them by making them passive smokers and polluting the air. I hated it when I found out that my friends were smoking. I told them to stop but even until today, I am not truly sure if they have stopped smoking. I really hope that they have stopped. I do not see any positives about smoking actually, it wastes money as cigarettes are in fact really expensive and do harm. I sincerely hope that in the future, fewer people will be smoking cigarettes. According to my mother, my father used to be a smoker when he was younger. Thankfully, he stopped smoking before my parents got married. Since my father could stop in the past with no form of rehabilitation, I feel that this generation of smokers should have it easier because they can find help to stop smoking.

It has only been a hypothesis, and we fail to understand that statistics do not indicate the truth of scientific theories. Consider the hypothesis: 80% of people who eat broccoli die of cancer. It seems very intuitive to say that broccoli causes cancer, which we can acknowledge is a very absurd claim. What we fail to consider upon first glance is that the number of people who eat broccoli is very high, and this large group of people get cancer as much any other groups of people due to all sorts of factors, such as genetics.

For example, if smoking was allowed on McDonalds premises, then a lot of children would inhale secondhand smoke, and especially if it starts so young, it can cause lung cancer in the future. Also, bans are only in restaurants; it's not the entire country. Smokers can still have a cigarette after their meal. Surely, they are not so addicted to smoking that they can't spare a good 10-20 minutes for a meal. From the business perspective, I would segregate areas for smokers and non-smokers, as having a smoking area might play a part in deciding on where to dine. This is costly to the business either way. Without the smoking area, you might lose customers who are smokers. With the smoking area, you lose customers who don't appreciate the smoking. Further, just having two different areas costs more than having two different sections. For example, having an indoor and outdoor area. This means higher costs for a larger space, as it's not possible to segregate two distinct areas in an enclosed place. Without the ban in restaurants, you can sell cigarettes, which could boost sales. Overall, it's better not to have a smoking ban in restaurants. It benefits the general public and the smoker."

The reason is that I feel smoking harms society by causing multiple diseases and posing health risks to both the smoker and the people inhaling secondhand smoke. By banning smoking, we can cut down on health care costs because fewer people will fall ill from the smoke, which means there would be less strain on the national healthcare system. Banning smoking also allows all diners to eat in peace, and so that their appetites are not ruined from inhaling poisonous smoke while they are eating. In my view, I think that smoking is not a bad thing in itself, as long as smokers know the risks to their health and they choose to do it. The key thing that they should take note of is that the smoke can possibly harm all the people that inhale the smoke, including family siting close by. Therefore, by banning smoking, the law will actually help to protect family members from health risks. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be banned, simply because it is reasonable to not want to inhale secondhand smoke, and as a non-smoker, we should have the right and privilege to not inhale smoke. I value my health highly and do not wish to compromise it."

The harmful side effects of smoking not only affect the smokers, but secondhand smokers as well. Secondhand smokers are the people who inhale the smoke that the smokers exhale from their bodies. It is not only harmful, but even more harmful than the smoke inhaled by a smoker from a cigarette. In a restaurant where there are many patrons enjoying meals, many of them will be non-smokers who dislike the smell of cigarettes. It is unpleasant to inhale smoke that both damages the body and is the result of another person's careless behavior. It is polite for the smokers to leave the restaurant and smoke at a designated place, because it shows consideration and basic courtesy. I firmly believe that non-smokers have the rights to stay within premises that are free from cigarette smoke. While smokers have the right to choose to smoke, it should not be at the expense of innocent non-smokers who have chosen not to smoke. By allowing smoking within restaurants, non-smokers are at the mercy of the poisonous second-hand smoke. By exercising this right, customers can have their meals in an environment that does not harm them in any way. Just like how hygiene is of utmost importance during food preparation due to health concerns, smoking can be comparable to the effects of food poisoning, if not more severe. To conclude, the long-term side effects of smoking would harm people and outweigh any costs of implementing a no-smoking policy countrywide. In order to effectively implement the no-smoking policy, all restaurants should participate and strictly enforce the policy. This would positively contribute to the efforts in reducing nicotine addiction worldwide."

In Singapore, smoking in restaurants has already been banned. A designated area is required to smoke not just in restaurants but even in hawker and shopping cents. Smokers, on the other hand, think that this is against their rights and freedom. In my opinion, however, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. The primary reason people visit restaurants is to eat, not to smoke. We have to consider the various health issues. In a setting like restaurants, with air-conditioning, smoke can stink up the whole place. Smoke can also trigger asthma and irritate throats. Food can become bland and smells come from nearby smoke. It is easy to see that restaurants can lose non-smoking customers as a result. Smoking in public has already influenced and encouraged youth to smoke. If places such as restaurants and hawker centres allow smoking, youth will undoubtedly learn to smoke from the adults. Hence, in my honest opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and hawker centres."

In fact, I feel that smoking should be banned completely. Smoking has been known to cause heart disease, stroke, asthma, and more. Cigarette smoke also contains a great number of harmful carcinogenic chemicals, and greatly increases an individual's risk of developing cancer, especially lung cancer, later in life. Smoking in pregnant women can lead to stillbirths, miscarriages, premature delivery, and low birth weight infants. In fact, a study in the United Kingdom showed smoking causes more deaths than drugs, alcohol, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suicide, homicide, and car crashes combined. How can Singapore, who has such severe punishments (caning, hanging, etc.) for drugs, allow this even bigger mass murderer continue to get around scot-free? Not to mention, in the case of drugs, there are a number that have no long-lasting ill-effects. Usually, only drug users themselves suffer from adverse health effects from the drugs, but that is not so in the case of smoking. Smoking not only has long-term harmful effects on the user themselves, but also on the people around them. It can even be argued that more than the smoker, passive smokers suffer worse effects. Most cigarettes have filters that filter out most of the harmful carcinogenic chemicals, preventing the smoker from inhaling them in. Second-hand smokers, on the other hand, do not have the advantage of the filter, and breathe in all the secondhand smoke. Hence, according to Mill's Harm Principle, we should completely ban smoking."

However, I do believe that we have to take into account the interests of smokers to a certain degree. The primary issue at stake is secondhand smoke, which is a problem that arises when smoking is permitted in a place that non-smokers frequent. Research has shown that secondhand smoke can be even more harmful to the body than smoking first-hand, and this is definitely an unfair negative externality that third parties have to endure. Health is a concern for every individual, and allowing others to compromise this is immensely undesirable. Yet, smokers do exist in every community. In their defense, there are smokers who have tried hard to quit, but have simply grown too reliant. Although this vice may not be easy for everyone to forgive, we have to recognise that these people, too, have interests that they are seeking to maximise. How, then, can we cater to the interests of both parties? I believe that it is possible to come to a degree of compromise. I propose that instead of implementing a blanket ban on smoking in all restaurants, smoking areas can be introduced. Care must be taken, however, to separate these areas sufficiently (perhaps by glass panels or the like) such that the smoke does not permeate non-smoking areas. The restaurants, then, will not lose their smoking customers or their non-smoking patrons. In this way, we can maximise the benefits to all stakeholders in question."

Why is smoking so popular, and in so many countries? Could it be that non-smokers have been lied to? Joking aside, I feel that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Smoking, or inhaling various gaseous substances, has been thought to be beneficial for our health and has been a part of humanity's history since the stone age. Religious groups such as the Rastafarians smoke marijuana to enter a trance-like state, which they believe brings them closer to God. In the 1840s, the Chinese addiction to that British exported led to the loss of many lives during the Opium Wars. Withdrawal from the addictive substance nicotine found in tobacco often leads to withdrawal, in which the person may suffer from fever, shivers, and diarrhoea. While smokers are also human and it would be unfair to them to have to smoke in special cubicles or walk 100 meters away from the restaurant just for a smoke, their actions encroach on the comfort of others around them and also affects their health. Perhaps a compromise, such as using a nicotine patch while in the restaurant would be beneficial to both parties without imposing on the rights of either. Nobody (I doubt even smokers) would like to have the smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the food they are about to consume."

Smoking is a social activity - smokers usually do not smoke alone; they form a group that is just like any other in society around a common topic or activity that includes and excludes people. In its worst form, it can even be a form of networking, of socializing (or smoking) your way to the top, a way of getting to know people in a relaxed, accepting atmosphere of common interest. Smoking in restaurants usually takes this form and that means extended periods of smoking with a large group of people puffing away for hours on end. While it is definitely tempting to ban smoking from all restaurants, smokers are generally considerate enough not to smoke in enclosed areas, bringing most of the harmful smoke outside in the open air, usually in a labeled smoking area. Even if customers are annoyed, that should not be sufficient reason to ban a group of people, regardless of whether they are smoking or not. It would deprive them of the opportunity to eat at any restaurant in the country."

Banning smoking in restaurants would encourage more smokers to quit their smoking habit since they would have a hard time finding a place to have a cigarette. Additionally, a smoking ban will encourage a healthier environment in restaurants, since there will not be any second-hand smoke inhaled by customers. This is especially important for family-friendly restaurants with children, since children are at a higher risk of being affected by secondhand smoke. However, I feel that it is impractical for smoking to be banned at all restaurants. Smokers would feel that they are not being given the space to smoke and would feel discriminated against with such policies. Additionally, restaurant owners may not be happy with such a rule because it could drive away customers who are smokers from frequenting their restaurant. Therefore, while it is ideal that smoking be banned from all the restaurants, it is not practical to do so, especially when smokers account for quite a percentage of society. I believe the type of restaurant should determine if smoking were to be banned or not."

I will take any job and do my best to earn as much money as I can, although I may feel unhappy if the job is tough enough. I would be willing to do a part-time job during my free time outside of school. Also, I look at it as a good opportunity for me to gain work experience. It may be beneficial during my next job search. It also provides me with an environment to learn communication skills and understand more about work culture.

It is hard for my family to pay the money required. Although the wages for part-time jobs are not high enough, there is no doubt that it can help lessen the total amount. Secondly, a university graduate cannot fit all the requirements that employers ask for. We can learn from experiences doing part-time jobs, for example communication skills through interactions with clients or other useful skills. This is a prerequisite for getting a well-paying job and it just makes life happier. To conclude, having a part-time job has many benefits, so it is highly recommended. Just find a job now!"

According to a survey, many employers in Hong Kong point out the main problems with fresh graduates are their lack of work experience and communication skills in talking with strangers or clients. The benefits mentioned above could be gained by effectively having a part-time job. It is well-known that Universities have already set up a platform to provide many resources for students, like summer internships in Hong Kong or overseas. So students should treasure their valuable time during summer break and winter break by equipping themselves for their future. However, I definitely discourage students from doing part-time jobs during the study period. It should be noted that the first priority for them is to seek knowledge and not waste most of their time in gaining a limited amount of money, especially to those waste their pay on meaningless entertainment! Apart from studying and working, students should also widen their social networks in University by participating in extra-curricular activities. Work hard, play hard!"

First, students can acquire knowledge. Second, a part-time job is a good start for a students’ career preparations. By doing a part-time job, university students acquire life skills that will never be gained in class. In class, what students have learnt so far is entirely theoretical knowledge or concepts, such as mathematical equations in Physics or grammar usage in English writing. University students gain enough academic knowledge; however, they know little about the life skills which are extremely important for them to make a living. By having a part-time job, students have the chance to be exposed to practical society and from this experience they will gain life skills. For example, being a coordinator of public relations, a student will learn the art of communicating with different kinds of people properly. Thus, having a part-time job is beneficial for career preparation. In the short term, students have an invaluable opportunity to put their book knowledge to practical use. The knowledge gained in class is taught to be used by the students for their future careers. There is an old saying that says, “practice makes perfect.” Applying knowledge to practice, students will have a deeper understanding of what they learn. In the long term, the experience of doing a part-time job is helpful evidence of a student's capability for future job applications. As demonstrated above, acquisition of life skills and knowledge are guaranteed by having a part-time job. Students who have work experience are more likely to get hired because companies are more willing to hire those who are more experienced. Due to the two reasons described above, the significance of having a part-time job for a university student is quite clear."

First of all, most parents will stop giving their children money after graduation from high school. University students need to earn money in order to maintain their daily spending. Getting a part-time job is exactly the way to solve this problem. Secondly, most University students will buy a lot of things like iPhones, MacBooks, cell phones, clothing, and other things. These products are quite expensive for them, so if they want to keep buying these luxury goods, they must work during their spare time to earn more and save as much as possible before it is enough to buy a product. Thirdly, having a part-time job is a way for University students to use their time wisely. For example, they may have some days off every week and as there are no lessons on those days, it is quite common to want to have something to do rather than staying at home. So, students will think of working part-time, which is a way that they can earn money and spend their spare time in a meaningful way. In conclusion, it is important for university students to have a part-time job simply for economic reasons."

However, I don't think it is important for students to have a part-time job for several reasons. According to research done by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, University students who have part-time jobs have shown a decline in the performance of their studies, as they are often distracted by their jobs. Some may even make being a truant a habit since they are tired after working. Some may argue that students who have part-time jobs can earn money on their own, and thus can become financially independent and help relieve the financial burdens of their families. But this is not the case, since many students who have part-time jobs seldom pay tuition fees by themselves, and they would rather use the money they earn to buy luxury and pricey products that their parents can hardly afford. So, their parents still need to pay their tuition fees and give them pocket money. This will make students more and more materialistic and brand-addicted. Lastly, students may become demotivated in their studying. When they have a part-time job, their timetable will be so tight that they don't even have time to hang out with friends, and they will eventually become disconnected with their friends and feel isolated. Hence, they may lose motivation to study because they are not happy with their school and social lives. Therefore, I don't think it is important for university students to have part-time jobs."

It's true that part-time jobs can let us practice our abilities, but it also takes a lot of time. Does a part-time job provide benefit to University students? It depends on how much you learn and how much you are paid. For business school students, it's very important to have a part-time job because they really need internships to gain practical experience. When business school students graduate, they will not sit in labs or classrooms. Business school students aim to earn money and they need real experience, not only the knowledge in textbooks. Besides studying, they have lots of spare time and the best way to use the time is to do a part-time job, rather than play computer games all day. But for science students, it may not be so important to have a part-time job. Science school students spend most of their time in labs or libraries. The most important thing for them is to gain lab skills and knowledge from core courses, so they don't have to pay much attention to having a part-time job."

There are three main reasons. Students can obtain experience from having a part-time job. Most students need to work after they graduate, and it will not be easy to work if they haven't had a job before, since they will have no experience. Having a part-time job is a straight-forward way for students to get some work experience. Most employers prefer students with work experience because these students can become used to their jobs faster. Having some part-time job experience will give students an advantage when they are applying for jobs. Students with a part-time job will treasure what they get from their parents. Before having a job, it is too abstract for students to understand that earning money is not easy. If a student has a job, they will learn that working is not relaxing and they have to work hard to earn money. Then they will know that for their parents, too, it is not easy to earn a living, and thus they will treasure what they get from their parents. Students can earn money from a part-time job. University students are adults, so they should no longer spend their parents' money. Having a part-time job is a way for them to earn what they need, and they can relieve the heavy burden from their parents.

Some part-time jobs in particular match with students’ own field of study and may enhance their chance of learning and applying what they learn in classes. However, one should not say that a part-time job is an obligation. As some University students are supposed to be future scholars and professors in their own fields, they need to focus more on their academic work. For example, a professional scientist, mathematician, historian, or sociologist need not gain work experience. It is easy to see that professors and scholars need more advanced skills like critical thinking, methodology, and modeling to explain phenomena. On the other hand, a part-time job trains students in practical skills like document work or even manual labor. These skills have clearly no relation to some students’ future research. They could gain nothing from doing a part-time job, and lose time for their further studies and research. For them, a part-time job is just an obstacle to their success. University education is supposed to be free and student-oriented. If a student wants to have their career in practical fields or industry, they may have a part-time job to gain experience. If a student has already decided to continue to study and live with knowledge and research, a part-time job means nothing to them. Therefore, the importance of part-time jobs depend on one's ambition. It should not be regarded as 'important,' simply 'useful.'"

Firstly, taking a part-time job can give students with the chance to learn more about teamwork, as they may need to finish a proposal with other people. Most jobs, such as the job of sales manager, involve team work and everyone needs to operate with each other well no matter what position in the company. Also, their communication skills may improve, as they need to talk with strangers. Taking a part-time job is helpful for students’ personal development. First, they can learn about their interests, weaknesses, or strengths if they try different part-time jobs. This can build up student's confidence as well as develop their own potential. Some people may argue that taking a part-time job affects the academic performance of students.

Try to imagine, how would you feel if someone smoked when you're having a wonderful meal with your lover in a restaurant?

For customers, apart from the health problem and mood, the smoke will also decrease their appetite, and as a consequence many dishes or food may be discarded. In the case of restaurant owners, their revenue may greatly decrease due to the loss of non-smoking customers.

Admittedly, for most smokers, it would certainly be enjoyable for themselves to smoke when they are having a meal, but this would be a catastrophe for others at the same restaurant. Much research has already proven that the smoke will do three times more harm to the victim who breathes smoke from the cigarettes. Being a kind of public place, restaurants are the kind of open space where once a smoker smokes, the rest of the customers will also be affected. As a result, it's obvious that smoking at restaurants will do harm to others. For the goal of protecting the health of all the customers, we should ban smoking at all restaurants. Besides the harm of the smoke, the negative effect of smoking by polluting food is something that we should also be concerned with. Apart from its harm to lungs, which is a well-known fact already, smoking hurts the smokers' stomachs as well when they are eating at the same time. During meal times, if a smoker smokes, the ash of their cigarette will drop into the food, which will eventually go into both the smoker's and the nearby people's stomachs. The stomach of human beings is unable to digest the ash from cigarettes. As a result, the stomach gets severely hurt from smoking. In sum, as we have seen the bad effects of smoking at restaurants already, it is necessary to ban smoking at all restaurants."

Since most restaurants still have smoking areas available, it is still possible for customers and workers there to inhale those harmful gases. Therefore, all restaurants should ban smoking if they want to attract more people who don't want to endure anymore second-hand cigarette smoke. Second, it will give customers a bad impression if they find they smell lots of smoke in a restaurant. Then, they will have a bad image of that restaurant and stop going to that restaurant anymore.

There are both pros and cons of this policy. For me, I am one of the ban’s advocates. In this essay, I would like to share my view on the benefits of the policy. To start with, implementing a smoking ban can improve the working conditions of the catering and service workers, reducing the time they are exposed to the second-hand smoke of the customers. That's to say, the smoking ban can help protect the health of the workers, lowering their chances of suffering from respiratory diseases and even lung cancer. What's more, the health of the general public can also be safeguarded. It is very dangerous that non-smokers always have to suffer from the second-hand smoke of smokers, especially for pregnant women and small children because their immunity is weaker. Thus, if the smoking ban is put into force, their health can also be protected. More importantly, the policy can improve the reputation of Hong Kong as a clean city. With fewer people smoking in Hong Kong, the air quality will certainly become better, so Hong Kong will become a more attractive city for tourists. As a result, the general image of Hong Kong as an international and healthy city will be promoted further. Conclusively speaking, there are many benefits of this policy. By prohibiting smoking at all restaurants, I am convinced our citizens' health and city's image can be improved."

We all know smoking is bad for people themselves, and can affect their neighbors' health though second-hand smoke, so most restaurants should ban smoking to protect their customers' health. This also makes our city clean and healthy. But should all restaurants do so? I don't think so, because it's too strict and doesn't respect all people's rights. Some customers just want to go somewhere they can smoke and we assume people who go to the restaurants that allow smoking. Many people have a habit of smoking, and they need cigarettes to calm themselves, especially businessmen when they talk about business over dinner. We know that many successful businessmen like smoking and smoking helps them handle things better. Many people just enjoy smoking and their friends may also like it. The best way for them to have their entertainment may be having lunch with cigarettes, and a restaurant that allows smoking is their best choice for that. It's better for them to smoke in a restaurant than in other public environments. Limiting smoking to a small space is better than spreading it out."

If we are not smokers, we will feel uncomfortable, since we will breathe in the smoke. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoking harms people's health. Research has shown that smoking not only threatens smokers, but also does harm to people around the smokers. When I go to restaurants with a friend of mine, a heavy smoker, I get a sore throat. He smokes a lot in restaurants, since restaurants haven’t banned smoking. It is unfair for non-smoking people to be affected by smoking when they go to restaurants. There are usually some children in these restaurants. If smoking is not banned, these children will be affected by the smoke from cigarettes, since children are more vulnerable. Restaurants are places for having food, not smoking. It is disgusting for non-smoking customers to smell smoke when they are enjoying their food. Smoking may cause fires in restaurants if the cigarette stubs are thrown on the tablecloth, which threatens customers' lives. Smokers can smoke somewhere outside restaurants, but not in restaurants, because restaurants are not suitable places for smoking. Customers want to have a comfortable and safe place to enjoy their food, and smoking is not suitable in restaurants. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants."

It has been proven many years ago that cigarette smoke harms our health, especially secondhand smoke. Everyone has the right to be healthy and stay away from the harms of smoke. One may argue that smokers also have the right to smoke. However, banning smoking in restaurants does not affect their rights. There are many open areas for them to smoke while in restaurants, and with the closed environment and long stays, non-smokers have no way to escape the smoke. Therefore, this policy benefits non-smokers while it does not affect smokers at all. Also, we have to argue that this policy be applied to all restaurants, as opposed to just some. From time to time there have been long discussions about this issue. During that period, some restaurants decided to prohibit smoking, but soon they lost a large portion of their smoking customers. Some gradually gave up and stopped being a non-smoking restaurant. As a result, a no-smoking environment was hardly achieved for many years. When laws were passed to prohibit smoking in all public indoor areas, this situation totally changed. Since smokers can find no substitute, they have to give up smoking in restaurants. Under these fair conditions, restaurants do not lose customers at all. Finally, banning smoking in restaurants may increase the difficulty of smoking. Some smokers may consider giving up smoking. This is definitely another advantage that we could think of. Therefore, all reasons support smoking being completely banned at all restaurants."

The government has also implemented a law to ban smoking in public areas. Supporters point out that banning smoking in restaurants can improve the air quality of restaurants as well as the health of workers and customers. Other people, such as restaurant owners, argue that this can cause losses in terms of profit. As a whole, the benefits of banning smoking in all restaurants outweighs its drawbacks. First, banning smoking can improve the air quality of restaurants, as it reduces the release of secondhand smoke from smokers, which contain harmful substances such as tar and nicotine which are harmful for non-smokers and workers in restaurants. Customers still inhale secondhand smoke when sitting in non-smoking areas due to the air-conditioner systems of restaurants. Passive smoking can cause even greater harm to the health of non-smokers than active smoking. That explains why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some people argue that some smokers may not go to restaurants after banning smoking, and would result in loss of profit. They also add that at some restaurants, such as discos and bars, most customers are smokers. However, banning smoking at restaurants can improve their image and increasing numbers of non-smoking customers compensate for the reduction in the number of smoking customers. Passive smoking in bars and discos still cause harm to their workers."

It is an essential need for students. A great problem of our country is that the opportunities for jobs are very few and the working hours are not set according to hard work and labour. A student wants the type of job where he spends little time on the job and gets a handsome income in return for his work, but it is not possible for him. The employers of every field want more work in return for a small income or salary. We have two ways, either make education free for everyone or produce good jobs for students to cover the cost of their education.

Part-time jobs can help students to reorganize themselves and to refresh. As it is famous proverb, ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’. In a part-time job, students meet different people who know more about social behaviour. Then he sometimes gets appreciated for his work, but sometimes he is scolded by his boss. The job provides him with physical activity and mental refreshment. After doing his part-time job, he gets some time to do his college homework.

Most of us have experienced when people start smoking in restaurants. Since smoking causes many bad effects in our society, it must be banned in restaurants and similar places. Smoking can affect the health of women and children, and smokers lower the living standards of our society and pollute the environment. Women and children have a weaker immune system than men, and it is scientifically proven that smoking is much more harmful for the people who inhale the second-hand smoke than the smoker. The people who breathe the smoke may get lung cancer, blood cancer, have a heart attack or have some respiratory problems for a long time. Smokers also become weaker and are more susceptible to these diseases. Moreover, the upcoming generation who see adults smoking may imitate them. Some of them think that it is the sign of becoming mature, which makes them start smoking earlier to satisfy the feeling of being an adult. Their health must get worse gradually even though they are the bright future of their nation. Therefore, the efficiency and productivity in many fields decreases, which leads to a poorer society with the lack of high standard products and facilities for a comfortable life. In addition, the medicine and treatment fees for people who fall prey to smoking are so large that it takes a large sum of money from the government that could otherwise have been used for purposes such as supporting education, increasing their export business and decreasing the rate of poverty. In conclusion, I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants, public places, colleges, offices and even on the roads because it will save more people from having lung cancer and save the environment."

It is a form of drug like heroin, but it is not a pure form of drug. People first smoke it for fun with friends but it becomes a habit. The addiction to smoking becomes a part of them. The smoke which is emitted from a cigarette is very dangerous for our health. The smoker is affected directly because he takes the smoke in but the people living with him are also affected indirectly. The smoke which he emits from his mouth and from the cigarette is very dangerous for other people also. There are some abnormalities in the children of those smokers which are not observed at a younger age but can be observed when they grow older. When the smokers go to any restaurant and start smoking, the other people who are not use to this smell feel annoyed. Some people are allergic to the smell. The smell becomes part of the food. Some people feel nauseous because of the smell. So, smoking should be banned in restaurants. The advertisements should be banned, and cigarettes should be banned in shops. The younger generation is spoiled by the bad habit of smoking. It's after effects are miserable. There are many institutions who are working to stop it. We should help the people who are addicted to smoking because smoking causes skin cancer, lung cancer, TB, heart diseases. PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE."

This smoke contains toxic substances like nicotine which is bad for human health. It causes also lung disease or respiratory disease. It should be stressed by the administration of the restaurants that it is also place of public gathering where people come to eat, so the environment of such places should be healthy, so that people feel relaxed there. But if the surrounding environment of the eating place is filled with smoke, the particles present in the smoke cause different diseases by directly entering the body and they spread in the food. When people relax in that polluted environment, the air entering their lungs has a bad effect. Smoking is a very serious problem of our society.

In restaurants, smoking pollutes the food and causes stomach infections. In foreign countries, some middle- and high-level restaurants have banned smoking. Smoking contains nicotine, which makes the food dirty. A person who smokes not only decreases their lifetime but also impacts other people. If someone asks why you smoke, smokers often reply that they smoke to release tension but they know it is not good for their health, especially in restaurants because it poisons the food. Now it's our duty to save our country from the pollution and effects of smoking. Smoking should also be banned in pubs, where people also come to enjoy eating and drinking. Nicotine is a drug and its effect on the human body is very harmful and causes death. So, please stop smoking and tell people about the harmful effects.

Nowadays, a new problem of smoking has appeared. It is smoking in restaurants. Restaurants are considered to be relaxing places. Smoking there is very immoral and against the law. It not only creates an unhealthy atmosphere but also disturbs others. Smoking in restaurants is a situation which creates disturbance and hatred among the public. We should consider that anything natural must not be destroyed. Restaurants are favourable to human nature. They must not be spoiled. Moreover, steps should be taken at the individual and public levels to stop this problem. The government should make the rules and regulations concerning this problem. It is an important issue for people’s health and peace of mind. No one should be allowed to smoke in a restaurant. It is our obligation to consider the rights of others and give importance to them.

You can also gain new experiences and knowledge by working, and find opportunities for a range of careers. Moreover, you can transform what you've learned in class into practice, and learn how to cooperate with others and deal with different challenges. The best thing that a part-time job does is enable you to help your family in terms of money. Yet, a bad thing about having a part-time job is that you don't have much time to go out with your loved ones.

By using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore.

Work experience can help us, as college students, to find the ideal job more easily in the future. Moreover, we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may occur in our future working lives. As college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationships by having a part-time job. In recent years, interpersonal relationships have become the most important factor in our work environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues and friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I read an article which said that without friends, we cannot do anything perfectly. I have the same belief that interpersonal relationships are very important in our daily lives.

These experiences could lead us to a challenging life. You will learn how to synchronize your activities, organize yourself, and manage your time between your job and studies. Nowadays, some companies choose people who have good job experience, rather than those who are inexperienced. It will be easier to adapt to your company when you have good experience. We can also connect some of the ideas we have from our work experience to our studies. Having good experience can lead you to success and provide good opportunities when you finish your education. Your work experience will create a strong impression on potential employers. Although it takes away time for leisure, the advantages that students gain are worth it. When you work hard in your job, the most immediate reward is the money that you earn. It feels good when you use the money that you earn from your job. You can help your parents with any financial problems when you pay for something, like utility expenses. Both you and your parents can appreciate the things that you have done while you are still a teenager when you are already working and helping your family with expenses.

Part-time jobs also go a long way by helping students to gain practical knowledge of what they are being taught in school. When we have a part time job during college, it also equips us with new knowledge regarding professional ethics and codes of conduct at our work place, which is an experience that may come in handy later in life. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. As you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as few as possible. Lastly, it is always good to have money. While money may not be the most important thing in life, it does buy things such as food, heat, and a roof. It buys things like college degrees (brains are needed for those too) but overall money is a pretty important thing to have, and I would definitely say that those without a job are lacking in money and responsibility.

Maybe some college students don't want a part-time job, thinking that it would be hard for them to have a job and at the same time go to school. Yet, as a college student, it would be better if the majority of students try to have a part-time job. First, it could help financially.

Having a part-time job is not a disgrace, and it is not a reason to put down a student. For me, a part-time job should not only be for students who do not have much money, but also for students who do have money as it can teach them that money is not just a  thing, and make them realize that they should be responsible, study hard, and be wise by spending their money in useful ways."

Being a working student, your time is reduced, and you lose your focus on some things. I don’t think that there shouldn’t be working students, I only think that having to work at the same time as studying is difficult, so I salute working students. There are a disadvantages and advantages to being a working student. One disadvantage, as I said earlier, is that your time is reduced. One advantage is that you can help yourself in terms of studying at the same time as helping your family. Being a working student is so challenging because you need to balance your time. It is a matter of time management and discipline and of multiplying your time rather than dividing it.

Scientists are sure that passive smoking is equally harmful to our health.

Every year more and more babies are born ill or even dead because of their mother’s bad habit.

In fact, everyone must respect other people's feelings and we must cooperate with each other. In conclusion, I want to say that banning smoking is a necessary measure for the health of the nation.

We all know that many people smoke nowadays, so it's common to see people smoking everywhere they go. Some smokers don't agree with banning smoking in restaurants or even bars, but they should also consider the health of others. They should be considerate of the people who do not smoke, and of people who have lung problems such as asthma. Many people today are dying because of the lung cancer caused by smoking and/or second-hand smoke. People that smoke know the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke, and therefore they should be aware where and when it is appropriate to smoke and where and when it is not. Therefore, I agree with the banning of smoking in public places. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of others.

Unfortunately, these expectations are often spoiled by the odour of smoke. More and more countries have decided to ban smoking in all public places, including restaurants and coffee shops. Despite all of the evidence that smoking causes lung cancer and other severe conditions, there are still many citizens who smoke in our society. Should the government prohibit all of these people from smoking in public places? In my opinion, they certainly should. First and foremost, as we know, smoking in crowded places is harmful not only to the smoker but also to all of the people standing around that person who breathe in their contaminated smoke. When one individual decides to light up a cigarette, everyone around them has to breathe in nicotine from the air. Secondly, it is very uncomfortable for non-smoking people to go to a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke wafts. For instance, when a family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for non-smokers to ensure that the children do not have contact with unhealthy smoke. Finally, if smoking is banned, there would be fewer smokers on our streets. Thus, if this prohibition is imposed, perceptions of people would certainly change. To sum up, banning smoking from public places will only have advantages."

It is a hard habit to stop because tobacco contains chemicals like nicotine, which is highly addictive. As with heroin and other addictive drugs, the body and brain quickly become used to cigarettes, so the person needs them to feel normal. Some think smoking is cool and a way to become popular. Other people start smoking because they are influenced by their family members or friends. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in our country because if many people continue to smoke, for second-hand smokers, exposure has a possibility after many years to cause cancer or heart disease. This is because every time we inhale cigarette smoke, we inhale extremely harmful chemicals. Smoking can also influence other people to smoke cigarettes because they can see you smoking, especially teenagers. If smoking is banned in our country it will help us a lot. It will protect our health, reduce health risks, protect non-smokers and children, and that's why smoking should be banned across the country."

Smoking should be banned, not only in restaurants, but I think in all public places. Smoking is almost as bad for people who do not smoke because if they go out to a restaurant they would be able to smell the smoke coming from smokers. Smoking is dangerous to our health, it can cause many kinds of illnesses that can affect our body and cause death. Also, due to smoking, many innocent people who are not smokers are affected, and I think that second-hand smoking is worse for them than for the person who is smoking. Now, I think there are already a law stating that if you're caught smoking in public places, someone will arrest you and you will pay a penalty. I think if we collect the money that will otherwise go to buying cigarettes, we will collect more money that can be donated instead being spent on cigarettes. In this way, our health will not be in danger, and most of all, we will help other people through the small amounts of money donated."

Because smoking is dangerous to our health, the government should empower people all over the country to quit to help our environment as well as our bodies. If people do not follow the law, the government should give them sanctions or punishments so they do not to do it again. Vendors should not have any cigarettes in their stores to avoid smoking everywhere, because we all know that smoking is an addiction, and that cigarettes are very harmful to our body because they affect our lungs, teeth, and gums. To improve our health, the government should provide information that our body will become healthy, and not smoking will improve our country and environment. The government should provide good healthcare for the whole country so they can develop their own beliefs about this project. The government should confiscate cigarettes to reduce pollution. All of the funds that they will get can be used to help build a foundation for street children so they can have a proper education. I therefore conclude that the government should impose the NO SMOKING CAMPAIGN across the country."

There is a part of me that agrees with this statement, and a part that does not agree. I agree because, as an individual who does not smoke, it is very annoying for me to smell and inhale the smoke coming from cigarettes. Moreover, in the kinds of restaurants we have in our country, the smell of smoke will last because they are fully air-conditioned. Yet on the other hand, while I do not agree, there is no law that says smoking is banned in restaurants. A lot of people smoke for relaxation and/or for their metabolism, and others smoke because they just can't resist it, it is their hobby or part of their daily routine. However, I always think about how they can continue smoking while seeing others who can hardly breathe when they inhale the smoke coming from their cigarettes. Everyone should care about each other. Maybe one of the best solutions in that people should be held responsible for smoking in restaurants or public place to decrease the number of those who get lung cancer, the risk of those who have asthma, and to decrease the pollution in the air. The best solution is to quit smoking, get a better hobby, and live a healthy life."

So why are there are still smokers? Are they not aware of the risks, not only to smokers, but also to innocent people who are around them? Smoking destroys the lives of families, including infants and those who are pregnant. In our country, cigarette smoking is one of the causes of death. One way to avoid the risk from smokers is to ban them from public places, like from all of the restaurants in the country. This is not tolerant to smokers, but it is one way of setting limitations. Why restaurants? We all know that in restaurants there are a lot of different people of different ages, and we cannot avoid of this incident. First, we should consider the younger people who go to restaurants, we should keep them away from harm or danger. Second, we should make sure that food safety is maintained before we eat it. Lastly, for the sake of formality in restaurants, banning smoking is a way to regulate cleanliness and orderliness. As a large number of people can breathe in a smoker's cigarette smoke, smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country to maintain health and safety, because we must always remember that smoking can cause death."

Smoking is fatal, and many people know that smoking can cause cancer and other illness. Smoking worsens asthma; having asthma myself, I avoid people who smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because restaurants are for people who want to eat, and not for those who just want to smoke. Cigarettes have many chemicals, and if those chemicals  get into the food, we will eat them and they could cause illness. If we don't smoke, we can prevent cancer and illness. Smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazard. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous for people with pre-existing conditions. Addiction to cigarettes is both mental and physical. Cigarette addicts do physically crave cigarettes, but they are also addicted to the act and the lifestyle. Banning smoking in restaurants will discourage customers who enjoy smoking while they eat or drink alcohol. For smokers who go to restaurants often, this will be an inconvenience which will have positive effects on their health, whether they like it or not."
